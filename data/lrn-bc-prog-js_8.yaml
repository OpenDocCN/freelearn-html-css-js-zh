- en: Welcome to the final chapter of the book. By now, you will have gained an in-depth
    knowledge of blockchain functions and how they are built. You must be getting
    excited to build your very own blockchain and explore its various functionalities!

  zh: 欢迎来到本书的最后一章。到目前为止，你已经对区块链功能及其构建有了深入的了解。你一定对构建自己的区块链并探索其各种功能感到兴奋！
- en: Before we conclude this book, let's have a quick review of what we've learned
    so far and explore what improvements or amendments we can make to our blockchain
    to make it more secure and reliable.

  zh: 快速回顾
- en: With the completion of the previous chapter, we are done building our blockchain.
    If you think about how much you have accomplished throughout the entirety of this
    book, it's pretty impressive.

  zh: 随着上一章的完成，我们已经建立好了我们的区块链。如果你想想你在整本书中取得了多少成就，那是相当令人印象深刻的。
- en: We started with nothing, and from there, we built a blockchain data structure,
    followed by an API to interact with it. We then turned our API into a decentralized
    blockchain network, and synchronized the data across the entire network running
    on multiple different nodes.

  zh: 我们从零开始，建立了一个区块链数据结构，然后创建了一个与之交互的API。然后我们将我们的API转变为一个去中心化的区块链网络，并在多个不同节点上同步了整个网络的数据。
- en: We then created a **consensus** algorithm to make sure that the data on all
    of our nodes was synchronized and legitimate. Finally, we built a block explorer
    to explore our blockchain through a user interface. Throughout this entire book,
    we have built a lot of functionalities, as well as an awesome blockchain prototype.

  zh: 然后，我们创建了一个**共识**算法，以确保所有节点上的数据是同步和合法的。最后，我们建立了一个区块浏览器，通过用户界面来探索我们的区块链。在整本书中，我们建立了许多功能，以及一个令人印象深刻的区块链原型。
- en: One important thing that you must be aware of is that, throughout this book,
    we have been running all five of our nodes on one computer.

  zh: 你必须意识到的一件重要的事情是，在整本书中，我们一直在一台计算机上运行我们的五个节点。
- en: However, if you were to download this entire project onto multiple different
    computers, you would be able to run each node on a separate computer to really
    simulate how a decentralized blockchain network works.

  zh: 然而，如果你将整个项目下载到多台不同的计算机上，你就可以在每台计算机上运行每个节点，真正模拟去中心化的区块链网络是如何工作的。
- en: You would just have to make sure that every computer running your project is
    on the same network. Instead of having a localhost address, you would just have
    the IP address that each node is running on.

  zh: 你只需要确保每台运行你的项目的计算机在同一个网络上。你不再需要本地主机地址，而是需要每个节点运行的IP地址。
- en: Try experimenting with this idea. It's pretty cool to see your blockchain network
    running across multiple different computers.

  zh: 改进的领域
- en: Now, there are a few areas where the blockchain could be improved. One of those
    areas is in error handling. Throughout this book, we didn't do much error handling,
    because we were focusing on getting the actual functionalities to work correctly,
    but to improve this blockchain we would definitely want to do a lot of error handling.
    This would ensure that our blockchain can't be hacked, and also make sure that
    it runs correctly.

  zh: 现在，有一些可以改进的地方。其中之一是错误处理。在整本书中，我们并没有做太多的错误处理，因为我们专注于确保实际功能的正确运行，但为了改进这个区块链，我们肯定需要做很多错误处理。这将确保我们的区块链不会被黑客攻击，并确保它的正确运行。
- en: Another area where this blockchain could be improved is when we are making transactions.
    Right now, when we make transactions, we send a certain amount of Bitcoin from
    one person to another, but at no point do we validate that the sender actually
    has this bitcoin to send.

  zh: 另一个可以改进这个区块链的领域是在进行交易时。目前，当我们进行交易时，我们从一个人发送一定数量的比特币给另一个人，但我们从来没有验证发送方是否真的有这些比特币可以发送。
- en: One exercise we would encourage you to do is to go to our `createTransaction`
    method in our blockchain data structure, and then find a way to verify that the
    sender actually has the amount of Bitcoin to send. This would be a good practice
    project for you to try on your own. You would have to get the current balance
    of bitcoin that the sender has, and do a check to validate that they have enough
    Bitcoin to send in the transaction.

  zh: 我们鼓励你尝试一下我们区块链数据结构中的`createTransaction`方法，并找到一种验证发送方是否真的有足够比特币发送的方法。这对你来说是一个很好的实践项目。你需要获取发送方当前的比特币余额，并进行验证，确保他们有足够的比特币进行交易。
- en: Another way that this blockchain could be improved is by making it into a decentralized
    application platform similar to Etherium. You would do this simply by adding a
    functionality to the blockchain that would allow you to store more data inside
    of each block, allowing you to store different types of data inside of each block,
    instead of just transactions. For example, you could store user data, administrative
    data, or any other type of data inside of each block. You would then use that
    data when you are generating the hash for each block, just like we use the transactions
    when we are generating the hashes.

  zh: 这个区块链的另一个改进方式是将其打造成类似以太坊的去中心化应用平台。你只需要向区块链添加一个功能，允许你在每个区块内存储更多的数据，可以存储不同类型的数据，而不仅仅是交易。例如，你可以在每个区块内存储用户数据、管理数据或任何其他类型的数据。然后在生成每个区块的哈希时使用这些数据，就像我们在生成交易时使用哈希一样。
- en: There are a lot of ways that you can customize and improve on the blockchain
    we've built; however, right now, we have a fully functioning prototype blockchain
    that can be hosted on a decentralized blockchain network.

  zh: 我们建立的区块链有很多定制和改进的方式；然而，现在，我们有一个完全功能的原型区块链，可以托管在去中心化的区块链网络上。

    fun building the blockchain that we created!
