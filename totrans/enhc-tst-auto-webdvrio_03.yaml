- en: In this chapter, we are going to cover the techniques for creating and debugging
    a custom WebdriverIO framework. This will take us through the services that help
    keep the project up to date. A lot of files get used and interact with each other
    in the project. Helpers and other features will be added to help enhance the framework
    as well as make debugging easier. We will cover the node files of the framework
    and demonstrate the differences between launching tests on Mac and Windows operating
    systems. We will also create our first hook customization for debugging on a single
    monitor. Lastly, we will write our first log wrapper to take more control over
    the output in the console window to improve debugging efficiency by customizing
    logging.

- en: CodeGPT generates the TypeScript code for the factorial function, which takes
    an input number, `n`, and recursively calculates its factorial. This is just one
    example of how CodeGPT can simplify coding tasks by providing accurate and efficient
    code snippets.

    asked for an advanced function that parses values from a string in the `key=value`
    format that could be transposed into a dictionary object with some examples. GitHub
    Copilot already knew of the SwitchboardFactory SBF object and came up with this
    function with a header:'

- en: In this chapter, we reviewed the node files of the Webdriver node framework.
    We showed you how to make launching tests common between Mac and Windows team
    members. We also showed you how to set up the environment to enable debugging
    and writing better code in TypeScript. Finally, we wrote our first custom log
    wrapper, which optimized the output to the console window.

- en: By taking control of logging, we can make our debugging process more productive
    by deciding how it’s formatted and what is sent to the Allure report. In upcoming
    chapters, we will even add color for visibility and apply this same wrapper concept
    to the most common WebdriverIO browser methods to make supercharged robust tests.
