    the current page's position, as compared to the whole website. Let's consider

    might be **Home** | **Apparels** | **Jeans** | **Bare jeans**. This is an example
    of a breadcrumb. Google and other search engines use breadcrumbs to properly understand
    a website's hierarchy and the organization of its sub pages.

    will let Bootstrap's JavaScript understand which component to hide when the button
    element is clicked on. To display a cross character inside the alert, you should

    components of Bootstrap. These components are generally used to give a better
    user experience to the users of the application. We saw how to use breadcrumbs,
    paginations, labels and badges, and jumbotrons. We understood what alerts are
