<p>What excites me about Svelte? Its simplicity, elegance, and pragmatic design ethos. Its growing success in the marketplace suggests that other programmers feel the same way too. I’m not surprised by this. When we write software for the JavaScript ecosystem, we have a choice: we can either accept and be consumed by the complexity of its primary constituents (React, Node.js, webpack, Babel, and so on) or we can actively seek out the marginalized products and processes that aim to simplify <span class="No-Break">our work.</span></p>
<p>It’ll be no surprise to you that I place <strong class="bold">Test-Driven Development</strong> (<strong class="bold">TDD</strong>) firmly in this second camp. Because without it, what you have is a development workflow that largely consists of chasing bugs and carrying a lot of context in your head. This is always what I think of as the <em class="italic">bad </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">old days</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
<p>When I first started programming as a youngster, I remember the infuriating experience of debugging – writing some code, trying it out, finding bugs, and struggling for hours to figure out where the errors were hidden in my code. It seemed like a natural part of programming: devoting a large portion of my time to debugging. And this carried through into my first job as a C++ desktop application developer. (It wasn’t long before I discovered TDD and how it could help me have a simpler, quieter, <span class="No-Break">calmer life.)</span></p>
<p>Then there’s the mental context you need when you plan out a grand design for the next feature you’re about to implement. You have to know where you’re at, what you’ve done, and what’s next, and do your best to not stray from the path. That’s hard when you’re being derailed by debugging and <span class="No-Break">other distractions.</span></p>
<p>Sure, you can write a to-do list or keep a diary, but why not write some automated tests instead? They not only remind you where you’re at but they check for <span class="No-Break">bugs, too.</span></p>
<p>That is essentially the idea <span class="No-Break">behind TDD.</span></p>
<p>And if you like Svelte because it simplifies your life and makes you feel like you’re swimming rather than wading through mud, I think you’ll also like TDD. This book shows you the how and why of Svelte with TDD. I hope you enjoy it. Thanks <span class="No-Break">for reading!</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>If you’re a Svelte programmer, this book is for you. I aim to show you how TDD can improve your work. If you’re already knowledgeable about TDD, I hope there’s still a lot you can learn from comparing your own process <span class="No-Break">with mine.</span></p>
<p>If you don’t already know Svelte, but you’re familiar with any modern frontend framework such as React, you should be able to follow along and pick things up as you go. TDD is a wonderful platform for explaining new technologies, and it’s entirely plausible that you’ll be able to pick up Svelte simply by following <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
<p>There are two ways to read <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
<p>The first is to use it as a reference when you are faced with specific testing challenges. Use the index to find what you’re after and move to <span class="No-Break">that page.</span></p>
<p>The second, and the one I’d recommend starting with, is to follow the walk-throughs step by step, building your own code base as you go along. The companion GitHub repository has a directory for each chapter (such as <strong class="source-inline">Chapter01</strong>) and then, within that, <span class="No-Break">two directories:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="source-inline">Start</strong>, which is the starting point for the chapter; you should start here if you’re following along.</li>
<li><strong class="source-inline">Complete</strong>, which contains completed solutions to all the exercises.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will need to be at least a little proficient with <strong class="bold">Git</strong>; a basic understanding of the <strong class="source-inline">branch</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">checkout</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">clone</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">commit</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">diff</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">merge</strong> commands should <span class="No-Break">be sufficient.</span></p>
<p>Take a look at the <strong class="source-inline">README.md</strong> file in the GitHub repository for more information and instructions on working with the <span class="No-Break">code base.</span></p>
<p><strong class="bold">If you are using the digital version of this book, we advise you to type the code yourself or access the code from the book’s GitHub repository (a link is available in the next section). Doing so will help you avoid any potential errors related to the copying and pasting </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">of code.</strong></span></p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-11"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"/>Conventions used</h1>
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
<p><strong class="source-inline">Code in text</strong>: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. Here is an example: “We can start with a test that specifies what this <strong class="source-inline">Birthday</strong> component will do with its <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">name</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> prop.”</span></p>
<p>A block of code is set <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
<pre class="source-code">
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import {
  render,
  screen
} from '@testing-library/svelte';
import Birthday from './Birthday.svelte';</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set <span class="No-Break">in bold:</span></p>
<pre class="source-code">
describe('Birthday', () =&gt; {
  it('displays the name of the person', () =&gt; {
    <strong class="bold">render(Birthday, { name: 'Hercules' });</strong>
  });
});</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
<pre class="console">
mkdir birthdays
cd birthdays
npm create svelte@latest</pre>
<p><strong class="bold">Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see onscreen. For instance, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in <strong class="bold">bold</strong>. Here is an example: “The user clicks the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Save</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> button.”</span></p>
