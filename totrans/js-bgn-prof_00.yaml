- en: JavaScript is an amazing multi-functional language that is used a lot for web
    development (among other things). Any interaction that happens on web pages is
    JavaScript in action. In fact, all modern browsers understand JavaScript—and soon
    you will understand it too.

- en: This book deals with everything you need to know to create JavaScript applications
    and use JavaScript on web pages. By the time you finish this book, you'll be capable
    of creating interactive web pages, dynamic applications, and a lot more as you
    progress on your professional JavaScript journey!

- en: To get started with this book, you don't need any JavaScript experience. However,
    if you do have some coding experience, you're likely to go through the book and
    exercises with a bit more ease. Basic familiarity with HTML and CSS would be of
    benefit. If you're a first-time programmer, we are honored to welcome you to the
    world of programming in this book. It may seem difficult in the beginning, but
    we'll guide you right through it.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 1*, *Getting Started with JavaScript*, covers some fundamentals of
    the JavaScript language that you''ll have to know to understand the rest of the
    book.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 2*, *JavaScript Essentials*, deals with essentials such as variables,
    data types, and operators.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 3*, *JavaScript Multiple Values*, covers how to store multiple values
    in one variable using arrays and objects.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 4*, *Logic Statements*, is where the real fun starts: we are going
    to use logic statements to make decisions for us!'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 5*, *Loops*, accounts for situations when it is necessary to repeat
    a block of code, which is what we use loops for. We are using different types
    of loops, such as the `for` and the `while` loop.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 6*, *Functions*, introduces a very useful block for repeating code
    snippets: functions! This enables us to invoke a specified code block at any time
    in our script to do something for us. This will help you to not repeat yourself,
    which is one of the fundamental principles of writing clean code.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 7*, *Classes*, continues with building blocks of JavaScript that help
    us to structure our application better. We have already seen how to create objects,
    and with classes we learn how to create a template for objects that we can reuse
    anytime we need that particular type of object.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 8*, *Built-In JavaScript Methods*, deals with some great built-in
    functionality. Functions are something we can write ourselves, but we''ll find
    ourselves using the built-in JavaScript functions often whenever we need to do
    common tasks, such as checking whether something is a number or not.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 9*, *The Document Object Model*, dives into the browser object model
    and document object model (DOM). This is going to enrich the way we can use JavaScript
    by a lot. We''ll learn what the DOM is, and how we can affect it with JavaScript
    and change our websites by doing so.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 10*, *Dynamic Element Manipulation Using the DOM*, demonstrates how
    to manipulate the elements of the DOM dynamically, which will enable you to create
    modern user experiences. We can change our website as a response to user behavior
    such as clicking on a button.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 11*, *Interactive Content and Event Listeners*, takes our responses
    to the user to the next level. For example, we are going to learn how to respond
    to events such as the cursor leaving an input box and the mouse of the user moving.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 12*, *Intermediate JavaScript*, deals with topics that you''ll need
    to write intermediate JavaScript code, such as regular expressions, recursion,
    and debugging, to boost the performance of your code.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 13*, *Concurrency*, introduces the topic of concurrency and asynchronous
    programming, which will allow our code to do multiple things at the same time
    and be truly flexible.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 14*, *HTML5, Canvas, and JavaScript*, focuses on HTML5 and JavaScript.
    We''ll have seen a lot of both HTML and JavaScript in the previous chapters, but
    here we''ll be focusing on the HTML5-specific features, such as the canvas element.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 15*, *Next Steps*, explores the next steps you could take after you''ve
    gotten all the fundamental features of JavaScript down and you are able to write
    nifty programs using JavaScript. We''ll take a look at some of the famous JavaScript
    libraries and development frameworks, such as Angular, React, and Vue, and we''ll
    have a look at Node.js to see how the backend can be written in JavaScript.'

- en: Previous coding experience will help, but is definitely not required. If you
    have a computer with a text editor (such as Notepad or TextEdit, not Word!) and
    a browser, you can get started with this book. We encourage you to engage with
    the exercises and projects, and experiment continually while you go through the
    chapters, to ensure you are comfortable with each concept before moving on.
