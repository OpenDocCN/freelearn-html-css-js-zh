    which allows the fast and easy downloading of new brushes and other assets, and
    the ability to create animations in the program. In this chapter, we will explore
    both options and how to use them.

    to create an account and log in to Assets. Then, we are going to learn about the
    interface of Assets, and how to search for assets you want, even actually downloading
    a sample asset. We will move on to get to know ways to create an animation in
    Clip Studio Paint with two example steps, and finally, learn how to export the
    animation.

    by doing some activities on Clip Studio Assets such as uploading materials you
    made, but Gold costs money. In order to download priced assets, you first have
    to purchase Gold from Celsys. At the time of writing, 1,000 Gold costs around
    $10\. Gold has an expiration date that is normally one year from the day of purchase,
    so if you purchase Gold, be sure to use it all before it expires!

    can be clicked and then used to narrow the search results. For instance, in the
    following screenshot, we have entered the search keyword **Heart**. If we only
    want to see Brush assets that match that keyword, click on the **Brush** option

    French, German, Spanish, Korean, Traditional Chinese, or Japanese. When you click
    on a material, you will see the translated name and the original name in brackets.
    Materials also now have a unique content ID that users can enter in the search
    bar to find specific materials. If this doesn’t return what you’re looking for,
    then it may be up to you to make that asset and put it out there for others to
    download! This is a great way to show off your Clip Studio skills, and you can
    make a little extra money too if you create a paid asset that lots of people download.

    “to give life to.” Nowadays, it is another way of saying “moving image.” It is
    a very complex art form that requires lots of study and practice to get it right.
    There are many books and internet resources, such as *The Animator’s Survival
    Kit: A Manual of Methods, Principles and Formulas for Classical, Computer, Games,
    Stop Motion and Internet Animators*, written by Richard Williams, or the *12 Principles
    of Animation* video by AlanBeckerTutorials on Youtube. They will inspire you with
    content about how to animate, the principles of animation, and tips for animating
    well. These things may be beyond the scope of this book. However, we can explore
    how to create a Clip Studio file with an animation timeline and then add animation
    cels to make our pictures have the appearance of motion. Once you are used to
    the basics of animating, I encourage you to check out these resources and refine
    your skills. Meanwhile, I just want to teach you how to create a basic animation
    – how to create an animation timeline and how to add animation cels.'

    the frame; generally, 720 x 480 for a lower resolution, 960 x 540 for a medium
    resolution, and 1280 x 720 would be considered a high-resolution animation. Under
    that option, we can set how many frames to export, the frame rate, and how many
    times to loop the animation. The standard frame rate for animated videos is often
    24 frames per second (fps), but it can vary depending on the style. For a GIF
    animation, 8 fps is good to go. At the bottom of the screen, there are two options.
    You can turn **Dithering** on to make the GIF look more naturally higher quality,
    and there is also a checkbox if you want to **make the background transparent**.
    When you press **OK**, a save location window will pop up. Navigate to the location
    you want to export the animated GIF to. Mac and PC versions of Clip Studio Paint
