    it is very likely that we would get mixed answers! A key answer of *it depends*

    JavaScript-based solutions still have value.

    from [http://playground.benbarnett.net/jquery-animate-enhanced/](http://playground.benbarnett.net/jquery-animate-enhanced/);
    although a little old, it still serves a useful purpose. It will (where possible)
    convert `.animate()` calls into CSS3 equivalents; it isn't able to convert all,
    so any that are not converted will remain as `.animate()` calls.
  prefs:

    library, GSAP—the Greensock team have made available a plugin (from [https://greensock.com/jquery-gsap-plugin](https://greensock.com/jquery-gsap-plugin)),
    that replaces `jQuery.animate()` with their own GSAP library. The latter is reputed
    to be 20 times faster than standard jQuery! With a little effort, we can look
    to rework our existing code—in place of using `.animate()`, we can add the equivalent
    CSS3 style(s) into our stylesheet and replace existing calls to `.animate()` with
    either `.removeClass()` or `.addClass()`, as appropriate.

    `.animate()`—for more details, check out the issue log at [https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2053](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2053).

    (or even jQuery). After all, we don't need to call an external library (jQuery);
    we can use styles that are already baked into the browser, right? The truth is
    not as straightforward as this—in short, the right use of either will depend on
    your requirements and the limits of each method. For example, CSS animations are
    great for simple state changes, but if sequencing is required, then you *may*
    have to resort to using the JavaScript route.

    or allow us to remove the dependency on `.animate()`, which we know is not very
    efficient! True, some of these alternatives still use jQuery, but the key here
    is that your existing code could be using any or a mix of these methods. Later
    in this chapter, we'll take a look at how we can begin to remove jQuery, and focus

    Grunt or Gulp. We can of course use a standalone GUI-based compiler for this purpose,
    but why run something like this when we can tie in much more functionality when
    using a task runner? We can even use any one of several plugins to remove vendor
    prefixes, prior to running a new compilation—this will ensure any redundant prefixes
    are removed.

    is not yet sufficiently powerful to manage complex animations. It means that we

    CSS-based animation will work, or if we have to fall back to using JavaScript-based
    libraries.

    The use of the plugin does raise a couple of useful points, so let's take a moment
    to explore what we've just created in more detail.

    plugin for one task. The `postcss-transform-shortcut` plugin is no exception:
    it takes the various elements that make up a transition rule, and puts them together
    in the right order. To see what we mean, take a look at these lines from within
    our style sheet before it is compiled:'

- en: When working with animations, there may be occasions when we need to use custom
    effects; one way to achieve this is through the use of `@keyframes`. Trouble is,
    some browsers don't support their use within media queries (yes, I'm looking at
    you, `IE10` and `IE11`!).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How does this affect us, I hear you ask? Well, if you're building any responsive
    sites, then this is absolutely something we need to bear in mind; media queries
    form the basic structure for any responsive functionality.

    plugin called `mq-keyframes`, which is available at [https://github.com/TCotton/postcss-mq-keyframes](https://github.com/TCotton/postcss-mq-keyframes).

    where animating content is concerned; it's worth using if you have to support
    these versions of Internet Explorer! The plugin can be installed in the same way
    as most other plugins for PostCSS, and does not require any additional attributes
    as part of the configuration process.

- en: Throughout the course of this chapter, we've used the small number of animation-based
    plugins that are available for PostCSS, and demonstrated some of the effects possible.
    This is all well and good, but one can't help but feel that this is a little limiting—and
    can we do something about it?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Absolutely, the beauty of PostCSS is that if there is a need for a plugin, then
    we can create something to fill that gap. A perfect example of this is the lack
    of CSS-based animation plugins available; at present, all we have is `postcss-animations`,
    which inserts animations from the `Animate.css` style sheet created by Dan Eden.
    I've used this as a basis for a new plugin—we'll use the same framework, but convert
    it to use the Magic set of animations, available from [http://www.minimamente.com/example/magic_animations/](http://www.minimamente.com/example/magic_animations/).

    plugin available from [https://github.com/postcss/postcss-easings](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-easings);
    this has some well-known easings built in, but they can easily be replaced. A
    great tool for this purpose is the site at [http://www.cubic-bezier.com](http://www.cubic-bezier.com).
    For example, if we take the `easeInExpo` easing, we create a Bezier curve that

    use in our code. It's worth noting that some sites will show this easing as `(0.05,
    0.795, 0.035)`—[http://cubic-bezier.com/](http://cubic-bezier.com/) only shows
    values to two decimal places.

    to any should be that they are kept simple, limited to one task only, and that
    where possible, you should use the PostCSS plugin boilerplate as the basis for
    creating the plugins. The plugin we used in this exercise was created manually—this
    isn't an issue if you are creating it for your own needs, and don't intend to
    publish the plugin. In the next chapter, we will explore how easy it is to create
    something using the boilerplate code—it avoids a lot of issues at a later date!

    to make the transition away from standard CSS, such as using prebuilt animation
    libraries, or using CSS3 transitions. We then switched to covering how similar
    animations would look within SASS, so we can compare use of libraries such as
    `Animate.css`, before starting the switch to using PostCSS.
