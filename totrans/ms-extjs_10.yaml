    links or fill out forms. However, in a single-page application, a user's interaction
    doesn't load a new page. Instead, it is handled within a single page and components
    react to that interaction. So how do we still allow users to use the browser's
    forward and back buttons? Using routes allows the user to use this capability
    by mapping hash tokens to controller methods.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, we have a screen to manage the Films information. Using routing,
    we can allow the user to access this screen (if the user has proper entitlements)
    and automatically selects a particular row of the Films grid by accessing `https://localhost/masteringextjs/#films/3`.
    When the user accesses this link, we can instruct the application to open the
    **Films** tab and select the row of the film that has the ID **3**.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this section, we will quickly discuss responsive design. Since it is not
    the primary topic of this book, we will implement a very simple example that will
    give us an idea of what we need to do if we need to develop a responsive application
    with Ext JS. And speaking of responsive design, we know Ext JS is great to develop
    desktop applications (that will be executed from a desktop computer or a laptop),
    but mobiles have now become a very integral part of our lives. We will figure
    out the means to run the same application running on a desktop and also on a mobile
    device. We will also discuss how to enable touch support in our application as
    well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The major difference between running an application on a desktop and a mobile
    device is the events, among other details. On a desktop, when the user clicks
    on a button, we listen to the `click` event. On a touch mobile device, there is
    no `click` event; there is the `tap` event, because we are touching the screen
    and not working with a mouse.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another detail is the size of the components. The Ext JS classic theme is really
    nice, but small for touch screens. Throughout this book, we have been using the
    `Neptune` theme, which is the default theme set to the application when we created
    it with Sencha Cmd. The `Neptune` theme has larger components than the `classic`
    theme but still is not good enough to be used on touch devices. Let's experiment!
    If you have a touch device, try executing the application we developed throughout
    this book on it. If you do not have a touch device, you need not worry; you can
    do this experiment using the Google Chrome emulator mentioned in the preceding
    topic.

    Simple mistakes, such as the name of the class (using MVC), path of CSS, and JS
    on the `index.html` file, can be verified using the **Console** or the **Network**
    tab. This tab is also very important as in some chapters we verified the parameters
    that were being sent to the server. Even though it might be the first time we
    are working with an Ext JS component, and we do not know how to handle the data
    that will be sent to the server, we can take a look at the parameters of the request
    in the **Network** tab, and then it is easier to read the correct parameters in
    the server. The same applies when we receive any information from the server,
    for example, check whether the JSON is coming as per Ext JS expectations.

- en: Testing is a very important part when developing applications or providing maintenance.
    When we do not write tests, we need to verify each use case manually, and if we
    change anything on the code, we will need to perform all the testing manually
    again. The same happens when we need to maintain the code; developers usually
    test only what has been changed, but the correct thing to do would be regression
    tests to see whether the change did not break anything else. So spending some
    time writing tests can be a win at the end. You will spend a little bit more time
    writing code, but then you will be able to run all the tests with a single click
    and then verify what is broken and what is still working.

    PHP, Ruby, C# communities offer a lot of options to perform unit tests on the
    server-side code, and sometimes, we can forget to test the frontend code (in this
    case Ext JS). But do not worry; there are a few tools we can use to include Ext
    JS on the tests as well.

    tool that is used for **Behavior-Driven Development** (**BDD**)—([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development)).
    In Ext JS documentation, you can find two guides explaining how to test Ext JS
    applications with Jasmine: [http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/4.2.0/#!/guide/testing](http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/4.2.0/#!/guide/testing)
    and [http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/4.2.0/#!/guide/testing_controllers](http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/4.2.0/#!/guide/testing_controllers).

    Siesta can also be used to test JavaScript code in general, but the cool side
    of Siesta is that it provides a special API so that we can test Ext JS applications,
    including tests on user interface components. Siesta comes with some great examples
    that can be used to start writing our own test cases.

    is a concern for a lot of companies. The minimum the user needs to load on the
    browser, the better. That is why it is very important to make a production build
    using Sencha Cmd and not simply deploy all the application files on production.

    we can also include only the CSS for the components that we are going to really
    use (just in case we create a custom theme). It is also important to create any
    application custom CSS inside the `sass/etc` or `sass/var` folders so that the
    CSS can also be added to the main CSS file generated by Sencha Cmd.

    the application looks, and the entire configuration that you need to do is done
    using the **Config** panel. Only methods, functions, and templates are free to
    enter whatever code you like. The good thing about Sencha Architect is that it
    helps to follow all the best practices and the code is very well organized. You
    can also develop all the Ext JS code using Sencha Architect, and on the server
    side, you can continue using the IDE you like the most (Eclipse, Aptana, Visual
    Studio, and others).'

    JavaScript code, among other features. It is also a paid tool, but you can download
