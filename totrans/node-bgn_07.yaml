    from the ground up to build event-driven modules. Many core libraries offer an
    events interface that can be used and extended easily. Also, Node.js provides
    a powerful events library that can be used to build event-driven modules.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the real world, events are occurrences. For example, when you click a button,
    a click event is triggered. When you receive a message, a message received event
    is triggered. When you save a file, a file saved event is triggered. Events are
    present everywhere. In Node.js, events are also present everywhere.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, when we talk about events in Node.js, we are talking about the same concept
    as in the real world. Events are occurrences, and we produce them or consume them.
    In some cases, one entity produces an event, and another entity consumes it. In
    other cases, the same entity produces and consumes the event. This can be very
    flexible; it is even possible that many entities consume the same event, or many
    entities produce the same event.

    name and the callback function. The callback function will be called when the
    event is triggered. In this case, the event name is `click`, but you can subscribe
    to many other events, such as `mouseover`, `mouseout`, `keydown`, `keyup`, `change`,
    and `submit`.

    API to handle files. We can subscribe to events and react when a file is modified.

- en: As we are already familiar with the Node.js filesystem library, let’s build
    a simple script that watches for file changes. We will use the `fs.watch` method
    to watch for file changes. This method receives two arguments, the path to the
    file to watch and a callback function that will be called when the file changes.
    The callback function receives two arguments, the event type and the filename.
    The event type can be `rename` or `change`. The `rename` event is triggered when
    the file is renamed or deleted. The change event is triggered when the file is
    modified.

    library. This library provides an `EventEmitter` class that can be used to build
    simple interface to register and unregister event listeners and emit events.

    an event listener for the `message` event. Then, we emit the `message` event with
    the message `Hello world!`. If you run the script, you will see that the message
    is printed in the console.

    this is a common practice when you want to modularize code and/or you want from
    the same event to trigger multiple actions. Let’s say that you receive an incoming
    request, and you want to store a copy of that message and also notify that to
    the final user; by using events, you can handle both actions in parallel. Let’s
    modify the previous example by adding the following code:'

    the `message` event. This event listener will be called every time the `message`
    event is emitted. Then, we register an event listener using the `once` method.
    This event listener will be called only once, but if you want to keep listening
    for more than one message, you can use `on` – for example, when you listen for
    incoming request in an HTTP server application. Finally, we use the `setTimeout`
    method to emit the `message` event after 2.5 seconds. If you run the script, you
    will see that the following output is printed:'

    This means that the event listeners are called in the same order that they are
    registered. Also, remember that you can use more channels to communicate between
    processes. In our example, we used `message`, but you can use any name you want
    or have multiple channels to better segment communication.

    is completed. This means that the `save` function does not block the execution
    of the script. In previous examples in the book, we used `then` to handle the
    result of a promise; in this case, we offered an alternative, using events that
    will allow you to decouple the logic of your application more easily.
