Throughout the last couple of years, browsers have emerged as a great platform to create immersive, complex, and beautiful applications. Most of the current applications that are being built use modern HTML5 features such as web sockets, local storage, and advanced CSS techniques for styling.</p><p>Most modern browsers, however, also have support for a technology that can be used to create beautiful, 3D graphics and animations that use the GPU to achieve maximal performance. This technology is called WebGL and is supported by the latest versions of Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Internet Explorer. With WebGL, you can create 3D scenes that run directly in your browser, without the need for any plugins. Support on the desktop for this standard is great, and most modern devices and mobile browsers fully support this standard.</p><p>To create WebGL applications, however, you need to learn a new language (called GLSL) and understand how vertex and fragment shaders can be used to render your 3D geometries. Luckily, though, there are a number of JavaScript libraries available that wrap the WebGL internals and provide a JavaScript API that you can use without having to understand the most complex features of WebGL. One of the most mature and feature-rich of those libraries is Three.js.</p><p>Three.js started in 2010 and provides a large number of easy-to-use APIs that expose all the features of Three.js and allows you to quickly create complex 3D scenes and animations in your browser.</p><p>Through its APIs, you can do pretty much everything that you want with Three.js. However, because it has so many features, it's sometimes difficult to find the right way to accomplish something. Throughout the years, Three.js has been under heavy development, but it is stabilizing now. So many examples and tutorials that you find online are outdated and don't work anymore. In this book, we'll provide you with a large number of recipes that you can follow to accomplish some common tasks with Three.js. Each example is accompanied with a runnable example that you can examine to better understand the recipe or adapt for your own purposes.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Getting Started">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Getting Started</em></span>, covers the basic recipes that you can use when you create new Three.js-based applications. We'll show you how you can set up a basic Three.js skeleton using any of the available Three.js renderers. We'll further show you WebGL detection, loading resources, setting up an animation loop, adding drag and drop support, and controlling your scene through the keyboard.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Geometries and Meshes">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Geometries and Meshes</em></span>, shows you a number of recipes that focus on creating, working with and manipulating geometries and meshes. We'll go into detail on how to rotate meshes in different ways, manipulate them using matrix transformations, generate geometries programmatically, and load models from Blender and in other formats.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Working with the Camera">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Working with the Camera</em></span>, focuses on recipes that manipulate the cameras available in Three.js. It shows you how to work with the perspective and the orthogonal camera. This chapter also shows you recipes that explain how to rotate a camera, center a camera, and follow objects around.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Materials and Textures">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Materials and Textures</em></span>, contains recipes that explain how to get good results working with the materials provided by Three.js. It has recipes on transparency, reflections, UV mapping, face materials, bump and normal maps and also explains how the various blend modes work.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Lights and Custom Shaders">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Lights and Custom Shaders</em></span>, has recipes that deal with the workings of the different light sources in Three.js and shows you how to work with WebGL shaders. It shows you how to correctly set up shadows, create a sun-like lighting source, and goes into the differences between spot lights, point lights, and directional lights. In this chapter, we'll also provide you with a couple of recipes that explain how to create a custom vertex shader and a custom fragment shader.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Point Clouds and Postprocessing">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Point Clouds and Postprocessing</em></span>, provides you with recipes that show you how to set up postprocessing. With postprocessing, you can enhance your scene with blurring, coloring, or other types of effects. This chapter also contains recipes that explain features of a particle system, such as animation and particle materials.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Animation and Physics">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Animation and Physics</em></span>, shows you a number of recipes that help you in animating the objects in your scene and show you how to add physics (such as gravity and collision detection) to your scene.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>The only thing that you need for this book is a simple text editor to experiment with the provided recipes and a modern web browser to run the examples. For some of the advanced recipes, it is preferred to have a locally installed web server or disable some security settings in your browser. In <a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Getting Started">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Getting Started</em></span>, recipes are provided that explain how to set up such a server and disable the relevant security settings.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is for everyone who has a basic understanding of JavaScript and Three.js but wants to learn how to use more advanced features of Three.js You don't need to understand advanced math concepts or have in depth knowledge of WebGL. The recipes in this book will explain the various features of Three.js step-by-step and we also provide all the recipes as ready to use HTML sources.</p></div>
