			<p><strong class="bold">Google Classroom</strong> is a <strong class="bold">learning management system</strong> (often abbreviated to <strong class="bold">LMS</strong>) offered by Google to teachers. It provides a central location to communicate with students, share resources, pose questions, and create assignments. In an increasingly digital world, Google Classroom helps facilitate online learning for today's digital learners. As with many new applications, Google Classroom comes with a unique look and feel. Since your method of setting up your physical classroom is as unique as your method of teaching, Google Classroom begins as a blank canvas. Before we can add students into Google Classroom, you will need to create online Classes for your physical classes.</p>
			<p>First, you will get comfortable with where everything is in Google Classroom. Being the teacher of the Classroom will provide access to options that are not visible to students and will allow you to change settings, such as what students can do in Google Classroom. You will be able to add students to the Classroom, create announcements and assignments, and upload course materials from this <em class="italic">teacher</em> view of the Classroom. But first, you will need to create and set up your first Class.</p>
			<p>In my Classes, I tend to spend most of my time thinking about the structure of the online Class before creating it. As creatures of habit, establishing online expectations through Google Classroom, similar to what we do in person, will help us and our students know where to turn. Examples of some of the questions I ask myself when planning an online Class include: <em class="italic">How do students ask questions?</em> <em class="italic">When is it appropriate for them to ask questions?</em> <em class="italic">Where do they find resources?</em> <em class="italic">How are they dismissed?</em> By establishing this structure at the beginning, you will feel less guilty about not responding when a student contacts you at 7:30 in the evening with a question.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Creating your first Google Class</li>
				<li>Navigating around Google Classroom</li>
				<li>Personalizing your virtual Classroom</li>
				<li>Managing resources in your Class</li>
				<li>Inviting additional teachers</li>
				<li>Accessing Classes from Google Classroom's home page<p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">Within this book, <strong class="bold">Class</strong> references a Google Classroom Class and <strong class="bold">class</strong> references a bricks-and-mortar classroom.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-15"><a id="_idTextAnchor014"/>Creating your first Google Class</h1>
			<p>To begin, open<a id="_idIndexMarker000"/> Google<a id="_idIndexMarker001"/> Chrome and navigate to <a href="https://classroom.google.com/h">https://classroom.google.com/h</a>.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Choosing the right internet browser</p>
			<p class="callout">While Google Classroom is accessible in any web browser, the Google Chrome web browser is built to be compatible with all of Google's other apps. Therefore, some features may be incompatible or will not function correctly in other web browsers. Consider discussing with your school IT staff if Google Chrome is not installed on your computer.</p>
			<p>If this is your first time opening Google Classroom using a <strong class="bold">Google Workspace for Education</strong> account, it will ask you to confirm your email account and then select whether to assign a <strong class="bold">teacher</strong> or <strong class="bold">student</strong> role to your account. Be sure to correctly select the teacher role, otherwise your account will be set up as a student account. You will not be able to create or manage Classes unless your role is a teacher in Google Classroom.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot depicts the teacher role being selected:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer012" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.1 – Selecting your role</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">If your account is set to a student account, you will need to contact your IT department so that they<a id="_idIndexMarker002"/> can change your Google Classroom role to a teacher role.</p>
			<p>Using a personal <strong class="source-inline">@gmail.com</strong> account or a <strong class="bold">Google Workspace for Business</strong> account will not have the <strong class="bold">Pick your role</strong> page. Instead, all users will be able to create Classes in Google Classroom. </p>
			<p>Another method of accessing Google Classroom is to use the app launcher. If the IT department has enabled this feature, click the waffle-shaped icon at the top-right corner of another Google app, such as <strong class="bold">Gmail</strong>, to see whether the <strong class="bold">Classroom</strong> icon is available.</p>
			<p>This is illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer013" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.2 – Classroom app in App Launcher</p>
			<p>Once you select<a id="_idIndexMarker003"/> the teacher role, the next page will point you toward a plus symbol <strong class="bold">+</strong> in the top-right corner to create your first Class, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer014" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.3 – Creating your first Class</p>
			<p>When you click on the <strong class="bold">+</strong> symbol, a menu will appear for you to select whether to create a Class or a join a Class. Click on <strong class="bold">Create class</strong> to create your first Class.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">As a teacher, you can join another teacher's Class as a student by clicking on <strong class="bold">Join class</strong> and filling in the Class code. These instructions are covered in detail in <a href="B16846_02_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor026"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Inviting Students to Their Virtual Classroom</em>.</p>
			<p>A dialog box will appear, for you to name the Class and provide a section number. While the <strong class="bold">Class name</strong> field is mandatory, the <strong class="bold">Section</strong> number, <strong class="bold">Subject</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Room</strong> fields are optional. Depending on your school policies, specific Classes may already have section numbers that you can add here.</p>
			<p>In Canada, many middle and high schools use section numbers for the timetable schedule, which is another option to fill in for this field. Since students will also see the section number, using the <strong class="bold">Timetable</strong> section number will be more applicable to them. While the <strong class="bold">Subject</strong> and <strong class="bold">Room</strong> fields can be helpful, these are not visible in Google Classroom by default.</p>
			<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker004"/>screenshot provides an overview of the Class information:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer015" class="IMG---Figure">

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.4 – Information for the Class in Google Classroom</p>
			<p>Once these fields are filled in and the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> button is clicked, you will be taken to your new Class in Google Classroom, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>

			<p>Now that the<a id="_idIndexMarker005"/> Class is created, in the next section you will explore the different features of this online Class. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-16"><a id="_idTextAnchor015"/>Navigating around Google Classroom</h1>
			<p>Now that your<a id="_idIndexMarker006"/> first Class is set up in Google Classroom, you can see its different parts—the banner, menu, sidebar, and content area, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer017" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_1.6_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 1.6 – Parts of a Google Classroom Class&#13;&#10;" width="992" height="625"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.6 – Parts of a Google Classroom Class</p>
			<p>Let's take a<a id="_idIndexMarker007"/> look at each of these parts, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The banner displays a banner image, class name, section, <strong class="bold">Class code</strong>, and the Google <strong class="bold">Meet link</strong> functionality. The banner is the first thing students see when they enter the Classroom and this allows them to quickly identify which Class they are accessing in Google Classroom. The students' view is slightly different—the <strong class="bold">Class code</strong> field and the link to change the theme are missing.</li>
				<li>The menu allows teachers and students to switch between the different sections of Google Classroom. The menu has the following sub-sections:<p>The <strong class="bold">Stream</strong> section is where announcements, notifications for new assignments, discussion questions, and materials from the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> section appear. How to create an announcement within this section is elaborated upon in <a href="B16846_03_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor040"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Sending Your First Announcement</em>.</p><p>The <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> section is where resources, questions such as polls, and assignments are found. Information on organizing and implementing features within this section can be found in <a href="B16846_04_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor055"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Starting an Online Discussion with Questions</em>, and <a href="B16846_05_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor066"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Handing out and Taking in Assignments</em>.</p><p>The <strong class="bold">People</strong> section displays a list of all teachers managing and all students enrolled in the Class. Teachers can email students from this section and change student-related settings in Google Classroom. The features of this section are elaborated upon in <a href="B16846_02_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor026"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Inviting Students to Their Virtual Classroom</em>.</p><p>The <strong class="bold">Grades</strong> section displays the grades for questions and assignments found in the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> section. This page organizes all questions and assignment grades into a table for easy viewing. The features of this section are found in <a href="B16846_06_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor079"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Grading Written Assignments in a Flash</em>.</p></li>
				<li>The sidebar displays upcoming assignments when in the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong> section and a <strong class="bold">Topics</strong> list<a id="_idIndexMarker008"/> when in the <strong class="bold">Classwork </strong>section.</li>
				<li>The content area displays the current section in the Class.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that we are familiar with creating the main features of Google Classroom, it's now time to setup the Class and start adding content.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-17"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"/>Personalizing your virtual Classroom</h1>
			<p>Similar to how <a id="_idIndexMarker009"/>teachers have a couple of days before students arrive at school to prepare for their classroom, you want to take some time to add information to your online Classroom before students are invited. These are the tasks you can perform in Google Classroom:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Changing the Classroom's theme</li>
				<li>Uploading a banner image</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/>Changing the Classroom's theme</h2>
			<p>The Classroom <a id="_idIndexMarker010"/>banner is the most prominent part of your Class. It creates an atmosphere for students when they arrive. Google Classroom will automatically apply a theme that is appropriate to the Class name for common subjects. This is why the theme banner has laboratory equipment for the <strong class="bold">Science</strong> class created in the previous section.</p>
			<p>The theme also changes the colors of the headings and icons throughout the Classroom. To change your Classroom's theme, follow these steps:</p>
			<p>Click on <strong class="bold">Select theme</strong> at the bottom-right corner of the banner image, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer018" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_1.7_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 1.7 – Select theme link&#13;&#10;" width="788" height="86"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.7 – Select theme link</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Select the<a id="_idIndexMarker011"/> desired Google Classroom-provided banner image. The colors within the Classroom will change to match the banner. Click the <strong class="bold">Select class theme</strong> button, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer019" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_1.8_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 1.8 – Theme Gallery&#13;&#10;" width="1233" height="702"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.8 – Theme Gallery</p>
			<p>Here is your Class with the new theme:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer020" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_1.9_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 1.9 – Heading colors change to match the theme&#13;&#10;" width="887" height="559"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.9 – Heading colors change to match the theme</p>
			<p>Google Classroom also offers several categories to help find the banner appropriate for your Class. Simply<a id="_idIndexMarker012"/> select a tab in the dialog box to view available banners within each category, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer021" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_1.10_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 1.10 – Categories in the Theme Gallery&#13;&#10;" width="686" height="148"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.10 – Categories in the Theme Gallery</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Try different themes</p>
			<p class="callout">If this is your first foray into Google Classroom, try different themes before choosing one for the Class. The most prominent colors in the banner image will suggest which colors the theme will <a id="_idIndexMarker013"/>use for the background and the menu.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/>Uploading a banner image</h2>
			<p>Another <a id="_idIndexMarker014"/>alternative to using the images found within Google Classroom is to upload your own picture. The following steps will guide you through uploading a banner image:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Click on <strong class="bold">Upload photo</strong> at the bottom-right corner of the banner image, as illustrated in the following screenshot:<div id="_idContainer022" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_1.11_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 1.11 – Upload photo link&#13;&#10;" width="727" height="120"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.11 – Upload photo link</p></li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Select a photo from your computer</strong> button, as illustrated in the following screenshot:<div id="_idContainer023" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_1.12_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 1.12 – Upload photo dialog box&#13;&#10;" width="366" height="289"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.12 – Upload photo dialog box</p></li>
				<li>In File Explorer, select the desired image and click the <strong class="bold">Open</strong> button, as illustrated in the following screenshot:<div id="_idContainer024" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_1.13_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 1.13 – Selecting an image in File Explorer&#13;&#10;" width="753" height="469"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.13 – Selecting an image in File Explorer</p></li>
				<li>If the <a id="_idIndexMarker015"/>image is too large, crop it by resizing the frame and move it to the desired location on the image. Then, click the <strong class="bold">Select class theme</strong> button, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer025" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_1.14_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 1.14 – Cropping an image&#13;&#10;" width="389" height="270"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.14 – Cropping an image</p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows how the Class looks after uploading the image in the previous steps:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer026" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_1.15_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 1.15 – Screenshot of a custom image theme&#13;&#10;" width="1031" height="623"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.15 – Screenshot of a custom image theme</p>
			<p>The accent color <a id="_idIndexMarker016"/>for the Class web page changes to match the banner color. The color is shown throughout the Class in links, headings, and icons. At the time of writing, there is no way to customize this accent color.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Choosing the right image</p>
			<p class="callout">Size matters when it comes to your banner image. Google Classroom will only use images with a pixel dimension of at least 800 x 200. The text on the banner will always remain white. Lighter-colored images, such as the one in the previous example, will be darkened to ensure the legibility of the text.</p>
			<p>Once you have chosen the appropriate theme to personalize your Google Class, you can now start adding resources.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/>Managing resources in your Class</h1>
			<p>Students and co-teachers<a id="_idIndexMarker017"/> will be able to find links to other Google apps associated with Google Classroom and resources related to the Classroom in the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> section of the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong> section. To navigate to this section, click on the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> tab in the menu, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer027" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_1.16_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 1.16 – Classwork tab&#13;&#10;" width="500" height="87"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.16 – Classwork tab</p>
			<p>With your newly created site, the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> tab will be blank. At the top of the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> section, there are icons and links to other Google apps that are associated with this Class, as <a id="_idIndexMarker018"/>shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer028" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_1.17_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 1.17 – Links to Google apps linked to the Class&#13;&#10;" width="689" height="263"/>

			<p>This section is where you distribute files, ask questions, and assign assignments. Many of these features are explored in later chapters. In this section, you will create a topic and add files to the topic. If you already have a course syllabus and other files in a digital format, filling in this section can be made easy by adding those files to this section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>Adding files and resources to your Classroom</h2>
			<p>There are<a id="_idIndexMarker019"/> two areas where you can add files to <a id="_idIndexMarker020"/>Google Classroom—the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong> section and the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> section. Files uploaded to the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong> section are for short-term uses, such as announcements or worksheets, whereas files uploaded to the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> section are relevant for the duration of the course, such as a course syllabus. Because students will access these files for the duration of the course, adding topics in an organized fashion will help them find material more easily.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">While you don't have to create a topic to add files and other materials to the <strong class="bold">Classwork </strong>section, students will use the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> section more frequently if they can easily find the files they are looking for. </p>
			<h3>Creating a topic in Classwork</h3>
			<p>To create a topic, use the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Click on the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> button and then select <strong class="bold">Topic</strong>, as illustrated in the following screenshot:<p class="figure-caption"> </p><div id="_idContainer029" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_1.18_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 1.18 – The Topic option in the Create menu&#13;&#10;" width="248" height="491"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.18 – The Topic option in the Create menu</p></li>
				<li>A dialog <a id="_idIndexMarker021"/>box will appear. Enter the <strong class="bold">Topic</strong> name<a id="_idIndexMarker022"/> and click the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> button, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</li>

			<h3>Adding a file from Google Drive</h3>
			<p>Files can<a id="_idIndexMarker025"/> be added from Google <a id="_idIndexMarker026"/>Drive or uploaded from your computer. Furthermore, you can also link videos from YouTube and link websites. In this section, you will add a file from Google Drive to the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> section, as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> section, click on the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> button, then select <strong class="bold">Material</strong>, as illustrated in the following screenshot:<div id="_idContainer032" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_1.21_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 1.21 – The Material field in the Create menu&#13;&#10;" width="228" height="267"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.21 – The Material field in the Create menu</p></li>

			<h3>Adding a file from your computer</h3>
			<p>If you do not <a id="_idIndexMarker033"/>use Google Drive regularly or still <a id="_idIndexMarker034"/>have many files on your computer, the steps to upload files directly from your computer are similar to those for adding a file from Google Drive. These steps are listed here:</p>

			<p>It is currently not possible to easily add Google Drive folders to Google Classroom. A simple workaround is to use the <strong class="bold">Get link</strong> share feature of Google Drive and add it as a link in<a id="_idIndexMarker039"/> Classroom. This feature is illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<p class="figure-caption">  </p>

			<p>After adding<a id="_idIndexMarker040"/> materials<a id="_idIndexMarker041"/> to your Classroom, you may decide to rearrange their order.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>Reordering materials in your Classroom</h2>
			<p>To change the <a id="_idIndexMarker042"/>order of materials in your Classroom, drag and drop the material (and other post types) to the desired order using the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Hover the mouse over the material to be moved, as illustrated in the following screenshot:<div id="_idContainer044" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_1.33_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 1.33 – Hovering the mouse over a post&#13;&#10;" width="454" height="164"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.33 – Hovering the mouse over a post</p></li>
				<li>Click and drag the material to the desired position. The material post will shrink to a small rectangle. Other posts will move to make space as you drag the post around, as illustrated in the following screenshot:<div id="_idContainer045" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_1.34_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 1.34 – Clicking and dragging a post&#13;&#10;" width="663" height="165"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.34 – Clicking and dragging a post</p></li>
				<li>Releasing <a id="_idIndexMarker043"/>the mouse button will expand the selected post to its original size.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>Storing files in your Classroom</h2>
			<p>Whenever you<a id="_idIndexMarker044"/> upload files to Google Classroom, the files are stored in Google Drive. Files uploaded within a post, such as materials, are saved to Google Drive's default folder, <strong class="bold">My Drive</strong>. Moving or renaming a file in Google Drive will not affect Google Classroom's link to the file. When students begin submitting files for assignments, they will be accessible in the <strong class="bold">Class Drive folder</strong> functionality. An icon and link to the folder can be found in the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> section, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer046" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_1.35_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 1.35 – Class Drive folder hyperlink in the Classwork tab&#13;&#10;" width="375" height="47"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.35 – Class Drive folder hyperlink in the Classwork tab</p>
			<p>Uploaded files will appear in the Google Drive app, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer047" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_1.36_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 1.36 – Screenshot of files uploaded to Google Drive&#13;&#10;" width="857" height="579"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.36 – Screenshot of files uploaded to Google Drive</p>
			<p>These files can be further organized into folders within the Google Drive app. Then, in subsequent Classes, you can add files to your Class directly from Google Drive. Having files organized in Google Drive will also help share resources with other teachers who teach the same <a id="_idIndexMarker045"/>subject. In fact, when sharing my resources with other teachers, I often share the <strong class="bold">Google Drive</strong> folder and invite them to relevant Classes in Google Classroom.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>Inviting additional teachers</h1>
			<p>You might share <a id="_idIndexMarker046"/>teaching responsibilities with colleagues who also need access to the Class on Google Classroom. By inviting other teachers, those teachers will be able to do anything that you can do, except <em class="italic">delete the Classroom</em>.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Be sure that whoever you invite as a co-teacher is proficient with Google Classroom because they can change and delete content, and there is <strong class="bold">no</strong> recorded history of what they do.</p>
			<p>To invite another teacher to your Classroom, proceed as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In the <strong class="bold">People</strong> section, click on the <strong class="bold">Invite teachers</strong> icon in the <strong class="bold">Teachers</strong> heading, as illustrated in the following screenshot:<div id="_idContainer048" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_1.37_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 1.37 – Icon to add a co-teacher&#13;&#10;" width="715" height="134"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.37 – Icon to add a co-teacher</p></li>
				<li>Search for the teacher using their name or email address. Select the account and then click <a id="_idIndexMarker047"/>the <strong class="bold">Invite</strong> button, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ol>

			<p>Now that your first Class is ready to go, you can apply the techniques in this chapter to create additional Classes as needed. If you teach primary students, colleagues often create classes for<a id="_idIndexMarker048"/> specific subjects; if you teach secondary students, each class usually has its own Class in Google Classroom.</p>
			<p>Often, extra-curriculars such as clubs or athletics groups will use Classes in Google Classroom to communicate with students. Therefore, viewing and managing all your Classes in Google Classroom is essential.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-25"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>Accessing Classes from Google Classroom's home page</h1>
			<p>Google Classroom's home <a id="_idIndexMarker049"/>page displays all classes in which you are a teacher or a student. The classes are arranged like cards on the page. The next time you go to Google Classroom, you will first arrive at the home page where you can select the desired class, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer051" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_1.40_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 1.40 – Classroom Class dashboard&#13;&#10;" width="1085" height="368"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.40 – Classroom Class dashboard</p>
			<p>Classes in <a id="_idIndexMarker050"/>which you are enrolled as a student will have an image of the teacher on the Class card.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">To rearrange Classes on the home page, drag and drop the Class cards.</p>
			<p>When you are in a Classroom, you can switch to a different Class by clicking on the hamburger menu icon at the top-left corner of the banner, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer052" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_1.41_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 1.41 – Hamburger menu&#13;&#10;" width="196" height="149"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.41 – Hamburger menu</p>
			<p>The menu will appear and you can select the desired Class from it, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer053" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_1.42_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 1.42 – Sections of the dashboard menu&#13;&#10;" width="665" height="693"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.42 – Sections of the dashboard menu</p>
			<p>The menu is<a id="_idIndexMarker051"/> separated into Classes that you are teaching and Classes in which you are enrolled as a student. In addition, you can return to the Google Classroom home page, view the Google Classroom calendar, access archived Classes, and change the settings from this menu.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-26"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>You have now created your first Class and personalized it before adding students to the Class. You then added information and materials to the Class, as well as inviting a co-teacher.</p>
			<p>After creating a Class, you changed the theme of the Classroom by using the various themes and patterns in Google Classroom. In addition, you uploaded a new image to use as a theme.</p>
			<p>Then, you added the Class resources to the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> section, where you uploaded files from Google Drive and your computer. Finally, you invited another teacher to the Class.</p>
			<p>Now that the Class is all set up, it's time to invite the students. In the next chapter, we will learn what it takes for students to access Google Classroom, as well as how to invite students to your Classroom.</p>
