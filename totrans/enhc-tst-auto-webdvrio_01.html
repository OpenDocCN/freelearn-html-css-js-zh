			<h1 id="_idParaDest-16"><a id="_idTextAnchor015"/>The Utility Belt – Tools Every Superhero SDET Needs</h1>
			<p>This is not your ordinary technical manual, which can be dry and boring. This book is intended to be fun. That’s why many of the chapters share a comic book theme. But unlike some superheroes, you won’t need to be bitten by a radioactive arachnid to get these powers. We just need some tools to create a great framework using WebdriverIO <span class="No-Break">in TypeScript.</span></p>
			<p>If you are just beginning your journey as a <strong class="bold">software developer engineer in test</strong> (<strong class="bold">SDET</strong>), you might be tempted to just skip ahead, install the TypeScript coding environment, run your first test, and hopefully see a <strong class="bold">Pass</strong> result. I’ve done that myself, only to realize later there were some tools I missed that could have helped make the journey easier from the start. That is why this first chapter speaks to the system specifications, tools, and configurations that will help us write better code from <span class="No-Break">day one.</span></p>
			<p>Along the way, I’ll be providing tips and tricks from more than 20 years as an SDET. There will be rules of thumb and advanced techniques. These are designed to help you write more tests, debug more efficiently, and produce a testing framework that will be stable, scalable, and require far less <span class="No-Break">code maintenance.</span></p>
			<p>The main topics covered in this <span class="No-Break">chapter are:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Virgin <span class="No-Break">machine setup</span></li>
				<li>Installing Visual Studio Code for your <span class="No-Break">operating system</span></li>
				<li>Writing better code with Prettier, ESLint, <span class="No-Break">and GitLens</span></li>
				<li>Installing <span class="No-Break">Chrome extensions</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Installing WebdriverIO</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-17"><a id="_idTextAnchor016"/>Virgin machine setup</h1>
			<p>Before you can do anything in the <a id="_idIndexMarker000"/>world of test automation on a virgin machine, you must install some packages, so you will need admin rights to the machine. So, before going any further, please ensure you have the following packages installed globally with their most <span class="No-Break">stable version:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break">NodeJS</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Yarn</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Java JDK</span></li>
				<li>An <strong class="bold">integrated development environment</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDE</strong>) (IntelliJ, VSCode, and <span class="No-Break">so on)</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Git</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Here are some extra steps if you are using a <span class="No-Break">Windows machine:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Set up the PATH environment for <span class="No-Break">your node</span></li>
				<li>Reboot the machine for all the changes to <span class="No-Break">take effect</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Before we get to running our first test, we need to check out system requirements and get our tools. In this chapter, we’re going to cover how to install and configure tools that will make our job easier, <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Hardware specifications</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Node.js</strong></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">A GitHub account</strong> and <strong class="bold">GitHub Desktop</strong> for code <span class="No-Break">change management</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Microsoft Visual </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Studio Code</strong></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Prettier</strong>, <strong class="bold">GitLens</strong>, and <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">ESLint extensions</strong></span></li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">SelectorsHub</strong> and <strong class="bold">EditThisCookie</strong> <span class="No-Break">Chrome extensions</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Note that to install these tools, you will need local admin rights or know someone in your IT security department who has the rights and can install them for you. Without local admin rights, you won’t get far. You should<a id="_idTextAnchor017"/> have the same rights as the product development team, whose <a id="_idIndexMarker001"/>applications you will <span class="No-Break">be testing.</span></p>
			<p>This brings us to our first rule <span class="No-Break">of thumb.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/>Rule of thumb – the hardware resources and access rights must match the development team</h1>
			<p>Throughout this book, I will be bringing up some rules of thumb that I use to keep us on the path<a id="_idIndexMarker002"/> and out of the <span class="No-Break">thorn</span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker003"/></span><span class="No-Break"> bushes.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s talk about why this is importa<a id="_idTextAnchor019"/><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>nt. Upfront, you can assess if your automation project will succeed just by considering if you can install Chrome extensions. If your corporate IT security department prevents the installation of any browser extensions, your automation progress will be severely hindered. We all want to have a successful test automation project. We do not want to start our journey hamstrung. <em class="italic">Test automation is code development; it requires developer tools, and you are a developer.</em> Do not let anyone tell <span class="No-Break">you differently.</span></p>
			<p>If your employer or client sees your project as just record and playback, you are at risk of having a project that is doomed to fail from the start. The biggest red flag that this is the case is that your computer resources and access do not match that of <span class="No-Break">your developers.</span></p>
			<p><em class="italic">Question: What are the technical spec requirements for my WebdriverIO test </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">automation system?</em></span></p>
			<p>The answer<a id="_idIndexMarker004"/> is a simple <em class="italic">Do</em> and <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Do not</em></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>
			<p><em class="italic">Do not</em> use<a id="_idTextAnchor021"/> the minimum requirem<a id="_idTextAnchor022"/>ents listed anywhere on the internet. Whatever it is, it is <span class="No-Break">too small.</span></p>
			<p><em class="italic">Do</em> match the CPU speed, the amount of RAM, the drive space, and the number of monitors<a id="_idIndexMarker005"/> <span class="No-Break">on desks.</span></p>
			<p>This includes matching the version of the Mac or Windows operating system used by the development team. Windows should be 64-bit and probably the <span class="No-Break">Professional edition.</span></p>
			<p>It also includes the local admin rights of your application developers. This allows you to install browser extensions that will save your team time. This means you might have to propose a business case to meet <span class="No-Break">this requirement.</span></p>
			<p>It is simple, really: without these tools, you will spend time trying to write locators by hand and taking extra steps to clear cookies. The project will go slower, and the company will pay more for fewer tests in the same amount of time. In extreme cases, you may have to walk away from a project and find a new employer who is ready to take QA testing seriously. The only exception is if your application developers are using Eclipse, which is not recommended for professional-level <span class="No-Break">code development.</span></p>
			<p>That said, let’s begin by installing the tools for WebdriverIO so that we’re heading in the <span class="No-Break">right direction.</span></p>
			<p>We will start by emulating two heroes<a id="_idIndexMarker006"/> who have unlimited wealth<a id="_idIndexMarker007"/> and brilliant minds. To be effective at fighting crime, one has a utility belt with multiple tools and the other a metal suit with AI intelligence <a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>to help bring villains—or, in our case, bugs—to <span class="No-Break">justice faster.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>Installing Node.js and npm</h2>
			<p>Node.js is an open source, cross-platform<a id="_idIndexMarker008"/> runtime environment and an asynchronous<a id="_idIndexMarker009"/> library that is used for running web applications outside the client’s browser. This project was created with Node version 16.13.0 for several reasons. Earlier versions were only required to support synchronous mode, which was deprecated in WebDriverIO 7.0 and removed in version 8.0. While the latest version of Node as of this writing is 19.8.1, it is recommended to use 16.13.0 as it is the most compatible with most other modules <span class="No-Break">and packages.</span></p>
			<p>Make sure you have enough hard drive space for the installation. It will take a minimum of 3 GB to install. By default, these tools are installed on the <strong class="source-inline">C:</strong> drive. If your drive is nearing capacity, consider installing it on a larger <span class="No-Break">drive partition.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s begin by installing Node and npm. The following<a id="_idIndexMarker010"/> screenshot shows how<a id="_idIndexMarker011"/> you can <span class="No-Break">do this:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer007" class="IMG---Figure">

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.1 – Downloading Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/</p>
			<p>For Mac, install the latest <strong class="source-inline">.</strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">pkg</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> file.</span></p>
			<p>For Windows, download the <span class="No-Break">64-bit version.</span></p>
			<p>The version<a id="_idIndexMarker012"/> of Node.js to install will be <strong class="bold">long-term support</strong> (<strong class="bold">LTS</strong>), which is version 18.0 as of this writing. Note that WebdriverIO deprecated the <strong class="source-inline">@wdio/sync</strong> <em class="italic">synchronous mode</em>, which is supported and stable only through Node.js version 12.0. This book will use asynchronous command execution with the <strong class="source-inline">async()</strong> and <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">await()</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> commands.</span></p>
			<p>The installation will also install <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Chocolatey</strong> for Windows or <strong class="bold">Brew</strong> for Mac, a package <span class="No-Break">installation tool</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Python</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Node.js</strong></span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">npm</strong></span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Required </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">system updates</strong></span></li>
			</ul>
			<p class="callout-heading">Reminder</p>
			<p class="callout">These all will require admin rights to <span class="No-Break">complete successfully.</span></p>
			<p>Once completed, check whether the Node.js and Chocolatey paths have been added to the system’s <strong class="source-inline">PATH</strong> environment variables, as illustrated in the following screenshot. If not, they must be <span class="No-Break">added manually:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer008" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.2 – Node.js and Chocolatey paths in the PATH environment variable for Windows</p>
			<p>For both Mac and Windows, we will install a version of Node that is at least version 18.0. From the command shell, type these <span class="No-Break">two commands:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
&gt; nvm install 18
Downloading node.js version 18.17.1 (64-bit)...
&gt; nvm use 18
Now using node v18.17.1 (64-bit)</pre>			<p>While this completes the Node installation, we need to take note of alternative package managers that offer <span class="No-Break">additional options.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/>Alternate node package managers – Yarn versus npm</h2>
			<p>While npm is the default node package manager provided, we recommend using Yarn to both install packages and run programs. One major advantage of Yarn is that it installs packages in parallel. This reduces the <a id="_idIndexMarker013"/>build time significantly when initializing or refreshing the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">package.json</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> file.</span></p>
			<p>Again, from the command <a id="_idIndexMarker014"/>shell type <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
&gt; npm install --global yarn</pre>			<p>After installing Yarn, you can verify the installation by running the <span class="No-Break">following command:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
&gt; yarn --version
1.19.22</pre>			<p>With that complete, we will now decide where our project <span class="No-Break">will live.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"/>Configuring the coding environment with GitHub Desktop</h2>
			<p>In upcoming chapters, we will dive deeper<a id="_idIndexMarker015"/> into Git and GitHub<a id="_idIndexMarker016"/> for code versioning. But it is good to plan, so we will create a Git folder structure for <span class="No-Break">our projects.</span></p>
			<p>Our <strong class="source-inline">wdio</strong> project workspace will live in a Git <strong class="bold">repository</strong> (<strong class="bold">repo</strong>) folder that holds your projects at the root of your largest drive, preferably not the Windows <strong class="source-inline">C:</strong> drive. The reason is that Node.js projects rely on many supporting packages. These will take up a significant amount of additional space in the <strong class="source-inline">node_modules</strong> folder. At some point, the drive will be filled, <span class="No-Break">affecting responsiveness.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s begin by creating a <strong class="source-inline">\repos</strong> folder at the root of our drive, or on the desktop on Mac, to hold <span class="No-Break">our projects:</span></p>
			<p class="IMG---Figure"><img src="image/B19395_Figure_1.3.png" alt="Figure 1.3 – Sample repository and project directory structure"/></p>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.3 – Sample repository and project directory structure</p>
			<p>Our project will live<a id="_idIndexMarker017"/> inside a local repository<a id="_idIndexMarker018"/> named <strong class="source-inline">\wdio</strong>. This is where we will create<a id="_idIndexMarker019"/> a place where our files will be<a id="_idIndexMarker020"/> stored. Later, we will use <a id="_idIndexMarker021"/>code repositories for version control, such as <strong class="bold">GitHub</strong>, <strong class="bold">GitLab</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Bitbucket</strong>. For this book, we will use GitHub, and GitHub Desktop will be our <span class="No-Break">code-commit tool.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"/>GitHub and the GitHub Desktop tool</h2>
			<p>One tool all developers<a id="_idIndexMarker022"/> require is code version<a id="_idIndexMarker023"/> control. It will be a requirement for any team you join, and they will expect you to know Git commands. Learning the syntax and commands can pose a challenge for new coders. Mistakes typed at the Command Prompt can occur at any point, and knowing how to resolve these issues can be a <span class="No-Break">bigger challenge.</span></p>
			<p>However, there is an easier approach that will make life better. Using the <strong class="bold">GitHub Desktop</strong> tool for code commits gives a visual insight into code changes. You can examine the Git commands<a id="_idIndexMarker024"/> it uses to learn to use the<a id="_idIndexMarker025"/> Terminal window with <span class="No-Break">fewer errors.</span></p>
			<p>First, we need a <span class="No-Break">GitHub account.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/>Getti<a href="http://www.github.com">ng a GitHub ac</a>count</h2>
			<p>Go to <a href="http://www.github.com">www.github.com</a> and click <strong class="bold">Sign up</strong>. Enter an<a id="_idIndexMarker026"/> email, a password, and a username, and verify <span class="No-Break">your account.</span></p>
			<p>During the account setup process, select the <strong class="bold">Automation and CI/CD</strong> option. This configures the project for executions that can be triggered automatically at certain times of the day <span class="No-Break">or week:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer010" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.4 – Automation and CI/CD configuration</p>
			<p>We now have a free public GitHub account to practice commits and version control. Now, go to your GitHub page and create a <strong class="source-inline">wdio</strong> repository with a README file. Note that free GitHub accounts are<a id="_idIndexMarker027"/> public. When working in a professional capacity, it is always best that you or your employer acquire a paid plan to make the <span class="No-Break">repository private:</span></p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.5 – Initializing the wdio project repository with a README file from GitHub</p>
			<p>We now have our GitHub account<a id="_idIndexMarker028"/> dashboard. It gives suggestions for additional tools <span class="No-Break">to install:</span></p>
			<p class="IMG---Figure"> </p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.6 – Links in GitHub to install GitHub Desktop and Visual Studio Code</p>
			<p>From here, we will add GitHub Desktop<a id="_idIndexMarker029"/> and the Visual Studio Code IDE. First, we’ll install <span class="No-Break">GitHub Desktop.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-24"><a id="_idTextAnchor029"/>Installing GitHub Desktop<a href="https://desktop.github.com/"/></h2>
			<p><a href="https://desktop.github.com/">Download<span id="_idIndexMarker030"/> GitHub Desktop<span id="_idIndexMarker031"/> </a><span class="No-Break">from </span><a href="https://desktop.github.com/"><span class="No-Break">https://desktop.github.com/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>The installation of GitHub Desktop is very straightforward. Simply download the installer for your operating system and launch it. Once the process is complete, GitHub Desktop <span class="No-Break">will launch:</span></p>
			<div>

			<p>If you have ever seen a beginner’s command-line video for Git, learning all the arcane commands may send a shiver down your spine. It might spark fear that the team project could be broken if your changes are committed without pulling changes from other team members first. That is why a GUI for beginners is a better choice over a printed Git cheat sheet – it prevents mistakes while learning Git commands. Here’s <span class="No-Break">an example:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer014" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19395_Figure_1.8.jpg" alt="Figure 1.8 – GitHub Desktop showing pending changes that should be pulled before a commit action"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.8 – GitHub Desktop showing pending changes that should be pulled before a commit action</p>
			<p>A tool with a graphical interface<a id="_idIndexMarker032"/> is recommended for both speed and accuracy over the command-line interface. In the preceding example, we know we are in the <strong class="source-inline">main</strong> branch of the <strong class="source-inline">webdriverio</strong> repo with changes committed to the project from other team members, and a large blue <strong class="bold">Pull origin</strong> button reminds us to pull in the changes other team members have committed first. Skipping this step can revert the code changes, <span class="No-Break">causing trouble.</span></p>
			<p>GitHub Desktop’s <strong class="bold">History</strong> view supplies descriptions of those recent commits. It tells us which files were changed and the differences between the old and new lines <span class="No-Break">of code:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer015" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19395_Figure_1.9.jpg" alt="Figure 1.9 – GitHub Desktop’s History view showing old and new code changes"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.9 – GitHub Desktop’s History view showing old and new code changes</p>
			<p>Performing a code commit with a single click of a button is faster than typing into a Terminal window. We will link<a id="_idIndexMarker033"/> our project shortly. Next, we’ll install our coding <span class="No-Break">environment tool.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-25"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"/>Choosing your TypeScript development environment – Microsoft Visual Studio Code versus JetBrains Aqua</h2>
			<p>In this journey of developing a robust framework, we need to make many decisions, and one of those is which IDE will be used to write and run our code. My personal preference would be to use Visual Studio Code because it is easier to code on <span class="No-Break">multiple views.</span></p>
			<p>However, as of this writing, JetBrains Aqua only supports breakpoints when a script is launched from a configuration. It does not pause at breakpoints when a test script is launched from the embedded Terminal window. This is the way we will run our WebdriverIO scripts. Visual Studio Code will be the tool of choice for these projects since it is open source, but I still recommend that you try JetBrains Aqua for its superior code <span class="No-Break">interface design.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Microsoft Visual Studio Code</strong> is the free IDE for this book and has a strong company backing it up. However, many free tools lack an income stream to support either a development team or a product support team. Free tools can be years behind paid tools in functionality. Take, for example, Selenium, which<a id="_idIndexMarker034"/> introduced relative element location<a id="_idIndexMarker035"/> in version 4.0, which was released in May 2019. The same feature<a id="_idIndexMarker036"/> was part<a id="_idIndexMarker037"/> of most paid toolsets, including Micro Focus <strong class="bold">Unified Functional Testing</strong> (<strong class="bold">UFT</strong>), which goes as far back <span class="No-Break">as 2010.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-26"><a id="_idTextAnchor031"/>Installing Visual Studio Code for your operating sy<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">stem</a></h1>
			<p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Download<span id="_idIndexMarker038"/> Visual Studio Code <span class="No-Break">from</span></a><span class="No-Break"> </span><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download"><span class="No-Break">https://code.visualstudio.com/download</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Follow the installation<a id="_idIndexMarker039"/> process for your operating system. Again, the recommendation<a id="_idIndexMarker040"/> is to have these tools installed on a larger drive above the <strong class="source-inline">\</strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">repos</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> directory.</span></p>
			<p>Now that Visual Studio has been installed, we can check that Node and npm have been installed from the embedded Terminal <span class="No-Break">shell window.</span></p>
			<p>From the main menu, select <strong class="bold">Terminal </strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">New Terminal</strong> and press <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">Shift</em> for Windows and  <em class="italic">^</em> + <em class="italic">Shift</em> + <em class="italic">`</em> <span class="No-Break">for Mac.</span></p>
			<p>The Terminal shell<a id="_idIndexMarker041"/> for launching tests is up to your personal choice. <strong class="bold">PowerShell</strong> is recommended for Windows users, <strong class="bold">ZSH</strong> is recommended for Mac<a id="_idIndexMarker042"/> users, and <strong class="bold">Git Bash</strong> is great for command-line Git<a id="_idIndexMarker043"/> users. But<a id="_idIndexMarker044"/> for debugging, <strong class="bold">JavaScript Debug Terminal</strong> is required on <span class="No-Break">both platforms.</span></p>
			<p>From the Terminal window, click the <strong class="bold">v</strong> down arrow next to the <strong class="bold">+</strong> button in the lower-right corner, select <strong class="bold">JavaScript Debug Terminal</strong>, and type <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
<strong class="source-inline">node –v</strong>
<strong class="source-inline">npm -v</strong></pre>			<p>The system will respond with the versions of Node and npm you <span class="No-Break">have installed:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.10 – Checking the Node and npm versions you have installed from the embedded Terminal shell in Visual Studio Code</p>
			<p>Note that JavaScript Debug Terminal will run slower than the PowerShell or Bash shells, so it’s best to only use it when<a id="_idIndexMarker045"/> we need to stop at a breakpoint for debugging. Next, we will initialize our project<a id="_idIndexMarker046"/> from Visual <span class="No-Break">Studio Code.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-27"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"/>Initializing the Node project</h2>
			<p>Now that we have installed Visual Studio Code<a id="_idIndexMarker047"/> and created our project workspace directory, we can check that Node has been installed and initialize our project.

			<pre class="source-code">

			<p>This file keeps track of all the supporting Node packages that WebdriverIO uses to build and <span class="No-Break">automate tests.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we have our first project file, next, we will configure our editor settings to make coding <span class="No-Break">less error-prone.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-28"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>Configuring Visual Studio Code</h2>
			<p>The first change<a id="_idIndexMarker048"/> is when Visual Studio Code will save files. By default, implicit saves do not occur when changing from the code window to the Terminal. Since our tests will be launched from the Terminal, we want to ensure the latest version of the code is executed. Here’s how we can <span class="No-Break">configure this:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer018" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.12 – Setting Visual Studio Code to save files when the focus changes to the Terminal window</p>
			<p>Go to <strong class="bold">File</strong> | <strong class="bold">Preferences</strong> | <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> and type <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">auto save</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>Change the setting from <strong class="bold">afterDelay</strong> <span class="No-Break">to </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">onWindowChange</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>This will ensure code is saved when switching from the code console to the Terminal console. This avoids a common<a id="_idIndexMarker049"/> issue where the code is updated, but the results that are shown were executed with the <span class="No-Break">unchanged code.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>X-ray vision – writing better code with Prettier, ESLint, and GitLens</h1>
			<p>Developers need coding tools that help them<a id="_idIndexMarker050"/> efficiently write code<a id="_idIndexMarker051"/> that is formatted<a id="_idIndexMarker052"/> correctly, follow good coding<a id="_idIndexMarker053"/> practices, and know when team<a id="_idIndexMarker054"/> members make<a id="_idIndexMarker055"/> code changes. This is where Visual Studio Code extensions such as Prettier, ESLint, and GitLens become invaluable. Let’s install <span class="No-Break">these tools.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"/>Installing Visual Studio Code add-ons – Prettier</h2>
			<p>From<a id="_idIndexMarker056"/> the <strong class="bold">Extensions</strong> icon, add<a id="_idIndexMarker057"/> the <strong class="bold">Prettier  Code </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">formatter</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> extension:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.13 – Extensions can be accessed by clicking the cubes icon</p>
			<p>Prettier will automatically format code without taking extra time to type tabs manually. In this example, the code to the left is unformatted. We can now invoke Prettier by right-clicking the code and selecting <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Format Document</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span></p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.14 – Example of unformatted code before Prettier</p>
			<p>The code is then reformatted in a structured manner. Note that the square brackets and curly braces are tabbed out, and extra lines are <span class="No-Break">included automatically:</span></p>
			<div>

			<p>The code is now formatted<a id="_idIndexMarker058"/> for readability. The next extension <a id="_idIndexMarker059"/>will help us when working on a <span class="No-Break">GitHub team.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-31"><a id="_idTextAnchor036"/>Installing Visual Studio Code add-ons – GitLens</h2>
			<p>Among many other<a id="_idIndexMarker060"/> features, the GitLens extension will show who last made code changes in our GitHub<a id="_idIndexMarker061"/> repository.

			<p>In the preceding example, we can see that <em class="italic">line 31</em> was last updated 2 months ago by <em class="italic">Christian Bromann</em>. This makes it easy to know when a line of code was changed, by whom, and how <span class="No-Break">long ago.</span></p>
			<p>This add-on will help<a id="_idIndexMarker062"/> us find code mistakes<a id="_idIndexMarker063"/> to improve the reliability of <span class="No-Break">our framework.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor037"/>Installing Visual Studio Code add-ons – ESLint</h2>
			<p>A linter is a program that looks<a id="_idIndexMarker064"/> for potential problems in our code like dust that gathers in the corner<a id="_idIndexMarker065"/> of a room. There are linters for most programming languages, and ESLint is a TypeScript linter. Why ESLint and not JSLint? <strong class="bold">ES</strong> stands for <strong class="bold">ECMAScript</strong>, which is the code standard for JavaScript<a id="_idIndexMarker066"/> that is intended to ensure the interoperability of web pages across different browsers. As of this writing, the current version is ES6. When searching for code samples, pay attention if the code snippet is version ES5 or earlier as new features have been added over <span class="No-Break">the years.</span></p>
			<p>From <strong class="bold">Extensions</strong>, add the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">ESLint</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> extension:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer024" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19395_Figure_1.18.jpg" alt="Figure 1.18 – The ESLint ECMAScript linter extension"/>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.18 – The ESLint ECMAScript linter extension</p>
			<p>ESLint finds and reports on code patterns found in TypeScript projects. The goal is to make code more consistent and avoid bugs upfront. You can see it in use in the <span class="No-Break">following screenshot:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer025" class="IMG---Figure">

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.19 – Example of ESLint reporting 81 potential problems in a TypeScript project</p>
			<p>ESLint supplies a new <strong class="bold">PROBLEMS</strong> window that lists issues and suggestions for improving our code base as we enhance our framework. It can also be customized with <span class="No-Break">new rules.</span></p>
			<p><em class="italic">What is the difference between ECMAScript, JavaScript, </em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">and TypeScript?</em></span></p>
			<p>ECMAScript is the language definition of JavaScript that’s found in modern browsers. ES5 and ES6 are recent descriptions. TypeScript<a id="_idIndexMarker067"/> is a superset of JavaScript that adds type declarations<a id="_idIndexMarker068"/> to JavaScript, <span class="No-Break">like Java.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we have configured Visual Studio Code, let’s add a few tools to our browser for selectors <span class="No-Break">and cookies.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"/>Installing Chrome extensions</h1>
			<p>Our next two tools are the easiest to install. <strong class="bold">SelectorsHub</strong> allows us to create robust locators of elements<a id="_idIndexMarker069"/> in Chrome, Edge, and<a id="_idIndexMarker070"/> any Chromium-based browser, while <strong class="bold">EditThisCookie</strong> allows us to clear the cookie<a id="_idIndexMarker071"/> cache from the browser frontend. Later, we will ensure the framework will clear cookies for fresh <span class="No-Break">test execution.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"/>Adding the SelectorsHub Chrome extension</h2>
			<p>In the top-right corner<a id="_idIndexMarker072"/> of your Chrome browser, select the three vertical<a id="_idIndexMarker073"/> ellipses. Then, click on <strong class="bold">More tools</strong> and then <strong class="bold">Extensions</strong>. Click the hamburger icon in the top-left corner. Finally, click <strong class="bold">Open Chrome Web Store</strong> in the <span class="No-Break">lower-left corner:</span></p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer026" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/B19395_Figure_1.20.jpg" alt="Figure 1.20 – Adding a Chrome extension from Chrome Web Store"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.20 – Adding a Chrome extension from Chrome Web Store</p>
			<p>In Chrome Web Store, search for and install the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">SelectorsHub</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> extension:</span></p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.21 – The SelectorsHub Chrome extension</p>
			<p>Once the extension has been installed, it should be allowed to interact in <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Incognito</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> mode.</span></p>
			<p>From the <strong class="bold">Extensions</strong> page, click the <strong class="bold">Details</strong> button for <strong class="bold">SelectorsHub</strong> and set the <strong class="bold">Allow in Incognito</strong> switch <span class="No-Break">to active:</span></p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.22 – Allowing the SelectorsHub Chrome extension to appear in Incognito mode</p>
			<p>Similarly, we will add an extension that will make clearing our browser <span class="No-Break">cookies faster.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-35"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/>Adding the EditThisCookie Chrome extension</h2>
			<p>As with the previous extension, search for the <strong class="bold">EditThisCookie</strong> extension from Chrome <span class="No-Break">Web Store:</span></p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 1.23 – The EditThisCookie Chrome extension</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">EditThisCookie</strong> extension will make it easier to clear cookies in the browser. It takes only two clicks to clear all cookies, and it can clear the cookies of specific applications, such as our application <span class="No-Break">under test.</span></p>
			<p>Next, we will need these extensions to be visible on the Chrome browser for <span class="No-Break">easy access.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-36"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/>Pinning Chrome extensions to the browser title bar</h2>
			<p>Follow <span class="No-Break">these steps:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Click the jigsaw puzzle<a id="_idIndexMarker074"/> extensions icon in the top-right corner<a id="_idIndexMarker075"/> of <span class="No-Break">the browser.</span></li>
				<li>Click the <strong class="bold">pushpin</strong> icon next to <span class="No-Break">both extensions.</span></li>
				<li>These icons will now appear in the <strong class="bold">Extensions</strong> shortcuts area in the top-right corner of the browser for <span class="No-Break">easy access:</span></li>
			</ol>

			<p>Our utility belt is now complete. We have the coding environment, source code editor, and a few troubleshooting tools to help us leap tall projects in a single bound. Next, we’ll <span class="No-Break">install WebdriverIO.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-37"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>Installing WebdriverIO</h1>
			<p>There are two options to <a id="_idIndexMarker076"/>use and <span class="No-Break">install WebdriverIO</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Using WDIO TestRunner in <span class="No-Break">async mode</span></li>
				<li>Using WedbriverIO in <span class="No-Break">standalone mode</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the next chapter and throughout this book, we will be using the first option. Despite this, take a closer look at <span class="No-Break">both options:</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Option 1</strong>: Using WebdriverIO with its built-in WDIO TestRunner is the default mode and most common use case. The test runner efficiently addresses numerous challenges often encountered when utilizing<a id="_idIndexMarker077"/> basic automation libraries. First, it streamlines the management of your test executions by organizing and distributing test specifications to maximize concurrent testing. Additionally, it adeptly manages session operations and offers an array of features designed to aid in troubleshooting and error identification within your <span class="No-Break">test suite.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Option 2</strong>: When using WebdriverIO in standalone mode, you not only retain access to all protocol commands but also<a id="_idIndexMarker078"/> gain a valuable set of supplementary commands that facilitate a more advanced interaction with the web browser. This feature empowers you to seamlessly incorporate this automation tool into your projects, particularly for the development of custom automation libraries. Well-known instances of such integration are found in tools such as klassi-js, Spectron, and CodeceptJS. This mode’s usage is outside the scope of this book but you can check out the <strong class="source-inline">klassi-js</strong> repo (https://github.com/klassijs/klassi-js) at your leisure. There is also a project template that you can clone (<a href="https://github.com/klassijs/klassi-example-test-suite">https://github.com/klassijs/klassi-example-test-suite</a>) so that you have a running project <span class="No-Break">in seconds.</span></p>
			<p>The following is a sample script written as a test spec and executed <span class="No-Break">by WDIO:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
import { browser, $ } from '@wdio/globals'
describe('DuckDuckGo search', () =&gt; {
    it('Searches for WebdriverIO', async () =&gt; {
        await browser.url('https://duckduckgo.com/')
        await $('#search_form_input_homepage').setValue('WebdriverIO')
        await $('#search_button_homepage').click()
        const title = await browser.getTitle()
        expect(title).toBe('WebdriverIO at DuckDuckGo')
        // or just
        await expect(browser).toHaveTitle('WebdriverIO at DuckDuckGo')
    })
})</pre>			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">All WebdriverIO commands are <a id="_idIndexMarker079"/>asynchronous and need to be properly handled <span class="No-Break">using </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">async</strong></span><span class="No-Break">/</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">await</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-38"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we installed many of the tools required to begin coding a robust test automation framework. We enhanced our browser with two extensions to ease element-locator creation and handle cookies. The Node.js environment was installed with npm and a code repository folder was created. The Visual Studio Code IDE was installed with tools for static code analysis and code formatting, and we provided detailed information about when the code was modified and <span class="No-Break">by whom.</span></p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will install WebdriverIO and begin to explore the folder structure of the WebdriverIO TypeScript <span class="No-Break">framework project.</span></p>
