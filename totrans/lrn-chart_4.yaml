- en: This chapter covers several charts that can be created with Chart.js to efficiently
    communicate quantitative information and relationships. The choice of a chart
    depends on the type of data, how each set of values is related to one another,
    and what kind of relationships you want to show. In the previous chapter, we learned
    how to efficiently display data in bar charts and compare quantitative information
    related to different categories. In this chapter, you will create line and radar
    charts to compare sequences of one-dimensional data, pie and doughnut charts to
    compare proportions, scatterplots and bubble charts to represent two or more dimensions,
    and polar area charts to display quantitative data in a radial grid.

    one of the sets should contain categorical or ordered data (ascending or descending).
    The most common application of a line chart is th*e* time series*,* where the
    ordered set consists of instants of time. If arbitrary categories are used, it
    should be possible to establish some kind of connected sequence with them (for
    example, an ordered sequence of steps).

    with straight or curved lines that represent estimated values. Line charts can
    be used to predict intermediate values and reveal trends.

- en: Radar charts are line charts plotted on a radial axis. They can be used with
    one or more datasets that contain at least three values each. There is only one
    axis, which starts from the center. Each line begins and ends at the same point
    and, for that reason, radar charts are usually used to display values that are
    either cyclic in nature (such as hours, months, schedules, or repeating events),
    a sequential list of categories which end at the same place where it begins (such
    as round-trip), or categories that have no specific order. A radar chart can be
    used to compare different datasets by revealing strong and weak points, or showing
    outliers and commonality in data. It usually works best with a small number of
    datasets (that is, no more than three or four).
  prefs: []

- en: Radar charts are usually a poor choice for large datasets. In these cases, it's

    trends, clusters, linear, and non-linear relationships. It's an essential tool
