    turning in their assignments through Google Classroom. During my time teaching,
    I learned that if I did not explicitly show students how to turn in assignments,
    I would receive them incomplete or through email. To save extra work in collecting
    assignments, take a few moments at the beginning of the first few assignments
    to show students how to properly turn in assignments. After assigning the assignment,
    have a student log into a computer connected to a projector so that you can show
    the students the steps to correctly submit the assignment.

    each student** setting is the simplest method for students to turn in an assignment.
    With the Bean Sprout Lab example, the assignment contains one Google Doc that
    the student needs to edit. Since it was shared with the **Make a copy for each
    student** setting, when the student opens the Google document, a **TURN IN** button
    will appear in the menu as shown in the following screenshot:'
