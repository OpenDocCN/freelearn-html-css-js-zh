- en: We’ll start this chapter by understanding the core concepts of analyzing log
    data in microservices with Node.js, which is crucial for understanding system
    behavior, diagnosing issues, and optimizing performance. Interpreting logs in
    microservices architecture involves analyzing the log data generated by your Node.js
    microservices to gain insights into their behavior, troubleshoot issues, and monitor
    their health. By effectively interpreting logging data in your Node.js microservices,
    you can gain valuable insights into the system’s behavior, detect and troubleshoot
    issues, and monitor the overall health of your microservices architecture.
