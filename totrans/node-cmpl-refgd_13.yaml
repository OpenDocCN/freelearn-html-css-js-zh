    The middleware chain is always called in the exact order in which it has been
    defined, so it is vital for you to know exactly what a specific piece of middleware
    is doing. Once a middleware function finishes, it calls the next function in the
    chain by invoking its next argument as a function. After the complete chain gets

    renaming, or deleting files or directories; truncating; linking; `chmod` functions;
    as well as synchronous and asynchronous file access for reading and writing data.
    In our sample application, we aim to use the most straightforward approach, so
    we implement functions that read the `catalog.json` file by utilizing the `readFileSync`
    function of the File System module. It returns the content of a file as a string,

    it to transform the keys in these associative objects into an array so that we

    language and encoding the results should be provided in. If the server fails to
    provide the results in the expected format, it can either return a default value

    is a sensitive topic. As consumers may not be able to handle the modified data
    appropriately and there is no way of notifying all of them, we need to keep our
    APIs as backward-compatible as possible. One way to do so is to use different
    URIs for different versions of our application. Currently, our catalog API is
    available at `/catalog`.
  prefs: []

    to keep the previous version available at another URI for backward-compatibility.
    Best practice is to encode the version number in the URI, such as `/v1/catalog`,
    and keep `/catalog` mapped to the latest version. Thus, requesting `/catalog`
    will cause a redirect to `/v2/catalog` and will make use of the HTTP `3xx` status
    codes to indicate the redirection to the latest version.
