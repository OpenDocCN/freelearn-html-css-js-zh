- en: The purpose of this book is to help .NET or Java developers make the leap to
    Node.js. You may have some web development experience, and perhaps you've written
    some browser-based JavaScript in the past. It might not be obvious why anyone
    would want to take JavaScript out of the browser and use it for server-side development.
    However, this is exactly what Node.js does. What's more, Node.js has been around
    for long enough now to have matured as a platform, and has sustained its impressive
    growth in popularity well beyond any period that could be attributed to initial
    hype over a new technology.

- en: The first objective of this book then is to explain why Node.js is a compelling
    technology that's worth learning more about. The first few chapters introduce
    Node.js with this in mind, quickly get you up and running with Node.js, and provide
    an important (re) introduction to the JavaScript language to set you on the right
    track.

- en: The main part of this book will then take you through a worked example of building
    up a Node.js web-application step by step. In the process, we'll illustrate all
    the important tools and techniques required for real-world development projects
    in Node.js. The aim is to make the most of your existing development expertise
    to allow you to quickly reach the same level of best practices and professionalism
    with Node.js.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The final chapters of the book show how to use Node.js for other purposes outside
    of web applications and how to continue learning Node.js and exploring the ecosystem
    around it. We'll also see how you can use Node.js alongside .NET and benefit from
    applying your programming skills across both technologies.

    Most of the worked examples require an active web connection at some point. To
    get started, you need nothing more than a console, a web browser, and permission
    to install new software on your machine. To support developers coming from a .NET
    background, some of the console listings or example steps in this book use Windows
    conventions (for example, backslashes in paths). None of the examples depend on
    Windows specifically though. You can work through this book on Windows, Mac OSX,
    or Linux.

    No prior experience with Node.js is expected. You might have written some client-side
    JavaScript before, but this is not required. The main worked example in this book
    is a Node.js web application. Web development experience in .NET or Java will
    be helpful, but it's not necessary to have experience with any particular application
    library or framework.
