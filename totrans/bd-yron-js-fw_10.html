<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1">Reducing the learning curve</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">: Framework authors will continue investing in making interfaces more approachable, especially for new developers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.2">In both server and frontend environments, this could mean further aligning with the structure of web APIs, which helps avoid introducing new types of abstractions that have unique interfaces. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.3">A tip to a future framework developer would be to contemplate how a learning curve could be simplified for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">your projects.</span></span></li>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-187"><a id="_idTextAnchor186"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.1">Additional considerations</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.1">In </span><a href="B19014_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor073"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.1">Chapter 5</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.1">, we explored a wide range of framework considerations, specifically affecting the technical architecture. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.2">As creating a new framework project, even with a totally unique </span><a id="_idIndexMarker705"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.1">technical feature set, is a big decision, let's examine a few additional considerations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.2">Outside of the technical challenges, this examination will help us decide whether starting a project from scratch and maintaining it for a long time is worth an investment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.3">Successfully producing a framework project with a lot of stakeholders and targeted users will require both time investment and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.1">financial backing.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.1">Besides the technical hurdles and architectural challenges, framework developers need to consider the probable return on investment when embarking on a new project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.2">Looking at some of the established projects in the JavaScript space, many of them have been multi-year investments, with a huge number of developers contributing paid or open source time to enable the feature set. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.3">Let’s focus on the particular three pillars of time investment, user support, and financial backing in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.1">following sections.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-188"><a id="_idTextAnchor187"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.1">Time investment</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.1">Framework </span><a id="_idIndexMarker706"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.1">developers need to consider a new project’s time investment and lifespan. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.2">It’s not simply about the development phase but also the life cycle commitment it entails, which could affect multiple teams within an organization or the company’s larger goals. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.3">Open source developers have similar commitments to consider but with lesser responsibility, especially at the early stages of the project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.4">Unlike typical JavaScript application projects, framework development typically doesn’t have a linear timeline or a designated end milestone where a deliverable is considered complete. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.5">Instead, the process is iterative, with development cycles, testing, refinement, and updating. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.6">These themes link back to the chapters on maintenance and the development life cycle of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.1">new features.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.292.1">A framework </span><a id="_idIndexMarker707"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.293.1">project will demand more than a sizable initial coding investment created by one developer or a whole team. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.293.2">The ongoing updates necessary to adapt to ever-evolving requirements and technological conventions will require equally weighty commitments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.293.3">Considering the tasks we saw in </span><a href="B19014_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor156"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.294.1">Chapter 9</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.295.1">, the maintenance time investment encompasses the need for a comprehensive workflow, involving many developers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.295.2">When choosing to build a new solution, consider how much time you are willing to invest and what size framework you can successfully execute on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.295.3">Making a considerate decision will determine whether your framework effort </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.1">will succeed.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-189"><a id="_idTextAnchor188"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.297.1">User support</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.1">As important as time investment is user support, which often determines the success of a project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.2">Besides producing readable and well-organized documentation, a deep understanding </span><a id="_idIndexMarker708"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.1">of the challenges and needs of users spans beyond the code base. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.2">For all types of framework projects, as a developer, you will find yourself or your team acting as support and troubleshooting framework integration aspects. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.3">To give a public example, the Vue.js project has a discussion forum where users publish their technical and architectural questions: </span><a href="https://github.com/vuejs/core/discussions"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.1">github.com/vuejs/core/discussions</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.2">It is up to the team to respond to these queries and maintain a good community posture. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.3">In projects that are internal to the company, framework authors often set up a similar platform to interact with consumers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.4">For smaller companies, this support interaction is much more hands-on and direct. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.5">However, in all of these scenarios, the support aspects take up important </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.302.1">development time.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.1">The best strategy to reduce this type of churn is to constantly work on improving support workflows. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.2">Improvements can include organizing frequently asked questions for later use, creating guides for complicated framework integrations, and making the framework knowledge base as discoverable as possible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.3">Just like the cyclical development process seen in </span><a href="B19014_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor156"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.304.1">Chapter 9</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.305.1">, as a maintainer, you will find yourself in an ongoing commitment to support new and older users of your project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.305.2">For a project to be successful, you have </span><a id="_idIndexMarker709"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.1">to put your users first and be able to address their needs in an </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.1">acceptable manner.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.308.1">All this time investment in additional aspects of framework building requires a monetary budget, which we will highlight in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.1">following section.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-190"><a id="_idTextAnchor189"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.310.1">Financial backing</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.1">Among the complex technical challenges, time investment, and logistics of supporting a project, there is another </span><a id="_idIndexMarker710"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.312.1">factor to consider for a framework – that is, the presence of financial backing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.312.2">Funding a new project will require enduring the ongoing expenses for feature development and infrastructure costs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.312.3">Additional costs could arise, depending on the environment of your project – for example, if you are trying to promote an enterprise framework to potential customers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.312.4">In a company setting, where the framework powers the foundational services and products indirectly, the funding can trickle down from the profits of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.313.1">the products.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.1">Most open source projects are often not fully funded but could be sponsored by a larger organization with a big enough budget for projects, which also indirectly help development efforts or advance the agenda of the organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.2">For instance, the Cypress open source testing framework has a paid Cypress Cloud service that enables a dedicated environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.3">Conversely, some of the open source developers utilize platforms such as Patreon or GitHub Sponsors to fund projects, getting direct financial contributions from companies and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.315.1">individual users.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.1">These additional considerations can play an important role in planning and executing your project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.2">Depending on your development goals, some of these factors can make or break the framework project you are trying </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.1">to establish.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.319.1">This chapter has brought to attention the three final topics that can help framework developers better understand the efforts of creating new frameworks, under the common themes of JavaScript development. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.319.2">A look at the future of projects also helps developers understand and prepare for what is to come in this particular technological space. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.319.3">By exploring the common themes, you gain knowledge of how modular projects can be and how their design evolves as time goes on, making it easier to make decisions about self-created projects. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.319.4">Similarly, learning about approaches to performance optimizations and unique architectural patterns can be beneficial to prospective </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.1">framework authors.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.1">In the second section, the chapter highlighted upcoming trends and looked at the future potential of frameworks, offering us a glimpse of what is to come in this space. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.2">The next generation of framework authors and maintainers gets to experience the new challenges of the JavaScript environment and refactor existing solutions to make them more capable in new ways. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.3">The expectations of a better developer experience and the still unknown possibilities of LLMs keep the framework space super exciting for both experienced and upcoming </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.322.1">JavaScript developers.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.1">Toward the end, the chapter highlighted additional considerations that can help developers make the right decisions in terms of starting new projects. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.2">These non-technical considerations are much less exciting to the developers, but they are crucial to the framework creation process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.3">This final chapter aims to provide further insights to bolster your understanding of framework development and prepare you for success in your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.324.1">real-world projects.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.1">In conclusion, the goal of this and all the chapters before it was to demystify the framework development methods and make the process of building your own JavaScript frameworks much more approachable to all. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.2">With this acquired knowledge, you now have the skills to make better decisions and drive more complex framework-related projects to success. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.3">We began this book with our journey, looking at existing projects, then identified crucial parts of framework development, and later concluded by building a full-stack framework from scratch. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.4">This includes an exploration of architectural patterns and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.1">project considerations.</span></span></p>
