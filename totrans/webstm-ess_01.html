<div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch01lvl1sec09" class="calibre1"/>Installing WebStorm</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">I believe that <a id="id3" class="calibre1"/>you are intrigued by all these features and are now longing to try out WebStorm 10 to leverage them. We need to install the IDE. You can find the <a id="id4" class="calibre1"/>download package directly on the WebStorm website at <a class="calibre1" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/</a>.</p><p class="calibre7">One of the strongest advantages of WebStorm is that it's cross-platform. You can run WebStorm on the following operating systems:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">OS X 10.5 or higher, including 10.10</li><li class="listitem">Microsoft Windows 8/7/Vista/2003/XP (including 64-bit)</li><li class="listitem">GNU/Linux with GNOME or the KDE desktop</li></ul></div><p class="calibre7">Besides, your machine should have the following configuration so as to painlessly run the IDE:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">A minimum of 512 MB of RAM (1 GB of RAM is recommended)</li><li class="listitem">Intel Pentium III/800 MHz or higher (or compatible)</li><li class="listitem">A minimum screen resolution of 1024 x 768</li><li class="listitem">Oracle (Sun) JDK 1.6+</li></ul></div><p class="calibre7">Depending on the OS, the installation process varies slightly, but it still remains simple.</p><p class="calibre7">On a Mac machine, you should:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem" value="1">Mount the downloaded <code class="email">WebStorm-10*.dmg</code> disk image file as another disk in your system.</li><li class="listitem" value="2">Copy WebStorm to your <code class="email">Applications</code> folder.</li></ol><div></div><p class="calibre7">On a Windows machine, you should:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem" value="1">Run the downloaded <code class="email">WebStorm-10*.exe</code> file that starts the installation wizard.</li><li class="listitem" value="2">Follow all steps suggested by the wizard.</li></ol><div></div><p class="calibre7">On a Linux <a id="id5" class="calibre1"/>machine, you should:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem" value="1">Unpack the downloaded <code class="email">WebStorm-10*.tar.gz</code> file using the following command:<div><pre class="programlisting">

<div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_1"><a id="ch01lvl2sec07" class="calibre1"/>Configuring WebStorm</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">You need to <a id="id6" class="calibre1"/>configure a couple of things to complete the installation and proceed to work in the IDE.</p><p class="calibre7">First, it's suggested you import your settings from a previous version. However, since we assume here that you are new to WebStorm, click on the <strong class="calibre8">I don't have a previous version of WebStorm or I don't want to import settings</strong> button, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/00002.jpeg" alt="Configuring WebStorm" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">Then, you get a popup of the <strong class="calibre8">WebStorm License Activation</strong> dialog, where you can activate your license if it exists, buy it, or run a 30-day WebStorm trial. Read the license agreement and accept all its terms. The following screenshot shows this:</p><div><img src="img/00003.jpeg" alt="Configuring WebStorm" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">When you are done with the license, in the <strong class="calibre8">WebStorm Initial Configuration</strong> dialog, you can set the <strong class="calibre8">Keymap scheme</strong> depending on what is habitual to you, the <strong class="calibre8">IDE theme</strong>, and the <strong class="calibre8">Editor colors and fonts</strong> <a id="id7" class="calibre1"/>depending on what you prefer more—dark or bright colors. Use the <strong class="calibre8">Click to preview</strong> section to evaluate whether the theme and colors you have set fit your needs and preferences or not. The shortcuts in this book are based on the <strong class="calibre8">Mac OS X 10.5+</strong> scheme. The following screenshot captures this discussion aptly:</p><div><img src="img/00004.jpeg" alt="Configuring WebStorm" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch01lvl1sec10" class="calibre1"/>The user interface</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">Now we have <a id="id8" class="calibre1"/>WebStorm installed, so the time is ripe to look into its interface—the world where you are supposed to dwell when developing web applications. It is necessary that you understand the interface in order to be in your <a id="id9" class="calibre1"/>element and make your use in WebStorm efficient and pleasant.</p></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_1"><a id="ch01lvl2sec08" class="calibre1"/>Before you start</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">The first time that you run <a id="id10" class="calibre1"/>WebStorm or, later, when no project is open, you will see a welcome screen as follows:</p><div><img src="img/00005.jpeg" alt="Before you start" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">You can either create a new project, open an existing one, check out the code from version control systems, or choose a setting action to perform from the <strong class="calibre8">Configure</strong> drop-down list. To get familiar with the WebStorm user interface, let's create a new, simple HTML project.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_2"><a id="ch01lvl2sec09" class="calibre1"/>Creating a new project</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">To create a new <a id="id11" class="calibre1"/>project, follow these steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem" value="1">Click on the <strong class="calibre8">Create New Project</strong> button, and the <strong class="calibre8">New Project</strong> dialog opens.</li><li class="listitem" value="2">Give a name to our project, for example, <code class="email">MyFirstWebProject</code>, and specify the folder for the project files, either manually or by choosing the folder using the browse (<strong class="calibre8">…</strong>) button.</li><li class="listitem" value="3">Then, leave the <strong class="calibre8">Project type</strong> field with the <strong class="calibre8">Empty project</strong> value—for now, we are just going to immerse in the interface and not create something really useful—and click on the <strong class="calibre8">OK</strong> button. The following screenshot depicts these steps:<div><img src="img/00006.jpeg" alt="Creating a new project" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre14"> </p></li></ol><div></div></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_3"><a id="ch01lvl2sec10" class="calibre1"/>The WebStorm workspace</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">The WebStorm <a id="id12" class="calibre1"/>main window opens. It can be visually divided into <a id="id13" class="calibre1"/>seven logical parts, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/00007.jpeg" alt="The WebStorm workspace" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">Instead of simply introducing them, let's create a very simple yet rather interesting project—that of automatically locating you with Google Maps. In the preceding image, you can see the final version of what we are going to do. So, after completing this section, you will have the same view.</p><p class="calibre7">So, what you can see now is the following:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">The <strong class="calibre8">Menu line</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">1</strong>), which has a bunch of options, including the standard <strong class="calibre8">File</strong>, <strong class="calibre8">Edit</strong>, <strong class="calibre8">View</strong> options and the WebStorm-specific <strong class="calibre8">Code</strong>, <strong class="calibre8">Refactor</strong>, <strong class="calibre8">Run</strong>, and <strong class="calibre8">VCS</strong> ones.</li><li class="listitem">The main window is divided into two plainly distinguishable parts:<div><ul class="itemizedlist1"><li class="listitem">The <strong class="calibre8">Project tool panel</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">4</strong>) on the left-hand side, where you will see your project structure and file. You now only have a line with the project name, yet in the image, you can already see the hierarchical structure of our project. The Project tool panel correlates with another interface element, <strong class="calibre8">Tool tabs</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">3</strong>), which I will describe a bit later.</li><li class="listitem">The <strong class="calibre8">Editor panel</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">5</strong>) on the right-hand side, where you will type your code.</li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem">Slightly above these two panels, you can find <strong class="calibre8">Navigation toolbar</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">2</strong>). For now, you have it with a sole breadcrumb, <code class="email">MyFirstWebProject</code>, prepended with a typical folder icon and appended with a right-arrow shape, yet in the image, there are <a id="id14" class="calibre1"/>three breadcrumbs, where each one stands for the next hierarchy level. The Navigation toolbar is great for quick navigation and better understanding of the project file hierarchy.</li><li class="listitem">At the very bottom, you <a id="id15" class="calibre1"/>can find <strong class="calibre8">Status bar</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">7</strong>), which contains some auxiliary information, such as denoting the current caret position in the editor (in the <code class="email">line:column</code> format), line ending type (Windows-styled, Mac-styled, and so on), encoding the current file in the editor, and so on.</li></ul></div><p class="calibre7">Your project is as yet empty. Let's get down to business! Add an HTML file to the project by right-clicking on the project name in the <strong class="calibre8">Project</strong> tool window, and name it <code class="email">map.html</code> or simply <code class="email">map</code>. This is encapsulated in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/00008.jpeg" alt="The WebStorm workspace" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="note02" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre7">Note that unambiguously indicating the extension is optional because it is automatically added depending on the kind of field chosen.</p></div><p class="calibre7">In the editor, you see simple HTML5 starter code. There, let's indicate where our map will be displayed. It will be a simple <code class="email">div</code> element with the <code class="email">map</code> ID:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">&lt;div id="map"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre></div><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="note03" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre7">I suggest you to keep from simply copying any code given in at least the first few chapters so that you acutely feel the advantages that WebStorm offers you.</p></div><p class="calibre7">In the <code class="email">body</code> section, start typing <code class="email">&lt;div&gt;</code>. As you type each symbol, what you see is that WebStorm suggests appropriate tags within the current content. You can navigate through the drop-down tag list with a mouse and select a tag with the <em class="calibre9">Enter</em> key in the same way that you can add attributes to the tag. When you type <code class="email">&gt;</code>, you will find that WebStorm automatically closes the tag if it is a pair tag. You should notice that WebStorm puts the cursor directly where you will further write the tag or attribute value; it slightly yet pleasantly saves some time. While you work on WebStorm, there is no need to save your files; by default, it will watch for changes in your files when you change your frame and save them automatically. This behavior can be set up/ modified in the <strong class="calibre8">Preferences</strong> | <strong class="calibre8">Appearances &amp; Behavior</strong> | <strong class="calibre8">System Settings</strong> dialog</p><p class="calibre7">Now we need JavaScript <a id="id16" class="calibre1"/>code to render the map. To add it, first create a <a id="id17" class="calibre1"/>new directory, <code class="email">js</code>, in the project root directory and add there a JavaScript file, <code class="email">map.js</code>. It opens in a new tab and contains a comment on the author and the creation time. Fill the file with the following code:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">var map;

function initialize() {
    var mapOptions = {
        zoom: 10
    };
    map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map'), mapOptions);
    if(navigator.geolocation) {
        navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) {
            var pos = new google.maps.LatLng(position.coords.latitude, position.coords.longitude);
            var infowindow = new google.maps.InfoWindow({
                map: map,
                position: pos,
                content: 'I am here!'
            });
            map.setCenter(pos);
        }, function() {
            handleNoGeolocation(true);
        });
    } else {
        handleNoGeolocation(false);
    }
}

function handleNoGeolocation(errorFlag) {
    if (errorFlag) {
        var content = 'Error: The Geolocation service failed.';
    } else {
        var content = 'Error: Your browser doesn\'t support geolocation.';
    }
    var options = {
        map: map,
        position: new google.maps.LatLng(60, 105),
        content: content
    };
    var infowindow = new google.maps.InfoWindow(options);
    map.setCenter(options.position);
}

google.maps.event.addDomListener(window, 'load', initialize);</pre></div><p class="calibre7">The code we just created uses the Google Maps API's features, renders the map on your HTML page, locates you, and shows an <strong class="calibre8">I am here!</strong> message there.</p><p class="calibre7">Let's now pay attention to one more workspace element. It is located at almost the bottom of the IDE (6). Doesn't <a id="id18" class="calibre1"/>this remind you of something? Yes, it is a standard <a id="id19" class="calibre1"/>Terminal of your OS, which is integrated into WebStorm. You can activate it in the bottom-left corner by either clicking on the <strong class="calibre8">Terminal</strong> button, or selecting the <strong class="calibre8">Terminal</strong> option in the drop-down option list when clicking on the <img src="img/00009.jpeg" alt="The WebStorm workspace" class="calibre15"/> icon, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/00010.jpeg" alt="The WebStorm workspace" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">The terminal opens, and you can use it as if you were using the terminal built in to your OS. I want you to create one more directory—<code class="email">css</code>—to keep the <code class="email">map.css</code> file via the WebStorm Terminal. Simply execute the following commands, and both the <code class="email">css</code> directory and <code class="email">map.css</code> file appear in the <strong class="calibre8">Project</strong> tool panel:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong class="calibre8">$ mkdir css</strong>
<strong class="calibre8">$ cd css</strong>
</pre></div><p class="calibre7">You will now have a <a id="id20" class="calibre1"/>new directory named <code class="email">css</code>. In this folder, create a new <a id="id21" class="calibre1"/>CSS file named <code class="email">map.css</code> from the context dialog or <strong class="calibre8">File</strong> | <strong class="calibre8">New</strong> menu. There is no advantage in using the terminal in preference to context menu manipulations, or vice versa. Which you use is up to you, but since we are exploring an instrument, WebStorm, that is new to you, I will nevertheless prefer using its interface as much as possible.</p><p class="calibre7">Now double-click on the <code class="email">map.css</code> file in the project structure hierarchy and fill it with the following code:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">html, body, #map {
    height: 100%;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0
}</pre></div><p class="calibre7">Now we need to add the finishing touch—we should tell HTML to use our CSS and JavaScript files as well as point out where the Google Maps API is located. We can do it by simply adding the link and script tags to the <code class="email">head</code> section. In the same way that it was described, you can use WebStorm's code completion feature to speed up your code typing. I want to mention one more feature now which is really essential here (we will talk about WebStorm's smart code completion in detail in the next chapter). It concerns those attributes that point to the other project files—in our case, it is the <code class="email">src</code> and <code class="email">href</code> attributes. There is no need to manually search for files to point at from these tags (it is especially appreciable in huge projects)—WebStorm does everything for you. When already being between quotes and waiting to input an attribute value, you can simply press on <em class="calibre9">Ctrl</em> + <em class="calibre9">Space</em> (on Windows) / <em class="calibre9">Ctrl</em> + <em class="calibre9">Space</em> (on Mac), and WebStorm displays only those files in the drop-down list that are possible in this context. If there are too many files, you can simply start typing the name of the file and WebStorm's smart completion does its work, too. Of course, it is a scintilla of what WebStorm can offer you. You will become familiar with a bundle of smart techniques in the next chapter.</p><p class="calibre7">So, the resulting HTML <a id="id22" class="calibre1"/>code is the following:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head lang="en"&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Where am I?&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link href="css/map.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"&gt;
    &lt;script src="img/js?v=3.exp" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="img/map.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;div id="map"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre></div><p class="calibre7">The last yet not least important interface element is Tool tabs (3), which I have already mentioned, but only now, we can see the benefits of using it. Earlier, we were on the <strong class="calibre8">Project</strong> tab, where we could <a id="id23" class="calibre1"/>see the file and directory hierarchy. Change the tab for the <strong class="calibre8">Structure</strong> one, and for each file—<code class="email">map.html</code>, <code class="email">map.js</code>, and <code class="email">map.css</code>—you will see the following:</p><div><img src="img/00011.jpeg" alt="The WebStorm workspace" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">This is also a hierarchy, but not of filesystem elements; this is a content-based hierarchy. For HTML, it means tag hierarchy; for CSS, all styles are enumerated; and for JavaScript, you can see information about all objects and functions with parameters. Moreover, clicking on any line moves you directly to the place in the code where the element on this line is declared or exists.</p><p class="calibre7">Voilà, your first project <a id="id24" class="calibre1"/>within WebStorm is ready! Now it's <a id="id25" class="calibre1"/>time to run our page.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_4"><a id="ch01lvl2sec11" class="calibre1"/>Running the application</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">Do you remember <a id="id26" class="calibre1"/>that the purpose of any IDE is to take as many actions as possible upon itself in order to help you to only concentrate on designing projects and typing code, instead of performing a huge number of minor yet numerous actions? It means that most of the time, you will stay within the four walls of the IDE, performing almost all actions from inside it. If you need to perform something outside the IDE, give a thought to whether you can perform it by means of the IDE. However, there is one thing for which you will need to leave the IDE—it is your browser. You need to see your results, don't you? But even in this case, WebStorm helps you. When you were typing the HTML code, did you notice a browser icon list panel in the top-right corner in the editor? Here's what the panel looks like:</p><div><img src="img/00012.jpeg" alt="Running the application" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">Yes, each icon is a shortcut to a browser executable, and if you click on any one, the corresponding browser opens with the current page. Note that only installed browsers will open.</p><p class="calibre7">The page with your current location opens at the address <code class="email">http://localhost:63342/MyFirstWebProject/map.html</code>. Don't be afraid if you see a blank page. First, you need to allow your browser to get your location as it will ask about it. Then, you will see a map wherein your location will be indicated with the words <strong class="calibre8">I am here!</strong>.</p><p class="calibre7">The only question that remains is, what is the strange number after the <code class="email">localhost</code> word? WebStorm provides the facility of a simple HTTP server running on the default port <code class="email">63342</code>. You can change the port in IDE Settings.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch01lvl1sec11" class="calibre1"/>Settings and preferences</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">By now, we <a id="id27" class="calibre1"/>are going to speak about customizing something not in the <a id="id28" class="calibre1"/>code, but in WebStorm itself, so I must tell you <a id="id29" class="calibre1"/>about the multifarious settings that WebStorm offers.</p><p class="calibre7">There are two similar yet separate settings windows:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">The settings of the whole IDE</li><li class="listitem">The settings of the current project</li></ul></div><p class="calibre7">For the first case, to open the <a id="id30" class="calibre1"/>settings window, you can simply press <a id="id31" class="calibre1"/>either <em class="calibre9">Ctrl</em> + <em class="calibre9">Alt</em> + <em class="calibre9">S</em> (Windows) or <em class="calibre9">⌘</em> + <em class="calibre9">,</em> (Mac), and you will get the following screen:</p><div><img src="img/00013.jpeg" alt="Settings and preferences" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">To access project settings, select <strong class="calibre8">File</strong> | <strong class="calibre8">Default Settings</strong>, and you will get something similar to the WebStorm settings, but with a reduced list of configurable options.</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="note04" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre7">I should say at once that settings are not a thing that matters every day, so you needn't think of it as something to necessarily be utterly and completely configured—in most cases, everything is already tuned up; moreover, if something needs configuring, it will pop up as an information balloon with a direct link to a setting.</p></div><p class="calibre7">If you need to configure <a id="id32" class="calibre1"/>something, what you will need to do is quickly find the <a id="id33" class="calibre1"/>necessary setting. To do that, start typing its name in the search field, and, as you type, the first matching setting gets highlighted, and the corresponding page is displayed.</p><p class="calibre7">But let's stroll further <a id="id34" class="calibre1"/>through the settings. I am not aiming to describe all the settings, but still I am going to cover the most important ones.</p></div>

Maybe during the process of programming, you realized that you'd better use another theme and/or color.</p><p class="calibre7">If you want to change a theme of the IDE, go to the <strong class="calibre8">Appearance</strong> subsection of the <strong class="calibre8">Appearance &amp; Behavior</strong> section. There, you will find the <strong class="calibre8">Theme</strong> drop-down list where you can change your current theme, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/00014.jpeg" alt="Themes and colors" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">If you want to change a color for a certain section of your IDE, you can go to the <strong class="calibre8">Colors &amp; Fonts</strong> subsection of the <strong class="calibre8">Editor</strong> section and try various parameters there so as to find the ones that suit you. You can observe the changes in real time by clicking on the <strong class="calibre8">Apply</strong> button. This <a id="id36" class="calibre1"/>discussion is aptly depicted in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/00015.jpeg" alt="Themes and colors" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_2"><a id="ch01lvl2sec13" class="calibre1"/>Keymap</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">The keymap is that very <a id="id37" class="calibre1"/>thing that developers must know and feel on the tips of their fingers because the proficiency level to use shortcut keys is directly proportional to the speed of development. It is evident that each person has his own preferences of what key combination to use in each case. So, the IDE should take into account the necessity to customize the keymap so as to suit a larger number of developers.</p><p class="calibre7">WebStorm offers you comprehensive keymap management, which you can access in the <strong class="calibre8">Keymap</strong> subsection of the <strong class="calibre8">Appearance &amp; Behavior</strong> section. For each menu item and command accessible inside the IDE, you get an opportunity to change the default key combination. Of course, WebStorm prevents you from overwriting and overriding the already existing combinations with a warning message.</p><p class="calibre7">To add a new shortcut or to change an existing one, you need to just select what you are going to process and click on the <strong class="calibre8">Remove</strong> or/and <strong class="calibre8">Add Keyboard Shortcut</strong> button—depending on what you intend to do. Then, simply press the combination that you would like to set for a certain action, and that's all.</p><p class="calibre7">This is great news for those who migrated from one OS to another or from one IDE to WebStorm. If you are already used to a keymap specific to your previous workspace, you need to first check the <strong class="calibre8">Keymap</strong> options list, where you can reliably find an option that satisfies you. Among the options are Emacs, Visual Studio, Eclipse, NetBeans, Mac OS X, Linux, Windows, and so on.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_3"><a id="ch01lvl2sec14" class="calibre1"/>Code Style</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">In the <strong class="calibre8">Code Style</strong> <a id="id38" class="calibre1"/>subsection of the <strong class="calibre8">Editor</strong> section, you can see the possibility of customizing the appearance of each language in which you an write the code using WebStorm: JavaScript, CoffeeScript, CSS, Haml, JSON, Dart, XML, YAML, and so on.</p><p class="calibre7">Settings about the languages that you can change are uncountable. You can set the indent size, indent type, and if you are using tabs, their size, where to put or not put spaces, how to perform wrapping, and lot of other aspects. On the customization panel for each language is a preview of what you get if you change something.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_4"><a id="ch01lvl2sec15" class="calibre1"/>Languages &amp; Frameworks</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">There is a <a id="id39" class="calibre1"/>
<strong class="calibre8">Languages &amp; Frameworks</strong> section in settings that is responsible for the technologies considered to be used. Here, you can specify the executables for the necessary frameworks and language interpreters, set the default parameters to run with, add packages for them, and so on. The following screenshot encapsulates the discussion aptly:</p><div><img src="img/00016.jpeg" alt="Languages &amp; Frameworks" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_5"><a id="ch01lvl2sec16" class="calibre1"/>Plugins</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">Plugins are an <a id="id40" class="calibre1"/>important part of WebStorm because they can dramatically expand the core functionality of the IDE.</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="note05" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre7">Be selective and do not install the plugins one by one. Remember that the more plugins you install, the more the time it will take you to launch the IDE, and the poorer the performance it will have. But don't be afraid of installing plugins—each one adds just a couple of dozens of milliseconds to the startup time of your IDE, so you will not experience performance degradation unless you install only necessary plugins. Up to 10-15 plugins is fine for performance as well as enough for a typical project.</p></div><p class="calibre7">You can manage plugins in the <strong class="calibre8">Plugins</strong> section of the <strong class="calibre8">Preferences</strong> window, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/00017.jpeg" alt="Plugins" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">The plugins that are checked are already installed and accessible inside the IDE. If you need more plugins, there are two ways of getting them. You can either browse them in online repositories or install already downloaded or engineered plugins directly from the disk.</p><p class="calibre7">The difference between the <strong class="calibre8">Install JetBrains plugin…</strong> window and the <strong class="calibre8">Browse repositories…</strong> window is that the second one allows you to install any plugin available in online repositories, whether it be third-party or of JetBrains.</p><p class="calibre7">There is nothing about <a id="id41" class="calibre1"/>it in the installation process of a plugin. You need to just find what you want and simply click on the <strong class="calibre8">Install Plugin from disk…</strong> button.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_6"><a id="ch01lvl2sec17" class="calibre1"/>Version Control</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">Any development process, be it web, desktop, or whatever else, is inconceivable without version control. That <a id="id42" class="calibre1"/>commits IDEs to integrate various version control systems, and WebStorm is not an exception. WebStorm supports <strong class="calibre8">Git</strong>, <strong class="calibre8">Subversion</strong>, <strong class="calibre8">Mercurial</strong>, <strong class="calibre8">CVS</strong>, and <strong class="calibre8">Perforce</strong> besides providing a binding with your GitHub account. Besides, WebStorm provides you with the facility of the so-called "local history", which enables you to track any changes in the code by means of the IDE, without using dedicated VCSes. Despite the differences between these VCSes, WebStorm allows you to use them in similar ways. As an IDE, WebStorm, of course, takes a lot of issues, so dealing with VCSes is visual and becomes even simpler than via the standard command line.</p><p class="calibre7">You can decide which actions require confirmation (in the following image), specify which ones can run in the background, configure what is to be ignored, manage history cache handling, and so on. Then, you will be able to unnoticeably yet skillfully manage your VCS using just shortcut keys. <strong class="calibre8">Version Control</strong> is depicted in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/00018.jpeg" alt="Version Control" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_7"><a id="ch01lvl2sec18" class="calibre1"/>Proxy</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">You may need to use <a id="id43" class="calibre1"/>WebStorm at work. A lot of companies are using internal networks, so it may turn out in a way that you will not be able to perform most Internet-oriented actions without a proxy. There may also be something else, which prevents you from comfortably working on the Internet. So, let's learn how to set up a proxy in WebStorm.</p><p class="calibre7">Instead of manually searching where the proxy settings are located, let's query the search box about it, entering the word <code class="email">proxy</code> there. It will instantly not only show where the proxy settings are, but also filter out only the menu sections containing "proxy". Moreover, it highlights all the parameters that contain the word "proxy", so we can rapidly find what we are searching for.</p><p class="calibre7">For the proxy to process connections is a small matter. You need to fill out the blank fields as displayed here and click on the <strong class="calibre8">Apply</strong> button:</p><div><img src="img/00019.jpeg" alt="Proxy" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p></div></div>
