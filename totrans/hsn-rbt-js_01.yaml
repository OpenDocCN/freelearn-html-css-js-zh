    Uno with Node.js, and formed a library around it called Johnny-Five. Since then,
    the Johnny-Five library has grown to over 100 contributors, and can control over
    40 platforms, including the Raspberry Pi! It can also control many kinds of sensors
    and peripherals that you can use to create the robotics project you've been dreaming
    of in Node.js!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the ways the Johnny-Five library has grown to support so many platforms
    is by creating what are called IO plugins. You create an IO plugin for each type
    of board you wish to control. For example, we will be installing and using the
    Raspi-IO plugin to use Johnny-Five with the Raspberry Pi.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What is great about this system is that the code you write in this book can
    be used on any other platform that Johnny-Five supports (you just need to change
    PIN numbers)! Writing code for Node.js botnets is much easier when you're using
    the same APIs for any devices you might use.

    a microcontroller. It has dozens of GPIO pins and can be used to interface with
    many physical peripherals in order to achieve specialized tasks. The low cost
    and small size allows the Raspberry Pi to be a versatile device, but the power
    involved allows you to use it for tasks that other microcontrollers may not pack
    the punch for.

    it can also be used as a fully fledged computer! While it certainly isn't the
    most powerful hardware, with full Raspbian installed, a Raspberry Pi attached
    to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse creates a great machine for kids and adults
    to learn programming on! The original intent of the Raspberry Pi was to create
    a low-cost educational machine to teach programming, and it exceeded every expectation
    in that regard. The fact that it's also a great microcontroller for the world
    of makers is a great bonus!

    machine for its size, but with so many options, it can be hard to figure out where
    to get started. Luckily, we have a plan that will walk you through your first
    Raspberry Pi and Johnny-Five projects so that you can keep up, but which will

    Pi is both a microcontroller and a computer. We'll use the Linux operating system,
    via the Raspbian distribution, and leverage it to run our projects in Node.js.
    We'll also use Johnny-Five and Raspi-IO to leverage the GPIO of the Raspberry
    Pi in order to create robotics projects in a way that makes the code easy to understand
    and portable to many different hardware platforms.

    even scripting languages, such as subsets of Python and JavaScript.

    Node.js and Johnny-Five, we can use event emitters and systems, which fit in surprisingly
    well as they can read sensors and interact with peripherals in the real world,
    where things take time. This will help you to organize code in a way that reflects
    the asynchronous way the world works.'

    of 20K SRAM.'

    degrees of success because of the nonexistence of binaries for the ARM processor
    that Raspberry Pi uses. Luckily now, because of a rousing amount of third-party
    support in the past few years, you can easily download the binary from the [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    website! But how are we going to do this from the command line of our Raspberry
    Pi?

    taken a very long time ago, and because that is the case, and because `sudo apt-get
    install nodejs` is outdated (at the time of writing, using this command will install `v4` when
    we need `v8+`, if it installs Node.js at all), we need to download the binaries
