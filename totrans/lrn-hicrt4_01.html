This includes a short history of how web charts used to be made before Ajax and HTML5 became the new standard. The recent advances in JavaScript programming will be briefly discussed. Then, SVG support and the new HTML5 feature canvas, the main drive behind JavaScript charts, are introduced and demonstrated. This is followed by a quick guide to the other JavaScript graphing packages that are available on the market. Finally, we are introduced to Highcharts and will explain the advantages of using Highcharts over other products. In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A short history of web charting</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The rise of JavaScript and HTML5</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">JavaScript charts on the market</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Why Highcharts?</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="A short history of web charting"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec08"/>A short history of web charting</h1></div></div></div><p>Before diving into <a id="id0" class="indexterm"/>Highcharts, it is worth mentioning how web charts evolved from pure HTML with server-side technology to the current client side.</p><div class="section" title="HTML image map (server-side technology)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec07"/>HTML image map (server-side technology)</h2></div></div></div><p>This technique has been used <a id="id1" class="indexterm"/>since the early days of HTML, when server-side operations were the main drive. Charts were only HTML images generated from the web server. Before there were any server-side scripting languages such as PHP, one of the most common approaches was to use<a id="id2" class="indexterm"/> <span class="strong"><strong>Common Gateway Interface</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>CGI</strong></span>), which executes plotting programs (such as gnuplot) to output images. Later, when PHP became popular, the GD graphic module was used for plotting. One product that uses this technique is <a id="id3" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>JpGraph</strong></span>.</p><p>The following is an example of how to include a chart image in an HTML page:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;img src="pie_chart.php" border=0 align="left"&gt;</pre></div><p>The chart script <a id="id4" class="indexterm"/>file <code class="literal">pie_chart.php</code> is embedded in an HTML <code class="literal">img</code> tag. When <a id="id5" class="indexterm"/>the page is loaded, the browser sees the <code class="literal">img src</code> attribute and sends an HTTP request for <code class="literal">pie_chart.php</code>. As far as the web browser is concerned, it has no knowledge of whether the <code class="literal">.php</code> file is an image file or not. When the web server (with PHP support) receives the request, it recognizes the <code class="literal">.php</code> extension and executes the PHP scripts. The following is a cut down JpGraph example; the script outputs the image content and streams it back as an HTTP response, in the same way as normal image content would be sent back:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">// Create new graph
$graph = new Graph(350, 250);
// Add data points in array of x-axis and y-axis values
$p1 = new LinePlot($datay,$datax);
$graph-&gt;Add($p1);
// Output line chart in image format back to the client
$graph-&gt;Stroke();</pre></div><p>Furthermore, this technology combines with an HTML <code class="literal">map</code> tag for chart navigation, so that, when users click on a certain area of a graph, for example a slice in a pie chart, it can load a new page with another graph.</p><p>This technology has the following <a id="id6" class="indexterm"/>advantages:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Ideal for automation tasks, for example scheduled reports or e-mail alerts with the graph attached.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Doesn't require JavaScript. It is robust, pure HTML, and is light on the client side.</li></ul></div><p>It has the following<a id="id7" class="indexterm"/> disadvantages:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">More workload on the server side</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Pure HTML and a limited technology—few interactions can be put on the graphs and none on the animations</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Java applet (client-side) and servlet (server-side)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec08"/>Java applet (client-side) and servlet (server-side)</h2></div></div></div><p>A Java applet enables the <a id="id8" class="indexterm"/>web browser to execute multiplatform Java bytecode<a id="id9" class="indexterm"/> to achieve what HTML cannot do, such as graphics display, animations, and advanced user interactions. This was the first technology to extend traditional server-based work to the client side. To include a Java applet in an HTML page, HTML's <code class="literal">applet</code> (deprecated) or <code class="literal">object</code> tags are used and require a Java plugin to be installed for the browser.</p><p>The following is an example of including a Java applet inside an <code class="literal">object</code> tag. As Java does not run in the same environment in Internet Explorer as in other browsers, the conditional comments for IE were used:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;!--[if !IE]&gt; Non Internet Explorer way of loading applet --&gt;
&lt;object classid="Java:chart.class" type="application/x-java-applet"
 height="300" width="550" &gt;
&lt;!--&lt;![endif] Internet way of loading applet --&gt;
  &lt;object classid="clsid:8AD9C840..." codebase="/classes/"&gt;
  &lt;param name="code" value="chart.class" /&gt;
  &lt;/object&gt;
&lt;!--[if !IE]&gt; --&gt;
&lt;/object&gt;
&lt;!--&lt;![endif]--&gt; </pre></div><p>Generally, the Java 2D chart products are built from the <code class="literal">java.awt.Graphics2D</code> class and the <code class="literal">java.awt.geom</code> package from Java <a id="id10" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Abstract Window Toolkit</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>AWT</strong></span>). Then, the main chart library allows the users to utilize it in a browser, extending from<a id="id11" class="indexterm"/> the <code class="literal">Applet</code> class, or to run it on the server side, extending<a id="id12" class="indexterm"/> from the <code class="literal">Servlet</code> class.</p><p>An example of a Java product is<a id="id13" class="indexterm"/> <span class="strong"><strong>JFreeChart</strong></span>. It comes with 2D and 3D solutions and is free for nonprofit use. JFreeChart can be run as an applet, servlet, or standalone application. The following shows part of the code used to plot data points within an applet:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">public class AppletGraph extends JApplet {
  // Create X and Y axis plot dataset and populate
  // with data.
  XYPlot xyPlot = new XYPlot(); 
  xyPlot.setDataset(defaultXYDataset);
  CombinedDomainXYPlot combinedDomainXYPlot = 
    new CombinedDomainXYPlot();
  combinedDomainXYPlot.add(xyPlot);
  // Create a jFreeChart object with the dataset 
  JFreeChart jFreeChart = new JFreeChart(combinedDomainXYPlot);
  // Put the jFreeChart in a chartPanel 
  ChartPanel chartPanel = new ChartPanel(jFreeChart);
  chartPanel.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(900,600));
  // Add the chart panel into the display
  getContentPane().add(chartPanel);
}</pre></div><p>To run a chart application on the server side, a servlet container is needed—for example Apache Tomcat. The standard <code class="literal">web.xml</code> file is defined to bind a URL to a servlet:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;web-app id="server_charts" version="2.4"  
  xsi:schemaLocation="..."&gt;
  &lt;servlet&gt;
    &lt;servlet-name&gt;PieChartServlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
    &lt;servlet-class&gt;charts.PieChartServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt;
  &lt;/servlet&gt;
  &lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
    &lt;servlet-name&gt;PieChartServlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
    &lt;url-pattern&gt;/servlets/piechart&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
  &lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;
&lt;/web-app&gt;</pre></div><p>When the servlet container, such as Tomcat, receives an HTTP request with the URL <code class="literal">http://localhost/servlets/piechart</code>, it resolves the request into a servlet application. The web server then executes the chart servlet, formats the output into an image, and returns the image content as an HTTP response.</p><p>This technology<a id="id14" class="indexterm"/> has the following <a id="id15" class="indexterm"/>advantages:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Advanced graphics, animations, and user interfaces</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Reusable core code for different deployment options: client-side, server-side, or standalone applications</li></ul></div><p>It has the<a id="id16" class="indexterm"/> following<a id="id17" class="indexterm"/> disadvantages:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Applet security issues</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">If the plugin crashes, it can hang or crash the browser</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Very CPU intensive</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Requires a Java plugin</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Long startup time</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Standardization problems</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" title="Adobe Shockwave Flash (client-side)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec09"/>Adobe Shockwave Flash (client-side)</h2></div></div></div><p>Flash is widely used <a id="id18" class="indexterm"/>because it offers audio, graphics, animation, and video capabilities on web browsers. Browsers are required to have the Adobe Flash Player plugin installed. As for plotting graphs, this technique was a common choice (because there weren't many other options) before the HTML5 standard became popular.</p><p>Graphing software adopting this technology ships with its own exported <span class="strong"><strong>Shockwave Flash</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>SWF</strong></span>) files. These SWF files contain compressed vector-based graphics and compiled ActionScript instructions to create a chart. In order for the Flash Player to display the graphs, the SWF file has to be loaded from an HTML page. To do that, an HTML <code class="literal">object</code> tag is needed. The tag is internally created and injected into the document's DOM by the software's own JavaScript routines.</p><p>Inside this <code class="literal">object</code> tag is dimension and SWF path information for plotting the graph. The graph variable data is also passed inside this tag. So, as soon as the browser sees an <code class="literal">object</code> tag with specific parameters, it calls the installed Flash Player to process both the SWF file and the parameters. To pass the graph's plot data from the server side to the client-side Flash Player, <code class="literal">flashVars</code> is embedded inside a <code class="literal">param</code> tag with the data type. The following is an example from Yahoo YUI 2:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;object id="yuiswf1" type="..." data="charts.swf" width="100%" height="100%"&gt;

<div class="section" title="The rise of JavaScript and HTML5"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec09"/>The rise of JavaScript and HTML5</h1></div></div></div><p>The role of<a id="id21" class="indexterm"/> JavaScript has shifted significantly from a few simple client routines to a dominant language to create and manage web user interfaces. The programming technique has moved towards object-oriented with the introduction of function object, prototype, and closure. This was driven by a group of pioneers such as Douglas Crockford, who was responsible for transforming the language to educate and make JavaScript a better language with his book <span class="emphasis"><em>JavaScript: The Good Parts</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>O'Reilly Media / Yahoo Press</em></span>  Others include Sam Stephenson, creator of the Prototype JavaScript library<a id="id22" class="indexterm"/> (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.prototypejs.org">http://www.prototypejs.org</a>), and John Resig, creator of the <a id="id23" class="indexterm"/>JQuery library (<a class="ulink" href="http://jquery.com">http://jquery.com</a>), who brought JavaScript into a framework for building more complicated frontend web software.</p><p>It is beyond the scope of this book to give an introduction to this new programming style. Readers are expected to know the basics of jQuery and CSS selector syntax, which are used in some of the chapters. Readers should also be familiar with the advanced JavaScript scripting described in the book <span class="emphasis"><em>JavaScript: The Good Parts</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>O'Reilly Media / Yahoo Press</em></span>, such as prototypes, closure, inheritance, and function objects.</p><div class="section" title="HTML5 (SVG and Canvas)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec10"/>HTML5 (SVG and Canvas)</h2></div></div></div><p>In this <a id="id24" class="indexterm"/>section, two HTML5 technologies, SVG and Canvas, are covered, along with examples.</p><div class="section" title="SVG"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec01"/>SVG</h3></div></div></div><p>HTML5<a id="id25" class="indexterm"/> is the biggest advance so far in the HTML standard. The adoption of the standard is growing fast (also fuelled by Apple mobile devices, which stopped supporting Adobe Flash). Again, it is beyond the scope of this book to cover them. However, the most relevant part to web charting is <span class="strong"><strong>Scalable Vector Graphics</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>SVG</strong></span>). SVG<a id="id26" class="indexterm"/> is an XML format for describing vector-based graphics  that is composed of components such as paths, text, shapes, color, and so on. The technology is similar to PostScript, except that PostScript is a stack-based language. As implied by its name, one of the major advantages of SVG is that it is a lossless technology (the same as PostScript): it doesn't suffer from any pixelation effects by enlarging the image. A reduced image size will not suffer from loss of original content.</p><p>Furthermore, SVG can be scripted with timing animation <span class="strong"><strong>Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>SMIL</strong></span>)<a id="id27" class="indexterm"/> and event handling. Apart from IE, this SVG technology is supported by all mainstream <a id="id28" class="indexterm"/>browsers, <a class="ulink" href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=svg-smil">http://caniuse.com/#feat=svg-smil</a>.</p><p>The following is a simple example of SVG code showing a single curved line between two points:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;svg  version="1.1"&gt;
  &lt;path id="curveAB" d="M 100 350 q 150 -300 300 0" stroke="blue" stroke-width="5" fill="none" /&gt;
  &lt;!-- Mark relevant points --&gt;
  &lt;g stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="black"&gt;
    &lt;circle id="pointA" cx="100" cy="350" r="3" /&gt;
    &lt;circle id="pointB" cx="400" cy="350" r="3" /&gt;
  &lt;/g&gt;
  &lt;!-- Label the points --&gt;

    &lt;text x="400" y="350" dx="30"&gt;B&lt;/text&gt;
  &lt;/g&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;</pre></div><p>The preceding<a id="id29" class="indexterm"/> SVG code <a id="id30" class="indexterm"/>is executed in the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Draw a path with <code class="literal">id="curveAB"</code> with data (<code class="literal">d</code>). First, move <code class="literal">M</code> to an absolute coordinate (<code class="literal">100</code>, <code class="literal">350</code>), then draw a Bézier quadratic curve from the current position to (<code class="literal">150</code>, <code class="literal">-300</code>) and finish at (<code class="literal">300</code>, <code class="literal">0</code>).</li><li class="listitem">Group (<code class="literal">g</code>) the two circle elements—<code class="literal">"pointA"</code> and <code class="literal">"pointB"</code>—with the center coordinates (<code class="literal">100</code>, <code class="literal">350</code>) and (<code class="literal">400</code>, <code class="literal">350</code>) respectively with a radius of <code class="literal">3</code> pixels. Then fill both circles in black.</li><li class="listitem">Group the two text elements <code class="literal">A</code> and <code class="literal">B</code>, started at (<code class="literal">100</code>, <code class="literal">350</code>) and (<code class="literal">400</code>, <code class="literal">350</code>), which display with the sans-serif font in black, and then shift along the x-axis (dx) <code class="literal">30</code> pixels left and right, respectively.</li></ol></div><p>The following is the final graph from the SVG script:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/7451OS_01_01.jpg" alt="SVG"/></div></div><div class="section" title="Canvas"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec02"/>Canvas</h3></div></div></div><p>Canvas<a id="id31" class="indexterm"/> is another<a id="id32" class="indexterm"/> new HTML5 standard  that is used by some JavaScript chart software packages. The purpose of Canvas is as its name implies; you declare a drawing area on the <code class="literal">canvas</code> tag, then use the new JavaScript APIs to draw lines and shapes in pixels. This is the distinct difference between the two techniques: Canvas is pixel-based, whereas SVG is vector-based. Canvas has no built-in animation routine, so API calls in timed sequences are used to simulate an animation. Also, there is no event-handling support, so developers need to manually attach event handlers to certain regions on the canvas. Fancy chart animation may prove more complicated to implement.</p><p>The following is an example of Canvas code that achieves the same effect as the preceding SVG curve:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;canvas id="myCanvas" width="500" height="300" style="border:1px solid #d3d3d3;"&gt;Canvas tag not supported&lt;/canvas&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    var c=document.getElementById("myCanvas");
   var ctx=c.getContext("2d");
  // Draw the quadratic curve from Point A to B
   ctx.beginPath();
   ctx.moveTo(100, 250);
   ctx.quadraticCurveTo(250, 0, 400, 250);
   ctx.strokeStyle="blue";
   ctx.lineWidth=5;
   ctx.stroke();
  // Draw a black circle attached to the start of the curve
   ctx.fillStyle="black";
   ctx.strokeStyle="black";
   ctx.lineWidth=3;
   ctx.beginPath();
   ctx.arc(100,250,3, 0, 2* Math.PI);
   ctx.stroke();
   ctx.fill();
  // Draw a black circle attached to the end of the curve
   ctx.beginPath();
   ctx.arc(400,250,3, 0, 2* Math.PI);
   ctx.stroke();
   ctx.fill();
  // Display 'A' and 'B' text next to the points
   ctx.font="30px 'sans-serif'";
   ctx.textAlign="center";
   ctx.fillText("A", 70, 250);
   ctx.fillText("B", 430, 250);
&lt;/script&gt; </pre></div><p>As you can see, both <a id="id33" class="indexterm"/>canvas and <a id="id34" class="indexterm"/>SVG can do the same task, but Canvas requires more instructions:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/7451OS_01_02.jpg" alt="Canvas"/></div><p>Instead of a continuous path description in SVG, a sequence of JavaScript drawing methods is called. The preceding <a id="id35" class="indexterm"/>Canvas code follows these steps to draw the curve:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">In the preceding example, it<a id="id36" class="indexterm"/> first calls <code class="literal">beginPath</code> to start a path in the canvas, then issues the <code class="literal">moveTo</code> call to move the path starting point to the coordinate (<code class="literal">100, 250</code>) without creating a line. The <code class="literal">quadraticCurveTo</code> method creates the curve path from the <code class="literal">moveTo</code> location to the top of the curve and the end point, which is (<code class="literal">400, 250</code>). Once the path is set up, we set up the stroke properties before calling the <code class="literal">stroke</code> method to draw the line along the path.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">We call <code class="literal">beginPath</code> to reset to a new path to draw and invoke the <code class="literal">arc</code> method to create a tiny circular path at both the start and end coordinates of the curve path. Once we have set up the stroke and fill styles, we call the <code class="literal">fill</code> and <code class="literal">stroke</code> routines to fill it black, to act as a coordinate marker.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Finally, we set up the font properties and create the text <code class="literal">A</code> and <code class="literal">B</code> by calling <code class="literal">fillText</code> with the position near the coordinate markers.</li></ul></div><p>In a nutshell, instead of a single tag with multiple attributes as in SVG, Canvas adopts multiple attribute-setting routines. SVG is mostly declarative, while Canvas enforces an imperative programming approach.</p></div></div></div>

Here, a handful of commercial and open source products are discussed, including all the basic charts and some with extras. Some of them still support the Flash plugin, which is an option for backwards-compatibility because SVG and canvas are not supported in older browsers. Although some of them are not free for commercial development, which is understandable, they are very affordable.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note02"/>Note</h3><p>See <a class="ulink" href="http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/">http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/</a>.

Ext JS 4 comes with a pure JavaScript charts library, unlike its predecessor Ext JS 3 that used the YUI 2 Flash chart library. As the market trend is moving away from Adobe Flash, Sencha responded with a home-brew charting library. Ext JS 4 covers all the basic 2D charts plus gauge and radar charts, and all the charts support animations. The license is free for open source and noncommercial usage, but a developer license is needed for commercial development. One great benefit of Ext JS charts is that integration with a comprehensive set of UI components, for example for a chart with a storage framework, makes displaying/updating both the chart and the table of data very simple to do with editors.</p><p>In Ext JS 5, the charting library has been completely restructured. Appearance is a major step forward compared to Ext JS 4: the charts look much more professionally done and on a par with other competitors. Although the Ext JS 5 chart layout, color, and animations may not be as stylish and smooth as Highcharts, it is a close call and still well-received.</p><div class="section" title="Data Driven Documents"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec03"/>Data Driven Documents</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Data Driven Documents</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>D3</strong></span>)<a id="id42" class="indexterm"/> is the most widely-used charting library.

In other words, it is a decorative framework to manipulate selected elements, known as <span class="emphasis"><em>selections</em></span>, through a myriad of APIs. These APIs allow users to join the selections with chart data and style them like CSS or apply specific effects. This approach enables D3 to create a wide variety of impressive charts with animations that other products cannot produce. It is an ideal tool for plotting specific scientific graphs, or graphs that require complex data visualization presentation, such as Hierarchical Edge Bundling.</p><p>The software is free for <a id="id44" class="indexterm"/>commercial use and has attracted a large user base<a id="id45" class="indexterm"/> and contribution from user communities, especially from the academic sector.</p><p>Due to its highly programmable and comparatively low-level approach, it requires a much steeper learning curve that may not appeal to less technical users or developers looking for a chart-ready solution on a production level. As for constructing 3D charts in D3, it can be a challenging task. Although D3 trumps in performance, control, and presentation, it is not for everyone.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="FusionCharts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec13"/>FusionCharts</h2></div></div></div><p>FusionCharts<a id="id46" class="indexterm"/> is probably one of the most impressive-looking tools, and has the most comprehensive range of charts on the market. Not only does it come with a full variety of interesting 2D charts (radar, dial, map, and candlestick) available as a separate product, but it also offers fully interactive 3D charts. All the chart animations are very professionally done. FusionCharts can be run in two modes: Flash or JavaScript. Although FusionCharts comes with a higher price tag, it offers the best looking charts bundled with rotatable, animated 3D charts in column, pie, funnel, and pyramid series.</p></div><div class="section" title="Raphaël"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec14"/>Raphaël</h2></div></div></div><p>Raphaël<a id="id47" class="indexterm"/> is another free graphics library. It supports both SVG and VML for earlier browsers. It is designed like a generic graphics library, handling SVG elements, but it can be used as a charting solution. The software offers APIs to create a Canvas-like object, paper, that users can then create basic shapes or line SVG elements in. The API construct is somewhat similar to D3 in the sense that it can bind data into elements and manipulate them, but with rather more primitive methods, whereas D3 is a data-centric solution. The documentation is basic and it has a smaller user community. Like D3, it requires more effort to program a presentable chart than Highcharts and is not an ideal choice for 3D chart solutions.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Why Highcharts?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec11"/>Why Highcharts?</h1></div></div></div><p>Highcharts <a id="id48" class="indexterm"/>offers very appealing and professional-looking 2D/3D charts on the market. It is a product that stands out by paying attention to details, not only on the presentation side, but also in other areas that are described later on. It was developed by a Norwegian company called Highsoft AS, created and founded by Torstein Hønsi, and released in late 2009. Highcharts is not their first product, but is by far their best-selling one.</p><div class="section" title="Highcharts and JavaScript frameworks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec15"/>Highcharts and JavaScript frameworks</h2></div></div></div><p>Although Highcharts is built <a id="id49" class="indexterm"/>with the JavaScript framework library, it is<a id="id50" class="indexterm"/> implemented in such a way that it doesn't <a id="id51" class="indexterm"/>totally rely on one particular framework. Highcharts is packaged with adapters to make its interfaces to frameworks pluggable.</p><p>As a result, Highcharts can be incorporated with MooTools, Prototype, or jQuery JavaScript frameworks. Highcharts also has a standalone framework for those who write in pure JavaScript. This empowers users without compromising their already-developed product, or allows them to decide to use the framework that is best suited for their projects.  Users who develop their web charting applications in jQuery are only required to load the jQuery library before Highcharts.</p><p>To use Highcharts in the MooTools environment, users simply do the following:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/mootools/1.4.5/mootools-yui-compressed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" 
        src="http://code.highcharts.com/adapters/mootools-adapter.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" 
        src="http://code.highcharts.com/highcharts.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre></div><p>To use Highcharts under Prototype, users need to do the following:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/prototype/1.7.1.0/prototype.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" 
        src="http://code.highcharts.com/adapters/prototype-adapter.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" 
        src="http://code.highcharts.com/highcharts.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  </pre></div></div><div class="section" title="Presentation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec16"/>Presentation</h2></div></div></div><p>Highcharts<a id="id52" class="indexterm"/> strikes <a id="id53" class="indexterm"/>the right balance of look and feel. The charts themselves are visually pleasant and yet the style is simple. The default choices of color are soothing without a sharp contrast and don't conflict with each other, aided by the subtle shadow and white border effects. None of the text nor the colors of the axes are in black or any dark color, which keeps the viewer's attention centered on the colored data presentation. The following is an example of a Highcharts representation:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/7451OS_01_03.jpg" alt="Presentation"/></div><p>All the animations (initial, update, tool tip) in Highcharts are finely tuned: smooth with a gradual slowdown motion. The initial animation of the donut chart, which is a multi-series pie chart, is the most impressive one. This is the area in which Highcharts is clearly better. The animations in other charts are too mechanical, too much, and sometimes off-putting:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/7451OS_01_04.jpg" alt="Presentation"/></div><p>The round corners of tool tips and legends (both inner and outer) with a simple border do not fight for the viewer's attention and nicely blend into the chart. The following is a tool tip sample:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/7451OS_01_05.jpg" alt="Presentation"/></div><p>The following is<a id="id54" class="indexterm"/> a legend example with two series:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/7451OS_01_06.jpg" alt="Presentation"/></div><p>In a nutshell, each element in <a id="id55" class="indexterm"/>Highcharts does not compete with others for the viewer's attention, so they share the load equally and work together as a chart.</p></div><div class="section" title="License"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec17"/>License</h2></div></div></div><p>Highcharts has free noncommercial as well as<a id="id56" class="indexterm"/> commercial licenses. The free license for personal and nonprofit purposes is <a id="id57" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Creative Commons – Attribution Noncommercial 3.0</strong></span>. Highcharts offers different flavors of commercial license for different purposes. They have a one-off single website license and, thankfully, a developer license. For web development products, a developer license is a better model than charging in units of website use or a very high-priced OEM license because of the following reasons:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It is easier for software companies to work out the math in their development plans</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">There is less worry regarding how many copies are being sold, so as not to violate the license</li></ul></div><p>As usual, a developer license does not automatically grant the use of Highcharts indefinitely. The license only permits the unlimited use of all the versions released within a year from the license purchase date. Thereafter, a brand new license is required if developers decide to use a newer version. Moreover, any condition can be negotiated for the OEM license, and the quote is usually based on the number of developers on the project and the number of deployments.</p></div><div class="section" title="Simple API model"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec18"/>Simple API model</h2></div></div></div><p>Highcharts<a id="id58" class="indexterm"/> has a very simple API<a id="id59" class="indexterm"/> model. To create a chart, the constructor API expects an object specifier with all the necessary settings. To dynamically update an existing chart, Highcharts comes with a small set of APIs. The configuration properties are described in detail in <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Highcharts Configurations">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Highcharts Configurations</em></span>.

It is not just a simple documentation page that dumps all the definitions and examples. It's a documentation page built with thought.</p><p>The left-hand side of the documentation page is organized in an object structure, as you would pass it to create a chart. You can further expand and collapse the object's attributes as in a JavaScript console. This helps users to become familiar with the product by using it naturally:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/7451OS_01_07.jpg" alt="Documentations"/></div><p>The well-thought-out part of the documentation is on the right-hand side with the definitions of attributes.

Users can submit new feature requests and then vote for them. The company then reviews the feature requests with the most votes and draws up a development plan that includes the new features. The details of the plan are then published on the Highcharts website.</p><p>In addition, Highcharts is hosted on <a id="id63" class="indexterm"/>GitHub, an online public source control service, which allows JavaScript developers to contribute and clone their own versions:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/7451OS_01_09.jpg" alt="Openness (feature request with user voice)"/></div></div></div>

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre></div><p>The spline graph is created<a id="id80" class="indexterm"/> via an object specifier that contains all the properties and series data required. Once the <code class="literal">chart</code> object is created, the graph is displayed in the browser. Within this object specifier, there are major components corresponding to the structure of the chart:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">var chart = new HighCharts.Chart({ 
    chart: {
        ...
    },
    title: '...'
    ... 
});</pre></div><p>The <code class="literal">renderTo</code> option instructs Highcharts to display the graph onto the HTML <code class="literal">&lt;div&gt;</code> element with <code class="literal">'container'</code> as the ID value, which is defined in the HTML <code class="literal">&lt;body&gt;</code> section. The <code class="literal">type</code> option is set to the default presentation type as <code class="literal">'spline'</code> for any series data, as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">chart: {
    renderTo: 'container',
    type: 'spline'
}</pre></div><p>Next is to set <code class="literal">title</code> and <code class="literal">subtitle</code>, which appear in the center at the top of the chart:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">title: {
   text: 'Web browsers ... '
},
subtitle: {
   text: 'From 2008 to present'
},</pre></div><p>The <code class="literal">categories</code> option in the <code class="literal">xAxis</code> property contains an array of x-axis labels for each data point. Since the graph has at least 50 data points, printing each x-axis label will make the text overlap. Rotating the labels still results in the axis looking very packed. The best compromise is to print every third label, (<code class="literal">tickIntervals: 3</code>), which makes the labels nicely spaced out from each other.</p><p>For the sake of simplicity, we use 50 entries in <code class="literal">xAxis.categories</code> to represent the time. However, we will see a more optimal and logical way to display date and time data in the next chapter:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">xAxis: {
   categories: [ 'Jan 2008', 'Feb', .... ],
   tickInterval: 3
},</pre></div><p>The options in <code class="literal">yAxis</code> are to assign the title of the y-axis and set the minimum possible value to zero; otherwise, Highcharts will display a negative percentage range along the y-axis, which is not wanted for this data set:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">yAxis: {
     title: {
         text: 'Percentage %'
     },
     min: 0
},</pre></div><p>The <code class="literal">plotOptions</code> property<a id="id81" class="indexterm"/> is to control how each series is displayed, according to its type (line, pie, bar, and so on). The <code class="literal">plotOptions.series</code> option is the general configuration applied to all the series types instead of defining each setting inside the <code class="literal">series</code> array. In this example, the default <code class="literal">linewidth</code> for every series is set to <code class="literal">2</code>-pixels wide, as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"> plotOptions: {
    series: {
        lineWidth: 2
    }
},</pre></div><p>The <code class="literal">series</code> property is the heart of the whole configuration object that defines all the series data. It is an array of the <code class="literal">series</code> object. The <code class="literal">series</code> object can be specified in multiple ways. For this example, the name is the name of the series that appears in the chart legend and tool tip. The data is an array of y-axis values that have the same length as the <code class="literal">xAxis.categories</code> array, to form (x,y) data points:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">series: [{
     name: 'Internet Explorer',

Among these, Highcharts emerged with a distinct graphical style and smooth user interactions. We also went through a simple chart example to experience how quick and easy it is to create our very first Highcharts chart.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will explore the Highcharts configuration object in greater detail with plenty more examples.
