- en: Over the past decade, the JavaScript code base of an average web application
    has been growing exponentially. However, the current version of JavaScript was
    designed several years ago and lacks some features necessary to cope with the
    level of complexity that we may find in a modern JavaScript application. Owing
    to these missing features, maintainability problems have arisen.

- en: The **ECMAScript 2015** specification is meant to solve some of the maintainability
    issues of JavaScript, but its implementation is in progress, and many incompatible
    web browsers are still in use today. For these reasons, wide adoption of the **ECMAScript
    2015** specification is expected to be a slow process.

- en: '"We designed TypeScript to meet the needs of the JavaScript programming teams
    that build and maintain large JavaScript programs. TypeScript helps programming
    teams to define interfaces between software components and to gain insight into
    the behavior of existing JavaScript libraries. TypeScript also enables teams to
    reduce naming conflicts by organizing their code into dynamically loadable modules.
    TypeScript’s optional type system enables JavaScript programmers to use highly-productive
    development tools and practices: static checking, symbol-based navigation, statement
    completion, and code refactoring."'

- en: Some developers with many years, experience in web development will find it
    challenging to define a large-scale JavaScript application. When referring to
    this term, we will avoid considering the number of lines of code in the application.
    It is much better to consider the number of modules and entities in an application,
    and the number of dependencies between them as units of measurement of the application’s
    scale. We will define large-scale applications as nontrivial applications that
    require significant developer effort to be maintained.

- en: '*Learning TypeScript 2.x Second Edition,* introduces many of the TypeScript
    features in a simple and easy-to-understand format. This book will teach you everything
    you need to know to implement a large-scale JavaScript application using TypeScript.
    Not only does it teach TypeScript’s core features, which are essential to implement
    a web application, but it also explores some powerful development tools, design
    principles, and good practices, and demonstrates how to apply them to real-life
    applications.'

    that cover topics such as functional programming, advanced type system features,
    an introduction to frontend development with React and Angular, an introduction
    to Node.js development, and an introduction to the internal APIs of the TypeScript
    compiler.
