- en: ServiceNow is gradually evolving as the platform of choice for IT Service management.
    Industry giants such as RedHat and NetApp have adopted ServiceNow for their operational
    needs. ServiceNow provides clients with an extra add-on when it comes to their
    baseline instances, as scripting can be used to customize and improve the performance
    of their instances. ServiceNow provides inbuilt JavaScript API for scripting and
    improving an instance using JavaScript.

- en: This book will initially cover the basics of ServiceNow scripting and the appropriate
    time to script in a ServiceNow environment. Then, we will dig deeper into client-side
    and server-side scripting using JavaScipt API. We will also cover advanced concepts
    such as on-demand functions, script actions, and best practices. This book will
    act as an end-to-end guide to writing, testing, and debugging scripts in ServiceNow.
    We will also cover update sets for moving customizations between ServiceNow instances,
    Jelly scripts for making custom pages, and best practices for all types of script
    in ServiceNow.

    examples and create some scripts of your own. If you do not have an instance at
    this point, personal developer instances (PDI's) can be requested from ServiceNow
    for users who would like to improve their ServiceNow skills.
