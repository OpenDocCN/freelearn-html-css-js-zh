    in mind: to take you from zero to deployment as quickly as possible while building
    a real application that reinforces the lessons from every chapter.'

- en: Node.js has been a leading technology for many years, and while there are numerous
    resources available to learn from, this book takes a unique approach. The knowledge
    you gain here will remain relevant even if you decide to change parts of your
    tech stack. Let me illustrate this now with an example.

- en: Throughout the book, we use MongoDB, a non-relational database, to build our
    project. You might wonder how to adapt the project if you prefer using PostgreSQL,
    for instance. The approach I’ve taken in writing this book will make such transitions
    smoother. You’ll have unit tests and a clear interface to manage these changes
    seamlessly. I wrote a dedicated chapter to introduce testing with the Node.js
    API and using third party libraries such as *Jest* or *supertest* and we integrate
    tests as a security net that allows us to refactor the code without fear.
