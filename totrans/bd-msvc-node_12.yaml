  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Compensating actions** are used to undo the effects of a failed operation
    in a microservices architecture. They are often needed when an operation consists
    of multiple steps that are eventually consistent, meaning that the system might
    be in an inconsistent state until all steps are completed. If one or more of the
    steps fail, the system should revert to a consistent state by applying compensating
    actions that revert changes made by the previous steps. For example, if an operation
    involves reserving a hotel room, booking a flight, and charging a credit card,
    and the flight booking fails, the compensating actions would be to cancel the
    hotel reservation and refund the credit card. Compensating actions are usually
    implemented as separate transactions triggered by an error or a timeout. They
    can also be idempotent, meaning that they can be executed multiple times without
    changing the outcome.'

- en: Let’s take a look at one of the most common use cases of compensating actions.
    In microservices, compensating actions are crucial when a complex transaction
    involves multiple steps across different services, and a failure occurs at any
    point. Instead of rolling back the entire transaction, compensating actions are
    triggered to revert changes made during the transaction.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, consider an e-commerce system where a user places an order and
    several microservices are involved (order creation, inventory deduction, payment
    processing). If payment fails, compensating actions might involve canceling the
    order, adding inventory back, and refunding the user.

    examples of failure scenarios are the following:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of times or until a timeout is reached, in case of transient failures or network
    delays. The retry mechanism should also handle idempotency and concurrency issues,
    such as using unique identifiers or version numbers to avoid duplicate or conflicting
    updates.'

  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Fallback mechanism**: The compensating action can have a fallback option
    that provides an alternative way to undo the original operation, in case of permanent
    failures or service unavailability. The fallback mechanism should also ensure
    data consistency and business logic correctness, such as using a manual process
    or a third-party service to perform the compensating action.'

    action in case of failure, forming a chain of compensations that eventually restores
    the system to a consistent state. The compensation chain should also avoid circular
    dependencies and infinite loops, such as using a termination condition or a maximum
    depth limit to stop the chain.'

    way to undo the previous operations in case of a failure. For example, if you’re
    creating an order and you’ve deducted an item from inventory, but the payment
    service fails due to some reason, you would want to compensate for the deducted
    item and add it back to the inventory. This undo operation is the compensating
    action.
