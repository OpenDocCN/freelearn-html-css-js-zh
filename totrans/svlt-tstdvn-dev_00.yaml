- en: 'What excites me about Svelte? Its simplicity, elegance, and pragmatic design
    ethos. Its growing success in the marketplace suggests that other programmers
    feel the same way too. I’m not surprised by this. When we write software for the
    JavaScript ecosystem, we have a choice: we can either accept and be consumed by
    the complexity of its primary constituents (React, Node.js, webpack, Babel, and
    so on) or we can actively seek out the marginalized products and processes that
    aim to simplify our work.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’ll be no surprise to you that I place **Test-Driven Development** (**TDD**)
    firmly in this second camp. Because without it, what you have is a development
    workflow that largely consists of chasing bugs and carrying a lot of context in
    your head. This is always what I think of as the *bad* *old days*.

- en: 'When I first started programming as a youngster, I remember the infuriating
    experience of debugging – writing some code, trying it out, finding bugs, and
    struggling for hours to figure out where the errors were hidden in my code. It
    seemed like a natural part of programming: devoting a large portion of my time
    to debugging. And this carried through into my first job as a C++ desktop application
    developer. (It wasn’t long before I discovered TDD and how it could help me have
    a simpler, quieter, calmer life.)'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then there’s the mental context you need when you plan out a grand design for
    the next feature you’re about to implement. You have to know where you’re at,
    what you’ve done, and what’s next, and do your best to not stray from the path.
    That’s hard when you’re being derailed by debugging and other distractions.

- en: Sure, you can write a to-do list or keep a diary, but why not write some automated
    tests instead? They not only remind you where you’re at but they check for bugs,
    too.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That is essentially the idea behind TDD.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if you like Svelte because it simplifies your life and makes you feel like
    you’re swimming rather than wading through mud, I think you’ll also like TDD.
    This book shows you the how and why of Svelte with TDD. I hope you enjoy it. Thanks
    for reading!

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re a Svelte programmer, this book is for you. I aim to show you how TDD
    can improve your work. If you’re already knowledgeable about TDD, I hope there’s
    still a lot you can learn from comparing your own process with mine.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you don’t already know Svelte, but you’re familiar with any modern frontend
    framework such as React, you should be able to follow along and pick things up
    as you go. TDD is a wonderful platform for explaining new technologies, and it’s
    entirely plausible that you’ll be able to pick up Svelte simply by following this
    book.
