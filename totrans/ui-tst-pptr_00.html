		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>Puppeteer is a multi-purpose browser automation tool created by Google. You will see Puppeteer being used in many different ways. It's used for web scraping, task automation, content generation, web monitoring, and UI testing.</p>
			<p>This book focuses on UI testing, but we won't stop there. For instance, we have a chapter focused on content generation and another chapter that focuses on web scraping. If you read this book from cover to cover, you will be able to use Puppeteer in all fields.</p>
			<p>When I found that there was no book about Puppeteer available on the market, that really motivated me: I wanted this book to cover the entire Puppeteer API. By the end of this book, you'll have learned about the whole Puppeteer API.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>If you are a quality assurance professional looking for a better and more modern tool to do your job, this is the book for you.</p>
			<p>These days, UI testing is not only for the QA team. There is a new wave of frontend developers looking for tools to test their UI components. If you are a web developer using JavaScript and Node.js in your daily job and you want to test your UI components, this book is also for you.</p>
			<p>Web developers will also learn from this book how to use browser automation tools to automate tasks such as taking screenshots, generating PDF files, or doing web scraping.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p><a href="B16113_01_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Getting started with Puppeteer</em>, lays the foundation for the book. It will help you get started with Puppeteer by introducing you to the tool and getting you acquainted with the essentials. You will also learn how to write async code in JavaScript.</p>
			<p><a href="B16113_02_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor038"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Automated Testing and Test runners</em>, covers end-to-end testing fundamentals and the difference between different types of tests. In the latter part of the chapter, we will cover creating and organizing a test project and getting started with test runners.</p>
			<p><a href="B16113_03_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor050"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Navigating through a website</em>, sees you start coding your tests. You will learn how to launch a browser, navigate to a page, and make some assertions. Then, you will see how to publish your tests to the cloud to be tested.</p>
			<p><a href="B16113_04_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor072"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Interacting with a page,</em> is all about interaction. Once you get to a page, how do you test it? How do you simulate user interaction? This chapter takes you through the most common ways of interacting with a page. This chapter also covers some basic HTML concepts, so you can take advantage of all the tools Puppeteer provides.</p>
			<p><a href="B16113_05_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor087"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Waiting for elements and network calls,</em> teaches you how to wait for the different scenarios on the page you are testing—waiting for the page to load and be ready, waiting for a button to be enabled, waiting for an Ajax call to be completed, and so on. This chapter covers all the tools that Puppeteer offers to handle these scenarios.</p>
			<p><a href="B16113_06_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor104"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Executing and Injecting JavaScript,</em> shows you one of the best features of Puppeteer: injecting JavaScript code easily. In this chapter, we will leave the end-to-end testing world for a moment and dive into web automation using a general-purpose tool.</p>
			<p><a href="B16113_07_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor130"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Generating Content with Puppeteer,</em> expands on the usage of Puppeteer and shows you how we can create content using Puppeteer. We'll start by learning how screenshots are created and how they can be used for regression tests. Then, we will cover PDF generation, and finally, we will learn how to create pages on the fly.</p>
			<p><a href="B16113_08_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor137"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Environments emulation,</em> explains all the tools Puppeteer provides to emulate different scenarios. It will show you how to emulate mobile devices, different screen resolutions, various network speeds, geolocation, and even things such as vision deficiency.</p>
			<p><a href="B16113_09_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor156"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Scraping tools,</em> demystifies web scraping, showing you how it can be used to your advantage. You will learn how to create scrapers and run tasks in parallel using Puppeteer Cluster.</p>
			<p><a href="B16113_10_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor167"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>,<em class="italic"> Evaluating and Improving the Performance of a Website,</em> shows you how Puppeteer can help developers to evaluate and improve the performance of their sites. We will learn how to extract and analyze all the performance metrics you can see on the Developer Tools. This chapter also has a great introduction to Google Lighthouse and how to automate its reports and integrate them into your tests.</p>
			<p>I also want this book to fill your toolbox with more tools besides Puppeteer. During the course of this book, you will learn about other tools, such as GitHub Actions, Visual Studio Code, Checkly and its Puppeteer recorder, and many others.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>This book assumes that you have some knowledge of JavaScript, but you don't need to be an expert. All the examples will run on Node.js. If you have experience with this framework, you will find it easier to get started. If you don't, don't worry; we won't go deep into Node.js<em class="italic">.</em></p>
			<p>All the tools we will use are cross-platform. You will be able to follow the code of this book using any popular operating system, such as Windows, macOS, or Linux. In <a href="B16113_01_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Getting started with Puppeteer</em>, we will see how to install Node.js and Visual Studio Code. If you already have these tools installed, notice that Puppeteer relies on Node 10.18.1+.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">If you are using the digital version of this book, we advise you to type the code yourself or access the code via the GitHub repository (link available in the next section). Doing so will help you avoid any potential errors related to the copying and pasting of code.</strong></p>

			<p>You can download the example code files for this book from GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/UI-Testing-with-Puppeteer">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/UI-Testing-with-Puppeteer</a>. In case there's an update to the code, it will be updated on the existing GitHub repository.</p>
			<p>We also have other code bundles from our rich catalog of books and videos available at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/</a>. Check them out!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-10"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/>Disclaimer</h1>
			<p>Many of the examples of this book will be based on real websites that most of us use every day. We are going to test websites like <a href="http://GitHub.com">GitHub.com</a>, <a href="http://StackOverlow.com">StackOverlow.com</a>, The Weather Channel, and PacktPub. That means that you will learn how to automate real websites using the latest technologies. However, this also means that some of the code examples might eventually fail. This could be due to network conditions, problems with the server, or a website redesign. However, our main aim is that you can learn the concepts and apply them to your own solutions besides these changes.</p>
