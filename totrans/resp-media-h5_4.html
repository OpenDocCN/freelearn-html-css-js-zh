Such questions must have definitely crossed your mind. Worry not! This chapter will guide you through some really cool testing techniques/methods.</p><p>Testing is a <a id="id216" class="indexterm"/>key part of the process of working with responsive media. We need to test our content thoroughly on a variety of different browsers, devices, and platforms to ensure we don't encounter any problems when our site is released to the wild.</p><p>It is possible you might think we need lots of specialist technology—nothing could be further from the truth! Throughout this chapter, we'll see how easy it is to test sites with nothing more than different browsers or online emulators. We'll take a look at some of the considerations and pitfalls we need to be mindful of and see how we can easily make improvements to those sites that aren't running as well as they should. We'll cover the following topics:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Considering the pitfalls of testing responsive media</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Testing responsive sites using emulators</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Using tools to determine speed</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Working through a theoretical example of slowness</li></ul></div><p>Ready? Let's get started!</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec41"/>A starting point for testing</h1></div></div></div><p>You've created that killer <a id="id217" class="indexterm"/>app or website and are ready to release it to the wild... or are you?</p><p>Before we release our creations into the wild, we need to test them thoroughly. It goes without saying that each and every element needs to be tested, but media such as images or videos need particular attention.</p><p>If the thought of testing conjures up images of needing lots of automated scripts, rigorous checking, and specialist software, think again. The most useful tool is the one we already have—our browser!</p><p>Granted, we need to perform lots of tests to ensure our content works well in a range of different devices. However, most of our testing can be done in desktop browsers, which come with responsive design facilities built within. They are not perfect, so we need the assistance of other facilities to <a id="id218" class="indexterm"/>complement our testing. Let's make a start though and take a look at the responsive facilities on offer in each browser, beginning with Chrome.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note24"/>Note</h3><p>It should be noted that commands given will be for Windows; for Mac users, we have <em>Cmd</em> + <em>Opt</em> in place of <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>Shift</em>.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec13"/>Using Google Chrome or Opera</h2></div></div></div><p>For testing <a id="id219" class="indexterm"/>responsive sites, Google Chrome is a hard act to beat. It offers the widest range of options to help with proving how well a responsive site works.</p><p>We can use it to <a id="id220" class="indexterm"/>change the user agent, alter the screen resolution, and even test <a id="id221" class="indexterm"/>retina-enabled devices; to enable the responsive design mode in <a id="id222" class="indexterm"/>Chrome is as simple as pressing <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>Shift</em> + <em>I</em>:</p><div><img src="img/6968OT_04_01.jpg" alt="Using Google Chrome or Opera"/></div><p>Opera's browser is almost identical. The responsive emulator can be enabled in the same manner, although <a id="id223" class="indexterm"/>some of the <a id="id224" class="indexterm"/>options are in slightly <a id="id225" class="indexterm"/>different locations.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec14"/>Using Firefox</h2></div></div></div><p>Not to be outdone, Firefox <a id="id226" class="indexterm"/>boasts a responsive design mode too; it is more simplistic than <a id="id227" class="indexterm"/>Chrome, but nonetheless serves a useful purpose. Firefox's <strong>Responsive Design View</strong> can be enabled by pressing <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>Shift</em> + <em>M</em>:</p><div><img src="img/6968OT_04_02.jpg" alt="Using Firefox"/></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip16"/>Tip</h3><p>Try clicking on the <strong>606 x 389 (custom)</strong> drop-down item and selecting a new value. Firefox will automatically resize the viewport to the new size; if the new screen size is larger, you <a id="id228" class="indexterm"/>will need to resize the browser window.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec15"/>Using Internet Explorer</h2></div></div></div><p>Internet Explorer <a id="id229" class="indexterm"/>takes a different approach to responsive design. To get the best emulation options requires the use of the latest version of the browser, which <a id="id230" class="indexterm"/>is version 11 at the time of this writing. The responsive emulation settings are held within the <strong>Developer</strong> toolbar (press <em>F12</em> to enable this), then switch to the <strong>Emulation</strong> tab to alter the settings:</p><div><img src="img/6968OT_04_03.jpg" alt="Using Internet Explorer"/></div><p>The key to testing using the desktop browser is twofold—they will give a reasonable approximation of what <a id="id231" class="indexterm"/>your site will look like in a mobile view and should act only as a starting point to your testing. The real tests will come when we start to use online testing services. These offer the opportunity to test over a number of devices at once, although there is no substitution for the real thing! We'll cover use of these services later in this chapter, in the <em>Testing responsive sites with online tools</em> section.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note25"/>Note</h3><p>
<strong>Some alternatives to consider</strong>
</p><p>While most testing is best completed online, there are a couple of options you may like to consider: Google Chrome has a more comprehensive browser add-in that emulates many online testing services. It's available at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.dimensionstoolkit.com/">http://www.dimensionstoolkit.com/</a>. Adobe has released Adobe Edge Inspect, which attempts to link your local development site to a mobile emulator. It's <a id="id232" class="indexterm"/>available through Apple iTunes—more details are available at <a class="ulink" href="http://html.adobe.com/edge/inspect/">http://html.adobe.com/edge/inspect/</a>.</p></div></div><p>So far we've seen that the only way to effectively test your site is manually, in as wide a range of browsers as <a id="id233" class="indexterm"/>possible, on different platforms. This is not without pitfalls. Let's <a id="id234" class="indexterm"/>take a moment to consider some of the traps that may trip us up, if we're not careful when testing our work.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec42"/>Considering pitfalls of responsive testing</h1></div></div></div><p>Who says <a id="id235" class="indexterm"/>testing is ever easy? This is true in most projects, but particularly so when testing responsive sites. We've concentrated on working with responsive media throughout this book, but many of the pitfalls we are likely to encounter will equally apply at a site level and not just to images or videos. The following list gives us an idea of such pitfalls:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Which devices should you test? To some degree, this will depend on researching your target market. But it should be a wide range to include both Android and iOS devices and popular mobile browsers such as Chrome, Opera Mini, and Dolphin.<p>We clearly can't test for every device, so use of Google Analytics is key to establishing a good range of devices that should be used. A great example of how testing has helped influence a company's responsive design is Marriot hotels. They found that their mobile site uncovered a number of issues with how their homepage was being displayed. Fixing these played an influential part in the design and construction of their responsive site offer.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note26"/>Note</h3><p>You can read the <a id="id236" class="indexterm"/>full article about the testing performed by Marriot at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.mobilemarketer.com/cms/news/software-technology/18494.html">http://www.mobilemarketer.com/cms/news/software-technology/18494.html</a>.</p></div></div></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What do your customers want to do on a mobile device? Is creating a seamless site that works for all devices and platforms the right thing to do or should you segment functionality based on what tasks your mobile users are asking for? Being selective about what is on offer on a mobile platform in relation to a full-sized site can act as a gauge of how useful a truly responsive site would be to your users.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A speed test is crucial. This will determine how well your site works on good or bad Wi-Fi connections, 4G, 3G, and EDGE; all of these should be tested (particularly EDGE, if you can find it!).</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Do you have access to colleagues, friends, or willing participants who can help test your site? Do they have the right devices that fit in with your test plans, so you can ensure you've covered enough devices?<div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note27"/>Note</h3><p>The reality is that anyone spending time developing responsive content will need to build up a pool of devices. If you work alone, then this may take some time; Brad Frost has put together some useful tips on how to test on real devices without it becoming too expensive. You can read his comments at <a class="ulink" href="http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/mobile/test-on-real-mobile-devices-without-breaking-the-bank/">http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/mobile/test-on-real-mobile-devices-without-breaking-the-bank/</a>.</p></div></div></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">There are plenty of emulators online to test responsive sites, but how well do they work? These will give you a feel for how well the site should work, but there is no substitute for testing on a real device!</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Screen resolution will play a major role. Resizing a site on a desktop with 1600 x 900 pixels will look different on a five-inch screen of a Galaxy S4, which will also be different to the 1334 x 750 pixel screen of a 4.7-inch retina display of an Apple iPhone 6. Not only will content appear much smaller, but images will differ when displayed on retina-enabled devices.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The use of <a id="id237" class="indexterm"/>media queries on your site will mean content may not be at the same location on the page, or even be displayed. This leads to an uneven playing field when testing, making automation impossible, and leading to increased costs of manual effort and resource.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Design strategies and approaches will differ between devices, making it difficult to test consistently across a range of devices. For instance, a hover interaction on a desktop will not transfer to a mobile device; links on one device can act differently on others. It requires the skill of an experienced tester to allow for these differences and to avoid applying tests incorrectly, which would result in inadequate coverage.</li></ul></div><p>The key point when testing is that nothing is ever consistent. Testing for one device or platform is not always likely to be the same for others! This is where the skill of an experienced tester will come into play. Ultimately, the level of testing performed on as wide a range of <a id="id238" class="indexterm"/>different devices will determine the success or failure of any responsive site.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec43"/>Testing responsive sites with online tools</h1></div></div></div><p>We've already <a id="id239" class="indexterm"/>seen that initial testing of our sites is possible in most desktop browsers, but there is a drawback to this approach. These tools will be set to display a limited set of screen sizes, which will require an update of the browser application to reflect any changes.</p><p>To help bolster <a id="id240" class="indexterm"/>our testing, we can use one of any number of online emulators. This has the advantage of dynamic resizing (by changing the size of the browser window), as well as choosing from any one of a number of preset sizes. While we may not be able to emulate the device perfectly, we can at least ensure that content will render correctly at a desired size.</p><p>Take, for <a id="id241" class="indexterm"/>example, Microsoft's site—when viewed using the ScreenFly emulator (available at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.quirktools.com/screenfly">http://www.quirktools.com/screenfly</a>)—set to display as a Motorola RAZR V8, it displays perfectly within the 240 x 320 pixel display that would be present on this device:</p><div><img src="img/6968OT_04_04.jpg" alt="Testing responsive sites with online tools"/></div><p>The site is clearly responsive—the images from the desktop version have been resized and repositioned and the menu system reworked to suit a mobile display. It's worth taking a look at some of the <a id="id242" class="indexterm"/>styles that are being set. Remember <a id="id243" class="indexterm"/>how we used the basic principle of using percentages, rather than fixed <code class="literal">em</code> or <code class="literal">rem</code> (or even <code class="literal">pixel</code>) values? The same principle is being applied here, where the main image immediately below the menu is resized to <code class="literal">166.5%</code> of its size.</p><p>We can prove this with a quick peek in a DOM inspector such as Firebug:</p><div><img src="img/6968OT_04_05.jpg" alt="Testing responsive sites with online tools"/></div><p>Notice the styles highlighted in the screenshot? This is a perfect example of what we talked about back in <a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Working with Responsive Images">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Working with Responsive Images</em>. Simply changing our image sizes to use percentages will go a long way to making a site responsive. Try resizing the browser <a id="id244" class="indexterm"/>window and notice how the values change in the DOM inspector.</p><p>In contrast, the Packt <a id="id245" class="indexterm"/>Publishing website (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.packtpub.com">www.packtpub.com</a>) is displayed in the same ScreenFly emulator:</p><div><img src="img/6968OT_04_06.jpg" alt="Testing responsive sites with online tools"/></div><p>ScreenFly, in this instance, is set to emulate a Kindle Fire at 800 x 600 pixels. The site clearly needs some work. The images are not responsive, with the result that the jumbotron at the top of the page is not fully displayed.</p><p>There are dozens of responsive emulators available for use. They all follow very similar principles, although they are likely to be more up to date, in terms of device sizes, than standard desktop browsers. The <a id="id246" class="indexterm"/>following are some alternatives to try:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Mat Kersley's simple responsive tester available at <a class="ulink" href="http://mattkersley.com/responsive/">http://mattkersley.com/responsive/</a></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Responsinator <a id="id247" class="indexterm"/>available at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.responsinator.com/">http://www.responsinator.com/</a></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Media <a id="id248" class="indexterm"/>Genesis' Responsive Design Checker available at <a class="ulink" href="http://responsivedesignchecker.com/">http://responsivedesignchecker.com/</a></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">OpenDeviceLab.com <a id="id249" class="indexterm"/>available at <a class="ulink" href="http://opendevicelab.com/">http://opendevicelab.com/</a></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Viewport <a id="id250" class="indexterm"/>Resizer by Malte Wasserman available at <a class="ulink" href="http://lab.maltewassermann.com/viewport-resizer/">http://lab.maltewassermann.com/viewport-resizer/</a></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">BrowserShots <a id="id251" class="indexterm"/>available at <a class="ulink" href="http://browsershots.org/">http://browsershots.org/</a></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">BrowserStack <a id="id252" class="indexterm"/>available at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.browserstack.com/">http://www.browserstack.com/</a></li></ul></div><p>A good site is Am I <a id="id253" class="indexterm"/>Responsive available at <a class="ulink" href="http://ami.responsivedesign.is">http://ami.responsivedesign.is</a>—this shows the site in a number of common devices at the same time:</p><div><img src="img/6968OT_04_07.jpg" alt="Testing responsive sites with online tools"/></div><p>Although the content appears very small, we can at least interact with the website to get a feel for how it works, and begin to see where there may be areas for improvement. Ultimately, it doesn't matter though how small or large your site is; if it crawls along at a snail's pace, then it will put visitors off. Fortunately, we can easily see if this is likely to become an issue for <a id="id254" class="indexterm"/>any site we operate as a precursor <a id="id255" class="indexterm"/>to tweaking elements to improve access.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec44"/>Using tools to determine speed</h1></div></div></div><p>There are <a id="id256" class="indexterm"/>plenty of ways to determine if our site is running slowly—arguably <a id="id257" class="indexterm"/>one of the most well known is YSlow by Yahoo available at <a class="ulink" href="https://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/">https://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/</a>. In the following screenshot, it is shown in use from within Firebug:</p><div><img src="img/6968OT_04_08.jpg" alt="Using tools to determine speed"/></div><p>YSlow is perfect to establish where there are slow elements in our pages. It uses a number of rules based on research by Yahoo's Exceptional Performance Team to work out how well a site measures up against its standards for performance.</p><p>Let's take a look at using it to see if some well-known sites could be improved. As an example, we'll begin <a id="id258" class="indexterm"/>with installing YSlow as a plugin for <a id="id259" class="indexterm"/>Firefox.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note28"/>Note</h3><p>This example assumes <a id="id260" class="indexterm"/>we are using Firefox with Firebug already installed; if it is not already present, then you can download and install it from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.getfirebug.com">http://www.getfirebug.com</a>.</p></div></div><p>There are various ways to install YSlow. They include using a bookmarklet, browser add-ins, or working directly from the command line. The most convenient is a browser plugin, so we can assess a site directly:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Let's start by browsing to <a class="ulink" href="https://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/">https://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/</a> and clicking on <strong>Firefox</strong> under <strong>Availability</strong> to install the Firefox add-on.</li><li class="listitem">At this point, follow the instructions—the add-on installs using the normal process for Firefox plugins.</li></ol></div><p>At this point, we are ready to start using YSlow:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Browse to <a class="ulink" href="http://www.microsoft.com">http://www.microsoft.com</a> and resize the window to a smaller size; the aim is to emulate the appearance of working on a smaller device.</li><li class="listitem">Click on the Firebug icon or go to <strong>View</strong> | <strong>Firebug</strong>, then switch to the <strong>YSlow</strong> tab.</li><li class="listitem">Click on the <strong>Run Test</strong> button to fire off the main test. This runs through a number of tests <a id="id261" class="indexterm"/>before producing a list of its <a id="id262" class="indexterm"/>findings:<div><img src="img/6968OT_04_09.jpg" alt="Using tools to determine speed"/></div></li><li class="listitem">We're interested in the tests that relate to images, so click on <strong>IMAGES (2)</strong> to filter the results.</li></ol></div><p>Now that we've seen the results of the scan, let's analyze some of the results.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec16"/>Analyzing results</h2></div></div></div><p>Take, for <a id="id263" class="indexterm"/>example, the following entry:</p><p>
<a class="ulink" href="http://c.s-microsoft.com/en-gb/CMSImages/SpringPromo_LastFrameBG_1600x540_EN_US.jpg?version=250bf4d8-ad95-96e7-3b61-394b95449a92">http://c.s-microsoft.com/en-gb/CMSImages/SpringPromo_LastFrameBG_1600x540_EN_US.jpg?version=250bf4d8-ad95-96e7-3b61-394b95449a92</a>
</p><p>This happens to be the first on the list; it is the main one displayed immediately below the menu bar:</p><div><img src="img/6968OT_04_10.jpg" alt="Analyzing results"/></div><p>This is a perfect example of how it has failed the test for YSlow. The original image has been scaled, which puts <a id="id264" class="indexterm"/>extra demand on the server when rendering it on screen down to 1366 x 461 px:</p><div><img src="img/6968OT_04_11.jpg" alt="Analyzing results"/></div><p>This seems perfectly reasonable. Scaling down an image will put extra demand on the server.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec17"/>Digging further into the code</h2></div></div></div><p>Hold on! Something <a id="id265" class="indexterm"/>doesn't add up here. If we dig further by using Firebug to check the CSS styles, we can see the styles applied in the following screenshot. In this instance, it's an example of <code class="literal">.hero .image .media</code> and <code class="literal">.hero .img video</code>:</p><div><img src="img/6968OT_04_12.jpg" alt="Digging further into the code"/></div><p>Now, did anyone spot anything? The keen-eyed among you should have spotted that this image has already appeared earlier in the <em>Testing responsive sites with online tools</em> section. There, we noted <a id="id266" class="indexterm"/>that the site appeared to be responsive—dynamic percentage values have been used, instead of fixed values; this we would expect to see on responsive sites. So, what gives? Why, with percentage values, are we still seeing issues being reported by YSlow?</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec18"/>Revealing all</h2></div></div></div><p>Well, to find out why, we <a id="id267" class="indexterm"/>need to dig further into the CSS file being used on <a class="ulink" href="http://www.microsoft.com">http://www.microsoft.com</a>. In the screenshot from Firebug, did you notice the <code class="literal">166.5%</code> value against <code class="literal">max-width</code>? And that this is overriding a <code class="literal">max-width</code> value of <code class="literal">100%</code> immediately below? Therein lies our first clue—back in <a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Working with Responsive Images">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Working with Responsive Images</em>, I mentioned that the basic and easiest way to create responsive images is to set a <code class="literal">max-width</code> value of <code class="literal">100%</code>.</p><p>It's not without its own quirks, but will satisfy most requirements—at least as a starting point to implementing responsive behavior. So why do we have a value that is over 50 percent higher?</p><p>The true answer to this lies in the CSS file. A search of it using a text editor, such as Sublime Text, would appear to show that media queries have been used. This we would expect to see. But where the design has fallen over is in how the images have been set to display on the page.</p><p>The image we've selected is only set once. None of the media queries have been set to replace the image with a <a id="id268" class="indexterm"/>smaller one if the viewport or browser window size is reduced—therein lies the problem!</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec19"/>Fixing the problem</h2></div></div></div><p>While we clearly do not <a id="id269" class="indexterm"/>have access to alter the code, we can at least work out the steps required to fix the problem:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">In Firefox, right-click on the image and click on <strong>View Image Info</strong> to view the properties.<div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note29"/>Note</h3><p>In this exercise, I will assume you are using GIMP for Windows. If you are using a different package, please adjust the steps accordingly.</p></div></div><p>This screenshot shows the page resized to the smallest width possible in Firefox:</p><div><img src="img/6968OT_04_13.jpg" alt="Fixing the problem"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Click on <strong>Save As…</strong> to save a copy locally—the name is not critical; open it in an image editing application, such as PhotoShop or GIMP.</li><li class="listitem">When opened, it will show at full size, which is <strong>1600px x 540px</strong>; navigate to <strong>Image</strong> | <strong>Scale Image...</strong> and set the new size to <strong>475px x 160px</strong>. Click on <strong>Scale</strong> to resize the image.</li><li class="listitem">Next, go to <strong>File</strong> | <strong>Overwrite…</strong> to update the image. On <strong>Export Image as JPEG</strong>, push the Quality scale to <strong>100%</strong> if it is not already set at this value.</li><li class="listitem">Click on <strong>Export</strong> to complete the process—the image will now be saved to the new dimensions.</li></ol></div><p>At this point, we have an updated image, which would normally be uploaded to the website. A quick check shows that it has been reduced from a hefty 96 KB down to a more reasonable 38 KB. This makes it quicker to download in our style sheet.</p><p>Of course, to really finish <a id="id270" class="indexterm"/>it off though, we would need to include a media query in our style sheet that makes use of the smaller image when the viewport has been suitably resized, such as the following lines of code:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">@media screen and (max-width: 475px) {
....
  .hero.media img {
    background: url(&lt;path and name of new file&gt;) no repeat;
  ...
  }
}</pre></div><p>Not only does this mean that we're reducing the amount of content to download, but we're also removing some of the demand on the server and helping to make the response time of the site snappier—a win-win for all concerned! It takes a little research and planning to achieve this. But once implemented, it will dramatically reduce the overall effort required to make our media content responsive.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec45"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>Website testing is one of the key steps to creating online sites. This is our chance to ensure that images and videos resize properly and that content appears correctly in our responsive sites. Throughout this chapter, we've taken a look at how we should test responsive content. Let's take a moment to consider what we have learned.</p><p>We kicked off with a look at the simplest form of testing, using the usual desktop browsers. We saw how this will take care of the basics, but that we can complement it using online services that can emulate multiple browsers at the same time.</p><p>Next up came a look at some of the pitfalls of responsive site testing; we learned how the most effective way to test is doing it manually. There are too many inconsistencies that make any form of automation difficult.</p><p>Moving swiftly on, we then turned our attention to using online tools to test responsive content—we saw how they work in a similar fashion to the responsive features in desktop browsers, but can offer a wider range of facilities. We then rounded out the chapter with a look at testing of responsive sites. We saw how with YSlow, we can soon identify slow responding elements; we then worked through a theoretical example to see what would happen and how we could fix it if we were the owner of the site.</p><p>Phew! It may have only been a short chapter, but we covered a lot! In the next one, we'll be taking a look at applying some of the principles that we've covered throughout the book to CMS systems such as WordPress.</p></div></body></html>
