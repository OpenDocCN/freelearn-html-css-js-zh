<p>The world of 3D application and game development is a vast and actively changing landscape. With all the stunning capabilities of modern GPU hardware exposed to the web browser via WebGL, AAA-quality interactive rendering can be achieved by anyone with some knowledge of JavaScript. Babylon.js is just the right tool to use for an effortless experience and a robust application built using WebGL technologies. </p>
<p>Although changes in and the evolution of browser software and hardware standards continue at their own pace and on their own schedules, Babylon.js is a framework that prioritizes maintaining backward compatibility. Code written for BJS 2.0 is highly likely to run with little to no modifications in BJS 5.20, so product managers and stakeholders can use BJS with confidence about the long-term stability of the code. </p>
<p>If Babylon.js is the ticket for WebGL, then this book is your ticket to mastering Babylon.js. Well, you probably won’t become a twentieth-level Babylon.js developer by the end of this (let’s be real for a moment), but you’ll certainly learn the key concepts and techniques that will enable you to progress down that path should you so choose!</p>
<p>All of this is starting to become a kind of bad sales pitch, so let’s drop the pretense and talk brass tacks. You want or need to learn about 3D game or app development. As a human being, you also desire entertainment. This book attempts to satisfy both of those needs by avoiding being too boring wherever possible while still delivering the big knowledge bombs. Entertainment and enlightenment, all in one package.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-10"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>This book is for artists who avoid coding because they think they’re bad at math (give yourself more credit!), game designers whose fingers long to leave the spreadsheet, and developers dreaming of worlds yet to be made. This book is for students who want to learn outside of their classrooms, teachers who want their students to learn inside their classrooms, and parents who want their teenage kids to learn something, anything at all. </p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-12"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
<p>You’ll want to be at least passingly familiar with JavaScript before engaging with the activities in this book, at least to the point where you are not fazed by looking at code that may initially be unfamiliar. Knowing basic 3D concepts and terms is also helpful. If you are new to Babylon.js, JavaScript, or 3D development, then a fantastic place to start is the Babylon.js start page at <a href="https://doc.babylonjs.com/journey/theFirstStep">https://doc.babylonjs.com/journey/theFirstStep</a>. </p>

<p>A web browser with the Mozilla or Chrome rendering engine is recommended, as it has the greatest level of support for various WebGL and WebGPU features. Safari (WebKit) is known to be significantly behind the other engines listed in its support with similar functionality.</p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-15"><a id="_idTextAnchor014"/>Conventions used</h1>
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><code>Code in text</code>: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. Here is an example: “The <code>createSpinAnimation</code> method is called from <code>createStartScene</code> to make the <code>spinAnim</code> variable available to the rest of the scene’s controlling code.”</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre class="source-code">&#13;
planets.forEach(p =&gt; {&#13;
    p.animations.push(spinAnim);&#13;
      scene.beginAnimation(p, 0, 60, true, BABYLON.Scalar.RandomRange(0.1, 3));&#13;
});</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre class="source-code">&#13;
planets.forEach(p =&gt; {&#13;
        <strong class="bold">glowLayer.addExcludedMesh(p);</strong>&#13;
        p.animations.push(spinAnim);&#13;
        scene.beginAnimation(p, 0, 60, true, BABYLON.Scalar.RandomRange(0.1, 3));&#13;
    });</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre>npx webpack –config webpack.common.js</pre>
<p><strong class="bold">Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see onscreen. For instance, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in <strong class="bold">bold</strong>. Here is an example: “Clicking <strong class="bold">Run</strong> should now show a nifty-looking starfield in a skybox you can pan around.”</p>

<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/>Part 1: Building the Application</h1>
<p>This first part of the book establishes the important foundations that will be leveraged in future chapters. Starting with a survey of Space-Truckers and Babylon.js, we will construct the main pillars of the game’s hosting application. Although a basic understanding of Babylon.js is recommended, the main requirement is to have some knowledge of JavaScript or a similar programming language.</p>
