    more efficient and effective in executing test automation projects from conception
    to completion. Ensure that the knowledge gained during the test automation life
    cycle should be captured in a way that it becomes effective for future references.

    minds; it is always in the best interests of the individual, project, and the
    organization. It is important to bring these lessons into writing by documenting
    them.

    capturing and documenting the lessons learned is not enough. You need to ensure
    that these lessons are saved and available for reuse; they should be easily accessible

    access to the documents with other teams across the organization. Some organizations
    have a **Software Process Engineering Group** (**SPEG**). Some team members of
    the SPEG group review the documents and libraries before the artifacts are submitted
