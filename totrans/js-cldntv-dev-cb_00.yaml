- en: Welcome to the *JavaScript Cloud Native Development Cookbook*. This cookbook
    is packed full of recipes to help you along your cloud-native journey. It is intended
    to be a companion to another of my books, *Cloud Native Development Patterns and
    Best Practices*. I have personally found delivering cloud-native solutions to
    be, by far, the most fun and satisfying development practice. This is because
    cloud-native is more than just optimizing for the cloud. It is an entirely different
    way of thinking and reasoning about software systems.

- en: In a nutshell, cloud-native is lean and autonomous. Powered by disposable infrastructure,
    leveraging fully managed cloud services and embracing disposable architecture,
    cloud-native empowers everyday, self-sufficient, full-stack teams to rapidly and
    continuously experiment with innovations, while simultaneously building global-scale
    systems with much less effort than ever before. Following this serverless-first
    approach allows teams to move fast, but this rapid pace also opens the opportunity
    for honest human error to wreak havoc across the system. To guard against this,
    cloud-native systems are composed of autonomous services, which creates bulkheads
    between the services to reduce the blast radius during a disruption.

- en: In this cookbook, you will learn how to build autonomous services by eliminating
    all synchronous inter-service communication. You will turn the database inside
    out and ultimately turn the cloud into the database by implementing the event
    sourcing and CQRS patterns with event streaming and materialized views. Your team
    will build confidence in its ability to deliver because asynchronous inter-service
    communication and data replication remove the downstream and upstream dependencies
    that make systems brittle. You will also learn how to continuously deploy, test,
    observe, optimize, and secure your autonomous services across multiple regions.

- en: To get the most out of this book, be prepared with an open mind to discover
    why cloud-native is different. Cloud-native forces us to rewire how we reason
    about systems. It tests all our preconceived notions of software architecture.
    So, be prepared to have a lot of fun building cloud-native systems.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is intended to help create self-sufficient, full-stack, cloud-native
    development teams. Some cloud experience is helpful, but not required. Basic knowledge
    of the JavaScript language is assumed. The book serves as a reference for experienced
    cloud-native developers and as a quick start for entry-level cloud-native developers.
    Most of all, this book is for anyone who is ready to rewire their engineering
    brain for cloud-native development.
