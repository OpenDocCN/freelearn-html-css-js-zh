- en: We live in the century of information and a lot of this information is susceptible
    to being represented geographically. This is probably the main feature that has
    made Geographic Information System (GIS) become one of the most important aspects
    of many companies. GIS-related technologies are a growing industry and, because
    of this, GIS has become a desired skill for many professionals.

    has made it possible for the Web to become a main part of the current GIS and
    has subtracted the importance of desktop applications because of its capabilities:
    the browsers allow us to show data visualizations to the masses, create online
    data editors, and so on.'

    library to create any kind of web mapping application. In addition to offering
    a great set of components, such as maps, layers, or controls, OpenLayers offers
    access to a great number of data sources using many different data formats, implements
    many standards from *Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC,* [http://www.opengeospatial.org](http://www.opengeospatial.org)),
    and is compatible with almost all browsers.

    a map, how to manage the layers stack, how to work with controls, and how to add
    OpenLayers within your project.'

    is centered on working and understanding the main raster layers. OpenLayers offers
    the opportunity to work with main service providers, such as Google or Bing, plus
    integrating with open source ones, such as OpenStreetMap, or working with WMS
    servers.'

    markers, and popups.'

    to the map, a layer is loaded, a feature is added, and so on.'

    creating a complete new theme.'

    HTML pages, implies that the user must be familiarized with these technologies.
  id: totrans-14

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To run the recipes you need to place the code bundle within a HTTP server that
    serves the pages. All library dependencies required by the recipes code, such
    as OpenLayers or Dojo toolkit ([http://dojotoolkit.org](http://dojotoolkit.org)),
    are included in the bundle itself.
  id: totrans-15
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some recipes request data from PHP scripts included in the source bundle. The
    function of these scripts is to generate some random data to later integrate within
    the map. To run these recipes properly the reader needs a HTTP server with PHP
    support.

- en: For better user experience, we have created a main application that allows the
    desired recipe to run and show its source code. Supposing the reader has installed
    and configured a local web server, and the bundle code is copied within the HTTP
    server root content folder in the `openlayers-cookbook` folder, the user can run
    the main application by accessing the [http://localhost/openlayers-cookbook/index.html](http://localhost/openlayers-cookbook/index.html)
    URL in the browser.

- en: We have made use of the Dojo toolkit in many of the recipes because it allows
    us to create rich components such as sliders or toggle buttons. Dojo's JavaScript
    library and CSS files are included in the `index.html` file, so the HTML recipe
    files do not have to include them. If the reader plans to run the recipes as standalone
    web pages, he/she will need to include Dojo's JavaScript library and CSS files
    in the recipe file, otherwise the recipe will not work properly.
