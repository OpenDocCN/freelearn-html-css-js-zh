In this chapter, we will be focusing on customizing an Ionic application. The Ionic SDK comes by default with some great tools that make it easy to customize your application to fit the design guides of your brand. This is thanks to its built-in integration of Gulp for your build process needs and SCSS for CSS preprocessing.</p><p class="calibre10">Ionic also has a special Angular provider <a id="id233" class="calibre1"/>called <code class="email">$ionicConfigProvider</code>. This provider can be used to do a lot of configuration and customization like specifying what type of animations your application should use or even more advanced stuff like specifying how many cache items you want in your cache. The <code class="email">$ionicConfigProvider</code> also lets you specify these configurations on a global level, or on a platform-by-platform basis.</p></div>

Many times you will want to know how you can add your own colors and styles while keeping some of the built-in Ionic styles.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_2"><a id="ch07lvl2sec29" class="calibre1"/>Ionic styles with SASS</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre10">This is well thought<a id="id235" class="calibre1"/> out by the Ionic team and for this reason, they actually created all their CSS styles using SCSS. SCSS is an independent technology based on SASS that lets you write CSS in an object-oriented way which then gets compiled into CSS. SCSS is a really cool way to write CSS rules as it allows us to create variables and use them to create our style sheet. If you are completely new to SCSS and you want to see<a id="id236" class="calibre1"/> some brief information about SCSS, feel free to visit <a class="calibre1" href="http://sass-lang.com">http://sass-lang.com</a>.</p><p class="calibre10">Now, let's have a look at the folder structure of an Ionic project once more with customization of our styles with SCSS in mind.</p></div></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch07lvl1sec25" class="calibre1"/>Ionic SCSS overview</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre10">To have an overview<a id="id237" class="calibre1"/> of the SCSS structure of Ionic, we are going to create a brand new application using the Ionic blank template. We are going to call this application <code class="email">custom-app</code>. The following is the command to create this new application. Fire up a terminal window on your computer and CD into a directory of your choice and run the following command:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong class="calibre11">ionic start custom-app blank</strong>
</pre></div><p class="calibre10">After you have created your new <code class="email">custom-app</code> application, open this new project in your favorite IDE to have an overview of the folder structure. You should see something close to what we have in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/00050.jpeg" alt="Ionic SCSS overview" class="calibre12"/></div><p class="calibre13"> </p><p class="calibre10">There are two<a id="id238" class="calibre1"/> folders that you should pay close attention to. The first folder is the <code class="email">scss</code> folder found in the root directory of the project. This folder has a file called <code class="email">ionic.app.scss</code> within it; we will take a look at this in more detail. The following is a screenshot of what this folder looks like:</p><div><img src="img/00051.jpeg" alt="Ionic SCSS overview" class="calibre12"/></div><p class="calibre13"> </p><p class="calibre10">The second folder is also titled <code class="email">scss</code>, but this folder can be found by navigating to the following path from the root folder <code class="email">www/lib/ionic/scss</code>.</p><p class="calibre10">The following screenshot shows this folder:</p><div><img src="img/00052.jpeg" alt="Ionic SCSS overview" class="calibre12"/></div><p class="calibre13"> </p><p class="calibre10">Now, if you<a id="id239" class="calibre1"/> look even further within this second <code class="email">scss</code> folder, you should see something that closely resembles what we have in the following screenshot with a number of SCSS files within the <code class="email">scss</code> folder:</p><div><img src="img/00053.jpeg" alt="Ionic SCSS overview" class="calibre12"/></div><p class="calibre13"> </p><p class="calibre10">This <code class="email">scss</code> folder contains a numerous amount of files and you might be wondering what these files are for. As a part of this book, you do not need to understand the entire process of what these files are doing, but you need to know that they are the files that contain the SCSS code for <a id="id240" class="calibre1"/>every Ionic element. The entire Ionic CSS style sheet is generated by compiling these SCSS files. It is possible to go into these files to make changes to any SCSS file, but this is probably not a good idea, as you will risk breaking any dependencies in the SCSS code. For this reason, Ionic provides a much simpler way to do this thanks to <code class="email">ionic.app.scss</code> that we briefly looked at earlier and will be looking at closely now.</p></div>

To customize the look and feel of Ionic, you can override the variables in ionic's _variables.scss file.

For example, you might change some of the default colors:

Now, before we start learning how to actually override these files, first let's learn<a id="id244" class="calibre1"/> how to set up our SCSS for our project.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_2"><a id="ch07lvl2sec31" class="calibre1"/>Setting up SCSS</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre10">Before we set up the SCSS, we will first have a brief look at how our CSS is currently integrated. When <a id="id245" class="calibre1"/>you create a new Ionic project, the project uses styles from two sources by default.</p><p class="calibre10">The first source is the <code class="email">ionic.css</code> file which can be found in the path <code class="email">lib/ionic/css/ionic.css</code>. This file contains already compiled CSS code for all the Ionic default styles. It is simply a CSS compilation of all the SCSS files found in the <code class="email">www/lib/ionic/scss/ionic</code> directory relative to the root directory of your project.</p><p class="calibre10">The second source is the <code class="email">style.css</code> file found in the <code class="email">css/style.css</code> path relative to the root directory of your project. This file is normally empty at the time you create your project and is a place where you can enter your own custom styles in CSS, if you do not want to use SCSS. A look at the <code class="email">index.html</code> file as shown in the following screenshot shows how these two files are referenced as CSS style sheets by default:</p><div><img src="img/00055.jpeg" alt="Setting up SCSS" class="calibre12"/></div><p class="calibre13"> </p><p class="calibre10">With this explained, we will go ahead and start setting up SCSS on our Ionic application.</p><p class="calibre10">Setting up SCSS can be quite challenging traditionally but Ionic comes built-in with some tools that make it easy. To begin the process of setting up the SCSS of your project, fire up a terminal <a id="id246" class="calibre1"/>window and simply navigate into your project's root directory by running the <code class="email">cd custom-app</code> command.</p><p class="calibre10">The next step is to install <code class="email">bower</code> on your computer if you do not already have this installed. You can do so by running the following command:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong class="calibre11">npm install bower –g</strong>
</pre></div><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="note08" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre10">You might need to prefix the <code class="email">sudo</code> command if you are on a Linux or Mac computer. This will be <code class="email">sudo npm install bower –g</code>.</p></div><p class="calibre10">After this, the final step to get SCSS setup is by running the following command:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong class="calibre11">ionic setup sass</strong>
</pre></div><p class="calibre10">This command will do all the necessary things behind the scenes that are needed to enable your project to work with SCSS. After this command is complete, you will notice a new folder called the <code class="email">node-modules</code> folder in the root of your project. This is completely normal and is the folder that contains the packages necessary for your project to work with SCSS.</p><p class="calibre10">By now, we have successfully set up SCSS for our project. The first thing you should look at is your <code class="email">index.html</code> file. Your <code class="email">index.html</code> should resemble the following code block:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1, maximum- scale=1, user-scalable=no, width=device-width"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;


    &lt;!-- compiled css output --&gt;
    &lt;link href="css/ionic.app.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;

    &lt;!-- ionic/angularjs js --&gt;
    &lt;script src="img/ionic.bundle.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

    &lt;!-- cordova script (this will be a 404 during development) --&gt;
    &lt;script src="img/cordova.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

    &lt;!-- your app's js --&gt;
    &lt;script src="img/app.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body ng-app="starter"&gt;

    &lt;ion-pane&gt;
      &lt;ion-header-bar class="bar-stable"&gt;
        &lt;h1 class="title"&gt;Ionic Blank Starter&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;/ion-header-bar&gt;
      &lt;ion-content&gt;
      &lt;/ion-content&gt;
    &lt;/ion-pane&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre></div><p class="calibre10">The first thing you will notice in the header is that the reference to CSS files have changed in comparison<a id="id247" class="calibre1"/> to what we briefly discussed earlier. Now, you have only one CSS reference in the <code class="email">&lt;head&gt;</code> part of <code class="email">index.html</code> pointing to <code class="email">css/ionic.app.css</code>. You might be wondering how this happened. Well, basically when you set up SCSS like we have done in this chapter so far, Ionic automatically sets up the SCSS to compile all the SCSS and output them into <code class="email">ionic.app.css</code>.</p><div><img src="img/00056.jpeg" alt="Setting up SCSS" class="calibre12"/></div><p class="calibre13"> </p><p class="calibre10">If you navigate to the <code class="email">www/css</code> path, you will see that we have three files as opposed to one as we saw earlier. You will see an <code class="email">ionic.app.css</code> file and an <code class="email">ionic.app.min.css</code> file. These two files are the same with <code class="email">ionic.app.min.css</code> being a minified version of the <code class="email">ionic.app.css</code>. They are the output of all the SCSS files that we checked out earlier compiled into one file. There are a lot more things that happen behind the scenes to ensure that this SCSS compilation happens, but for the sake of simplicity we won't be going deep into that in<a id="id248" class="calibre1"/> this book.</p></div></div>

<strong class="calibre11">ionic serve</strong>
</pre></div><p class="calibre10">This should bring up your application running in the browser and you should see something that closely resembles what we have in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/00057.jpeg" alt="Customizing the SCSS" class="calibre12"/></div><p class="calibre13"> </p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="note09" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre10">Make sure you don't close your terminal or terminate the serve session from here on, in order to follow the instructions that come soon.</p></div><p class="calibre10">Now to explain what we will try to do, first let's have a look at the code for the head of this app. The code <a id="id250" class="calibre1"/>block is the code for our app and you can find this in the <code class="email">index.html</code> file in the <code class="email">www</code> folder of your project:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;

        &lt;h1 class="title"&gt;Ionic Blank Starter&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;/ion-header-bar&gt;
      &lt;ion-content&gt;
      &lt;/ion-content&gt;
    &lt;/ion-pane&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre></div><p class="calibre10">Pay close attention to the piece of code that represents the main view part of the preceding code block which is also represented in the following code block:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">    &lt;ion-pane&gt;
      &lt;ion-header-bar class="bar-stable"&gt;
        &lt;h1 class="title"&gt;Ionic Blank Starter&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;/ion-header-bar&gt;
      &lt;ion-content&gt;
      &lt;/ion-content&gt;
    &lt;/ion-pane&gt;</pre></div><p class="calibre10">If you look at the opening <code class="email">&lt;ion-header&gt;</code> tag, you will see that it has a class called <code class="email">bar-stable</code>. This is an in-built class that Ionic comes with which gives the header a sort of light gray color, as seen from the screenshot we visited earlier.</p><p class="calibre10">Let's say we want to customize this header to fit our brand color and let's say, for example, that our brand color and this brand happens to be my favorite accent of red which has the hex code of <code class="email">#D71300</code>.</p><p class="calibre10">Now, you might be tempted to go into the <code class="email">ionic.app.css</code> file to look for every occurrence of this<a id="id251" class="calibre1"/> in our CSS style sheet and change it. But remember that this <code class="email">ionic.app.css</code> is generated based on our SCSS files. Ionic gives us a great way to override default styles with SCSS thanks to the <code class="email">ionic.app.scss</code> file which can be found in the <code class="email">scss</code> directory. We looked at this file earlier and we are going to look at it again:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">/*
