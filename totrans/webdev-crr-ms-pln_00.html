<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
<p>The field of web development is an exciting one, where rapid technological changes are the order of the day. This can make it a challenging field when it comes to knowing where to start. When I broke into this field, all we really needed was a basic text editor such as Notepad, and some time to look at the code behind websites to glean the basics of what was involved in building them. Being self-taught was still difficult back then, but it was certainly easier as there wasn’t nearly as much to learn.</p>
<p>Things are far from that simple now though! Figuring out where to begin your journey is tricky. And then, when you <em class="italic">do</em> figure that out and learn the basics of the technology, you have to confront the challenge of entering the field in a professional capacity, which can be difficult when you don’t have a lot to demonstrate your capabilities.</p>
<p>And then once you figure out how to crack <em class="italic">that</em> nut, the challenge shifts to keeping up with the constant churn of technology, continuing to expand your capabilities, and learning how to fit in and do good work.</p>
<p>So yes, while it’s an exciting field, it’s also a challenging one. But I hope that I, through this book, will be able to draw on nearly 30 years of professional experience to help you start the journey on solid footing, building up a good foundation in technology, plus a lot of other skills you’ll need to be a successful web developer.</p>

<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
&lt;h1&gt;Luke Skywalker&lt;/h1&gt;

</div>
<div><p>In this part, you will begin to learn the basics of what it means to be a web developer. We’ll talk about what a web developer is and what a typical workday for one might look like, plus the job titles and types of work that define it.</p>
<p>We’ll also start exploring the technology involved, including the “big three” of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You’ll gain an understanding of the client/server divide, what the frontend and backend are, and how they work together. You’ll gain some knowledge on networking and the types of websites and applications a web developer could be asked to build.</p>
<p>Finally, you’ll get your first experience building an actual website to see how all the pieces fit together to form a final product.</p>
<p>This part includes the following chapters:</p>
