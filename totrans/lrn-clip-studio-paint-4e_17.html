<h1 class="chapterTitle" id="_idParaDest-300">Auto Actions and Your Workflow</h1>
<p class="normal">Auto actions are an amazing feature of digital art. They can simplify your workflow and save you time and effort when creating your drawings. What are auto actions? Auto actions are sets of recorded steps that can be played back, automating a task or tasks and completing them with the press of a button.</p>
<p class="normal">What sorts of tasks can be made into an auto action? <strong class="keyWord">Scenario 1</strong>: we have a blank manga page, and to start creating art on it, we need a panel layer folder (we can divide the panel later), a sketch layer named <em class="italic">Sketch</em>, an ink layer named <em class="italic">Ink</em> or <em class="italic">Line art</em>, background layers named <em class="italic">Background 1</em> and <em class="italic">Background 2</em>, grayscale layers to add shading named <em class="italic">Gray 1</em> and <em class="italic">Gray 2</em>, a highlight layer named <em class="italic">Highlight</em>, and a sound effect layer named <em class="italic">SE</em>. Auto action can do all of this in one click. <strong class="keyWord">Scenario 2</strong>: we have a blank canvas on which we want to create a color character drawing. We need a sketch layer named <em class="italic">Sketch</em>, an ink layer named <em class="italic">Ink</em>, a skin color layer named <em class="italic">Skin</em>, a skin details layer named <em class="italic">Skin 2 </em>that has got a clipping mask to the skin layer below, and more… Again, auto action can do all of this in one click. Not only this, though; it can do just about anything that you can dream up!</p>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>

<li class="bulletList">Using auto actions</li>
<li class="bulletList">Creating a custom auto action</li>
<li class="bulletList">Downloading auto action assets</li>
<li class="bulletList">Auto action shortcuts</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">We are going to look at what auto actions are and how to apply them to your workflow. We will learn how to create a new auto action set, download auto action assets, and then finally, create auto action shortcuts in two different ways.</p>
<p class="normal">By the end of this chapter, you will be able to save a lot of time by creating and using auto actions to accelerate the speed of a frequently applied set of actions. Let Clip Studio Paint do repetitive actions automatically! It will surely make the creation of a long series of manga or comics less tiring.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s get started!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-301">Technical requirements</h1>
<p class="normal">To get started, you need Clip Studio Paint installed on your device, and a new canvas opened with any line art layer and a white paper layer. Any size is fine, but I recommend creating a 300 dpi square canvas to go through the content in this chapter.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-302">Exploring the Auto Action palette</h1>
<p class="normal">Let’s start by <a id="_idIndexMarker1310"/>looking at the <strong class="screenText">Auto Action</strong> palette and what it contains.</p>
<p class="normal">Do you have a specific process when you create digital drawings, such as always adding a clipping mask for a clothing color layer of your character or always duplicating a line drawing layer, then adding a blur effect to it? Wouldn’t it be a brilliant time saver if you could let Clip Studio Paint do these actions automatically? Your dreams have come true. In this section, you will learn the first step of how to use auto actions: finding the <strong class="screenText">Auto Action</strong> palette and then opening it.</p>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Auto Action</strong> palette (<em class="italic">Figure 17.1</em>) can be found by clicking on the <strong class="screenText">Window</strong> heading in the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu and then clicking on <strong class="screenText">Auto Action</strong>. If this menu item is already checked, then the palette is already in the interface somewhere. By default, it is a<a id="_idIndexMarker1311"/> tab in the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_17_17.1.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.1: Auto Action palette (1)</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s break down the parts of this palette. The drop-down menu at the top of the palette allows us to switch between different sets of auto actions. The set of actions in the preceding screenshot is the <strong class="screenText">Default</strong> set and comes included in Clip Studio Paint.</p>
<p class="normal">The icons to the right of the drop-down menu are <strong class="screenText">Create New Auto Action Set</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Add Auto Action Set</strong>. The trashcan icon at the bottom right is the delete button to erase a currently selected step of auto actions. Next to the delete action icon is the <strong class="screenText">Add New Auto Action Set</strong> button, then to the left of that is the <strong class="screenText">Play Action</strong> icon, which plays the selected action when you click on it; finally, the far-left round icon is <strong class="screenText">Record Auto Action</strong>.</p>
<p class="normal">For your interest, let’s<a id="_idIndexMarker1312"/> have a look at this <strong class="screenText">Default</strong> auto action set:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Create draft layer</strong>: This creates a new raster layer, names it, and sets it as a draft layer. Basically, it creates a foundation for sketching, shown in <em class="italic">Figure 17.2.</em></li>
</ul>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_17_17.2.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.2: Create draft layer result</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Create toning layer of halftone dots</strong>: This creates a 60.0 LPI dot tone layer. You can find out more about screentones in the <em class="italic">Adding screentones</em> section of <em class="italic">Chapter 12, Making Layer Masks and Screentones</em>. You can start adding shade to your black and white manga by creating a new layer and searching for the right screentone.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_17_17.3.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.3: Create toning layer result</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Making a clipping folder</strong>: This creates two clipping layers above the selected layer, creates<a id="_idIndexMarker1313"/> a folder, and puts the three layers in it. It’s a process that gets you ready to add extra colors without flooding a boundary. You can add shade and shine effects safely within the flat color area you have already created. The result will look like <em class="italic">Figure 17.4.</em></li>
</ul>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_17_17.4.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.4: Making a clipping folder result</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Cut and move a selected subject to another layer</strong>: This copies and cuts out the content of the selected area, creates a new layer above the active layer, and pastes the content on the new layer. This is useful when you want to move certain content to a new layer quickly. For instance, you might have several items in one layer but just need to deal with only one item, such as a bunch of hair.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Draw by rounding the corners of selection</strong>: This creates a shape with rounded corners of whatever the original shape of the selection area on an active layer was, with a border line of foreground color and filled with the background color. It’s a good auto action for whenever you<a id="_idIndexMarker1314"/> need a rounded corner manga panel! The result will look as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 17.5.</em></li>
</ul>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_17_17.5.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.5: Draw by rounding the corners result</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Expand the selection by 1 px and fill</strong>: This makes the selected colored area expand by 1 px. It’s a great solution when you have unnecessary gaps between a color and line drawings.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Expand the selection by 5 px and fill</strong>: This does the same thing as the preceding auto action, but it expands the colored area to 5 px wider than the selected area.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Bright colors emit light (glow)</strong>: This adds a dramatic glow effect to the lighting of your drawing. It duplicates the active layer, adds extra light blurring effects with <strong class="screenText">Gaussian blur</strong> to one layer, merges the layer with another layer, then turns the layer blending mode to <strong class="screenText">Add</strong>.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Bevel and emboss</strong>: This instantly adds a 3D effect to the drawing in the active layer. This is an easy way to add a lighter area to the top-left corner and a shade to the bottom right. The magic is done by creating a lighter-color copy layer of an original layer and moving it to the upper left slightly, then creating a darker-color copy of the original layer and moving it to the lower right slightly, then finally merging the copies into one layer.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Now you have<a id="_idIndexMarker1315"/> some ideas of what auto actions are, how to find them, what the <strong class="screenText">Default</strong> action set is, and what it offers. Let’s have a look at how to use auto actions next.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-303">Using auto actions</h1>
<p class="normal">In this section, we<a id="_idIndexMarker1316"/> are going to learn how to use auto actions with the eighth auto action in the <strong class="screenText">Default</strong> set, <strong class="screenText">Bright colors emit light (glow)</strong>, because it’s the easiest action set to see the result of.</p>
<p class="normal">In the main window of the <strong class="screenText">Auto Action</strong> palette are the names of the auto actions we can choose from. The right arrow to the left of the action’s name can be clicked on to view the recorded steps that comprise the action. In <em class="italic">Figure 17.6</em>, the steps under the <strong class="screenText">Bright colors emit light (glow)</strong> action are shown.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_17_17.6.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.6: Auto Action palette (2)</p>
<p class="normal">In the preceding screenshot, you can see that there are two rows of checkboxes on the left-hand side of the palette, next to the names of both the auto actions and the steps that they consist of. The first column (the one that has all the boxes checked in the screenshot) controls which steps or which entire actions are able to be<a id="_idIndexMarker1317"/> played. If the checkbox is empty, then that step or action will not play.</p>
<p class="normal">The second column of checkboxes indicates whether a step will produce a dialog box where we must enter information or make a choice. </p>
<p class="normal">In the screenshot of the <strong class="screenText">Bright colors emit light (glow)</strong> action, for example, if we click on the second column of checkboxes next to the <strong class="screenText">Gaussian blur</strong> steps, then when these steps come up in the action set when it’s played, we will get to set the options ourselves before the action continues.</p>
<p class="normal">When we select an action and click on the <strong class="screenText">Play Action</strong> button at the bottom right of the palette, or double-click the action name, the action steps will play on the currently active layer or selection. In <em class="italic">Figure 17.7</em>, the white lighting effect layer on the left has had the <strong class="screenText">Bright colors emit light (glow)</strong> action applied to it, which you can see in the result on the right, making the white lighting effect have a dramatic glow.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_17_17.7.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.7: Before and after an auto action is played (1)</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Some actions require you to have an active selection made for them to work on, instead of just playing on an entire layer. Most actions that require an active selection in the <strong class="screenText">Default</strong> action set have the <em class="italic">selected area</em> in the title, so look for this clue when playing actions!</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">We will look at<a id="_idIndexMarker1318"/> two more <strong class="screenText">Default</strong> auto actions to understand the variety of actions you can use.</p>
<p class="normal">The fourth option of the <strong class="screenText">Default</strong> set is named <strong class="screenText">Cut and move a selected subject to another layer</strong>, which, as was mentioned in the previous section in this chapter, cuts out a selected area from the active layer and pastes it on a new layer. As you can see in <em class="italic">Figure 17.8</em>, you can move the hair part from the <strong class="screenText">flats</strong> layer with one click of the <strong class="screenText">Play Action</strong> button.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_17_17.8.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.8: Before and after an auto action is played (2)</p>
<p class="normal">This will help you work on a particular area separately from other parts, such as adding a different type of shade or lighting effect to part of a character’s hair.</p>
<p class="normal">Another <strong class="screenText">Default</strong> auto action is <strong class="screenText">Bevel and emboss</strong>, which adds an instant 3D effect to a simple shape drawing, as you can see in <em class="italic">Figure 17.9.</em></p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_17_17.9.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.9: Before and after an auto action is played (3)</p>
<p class="normal">The auto action added a lighter area to the top-left side and shade to the bottom right instantly!</p>
<p class="normal">Now that we<a id="_idIndexMarker1319"/> know the uses of actions and some of the things we can do with the <strong class="screenText">Default</strong> actions, let’s create a custom action in the next section.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-304">Creating a custom auto action</h1>
<p class="normal">We’re going<a id="_idIndexMarker1320"/> to create a custom action that will set up a new file with a rough sketch, a final sketch, and ink layers with the press of a button, as I mentioned in the two different scenarios at the beginning of this chapter. You can make almost anything into an auto action, whether it’s a few button presses or a longer and more complicated series of steps. By following the instructions in this section, you’ll build the foundational knowledge you need to start creating your own actions in the future.</p>
<p class="normal">Before making an action of your own, complete the steps of the action a few times to make sure that you know the process and can remove any unnecessary steps or mistakes in its creation. This pre-planning step can help save a lot of troubleshooting later!</p>
<p class="normal">Actions are sets of menu commands executed on an existing layer or selection. Some settings and commands, such as setting the brush size, cannot be recorded. If a tool or layer is changed via a palette, this might not be added to the auto action recording.</p>
<p class="normal">Follow these steps to complete making this new auto action set and action. You will need to create a new, blank file before completing these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">In the <strong class="screenText">Auto Action</strong> palette, click on the <strong class="screenText">Create new auto action set</strong> icon to the right of the set drop-down menu. (Note that you can add new actions to the <strong class="screenText">Default</strong> folder, but for the sake of organization you can also put your own actions into a new set.)</li>
<li class="numberedList">Name the new set <strong class="screenText">Custom</strong> when the dialog box appears and click on <strong class="screenText">OK</strong> to finish creating the new set. The <strong class="screenText">Create new set</strong> dialog box is shown in <em class="italic">Figure 17.10.</em></li>

<p class="normal">You can also download auto action assets from Clip Studio Assets; read on to find out how.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-305">Downloading auto action assets</h1>
<p class="normal">There are tons<a id="_idIndexMarker1325"/> of assets available on Clip Studio Assets to download to use in your art. My favorite auto action asset is <strong class="screenText">Old Fashioned TV action (Content ID: 1741400)</strong>, which I use in the final stage of coloring art, and this auto action makes your art look like it’s on a 1970s TV screen by toning the color, adding a texture, and adding chromatic aberration. You will find out more about Clip Studio Assets features in <em class="italic">Chapter 18</em>, <em class="italic">Exploring Clip Studio Assets and Animations</em>, but for now, let’s concentrate on downloading and using auto action assets. Follow these steps:</p>

<p class="normal">If you have auto <a id="_idIndexMarker1332"/>actions that you use all the time, you can assign them to shortcut keys or even add them to the Command Bar at the top of the Clip Studio Paint interface.</p>
<p class="normal">In the next two sections, we are going to take the <strong class="screenText">Layer Set Up</strong> action we created previously and create two shortcuts for it – one keyboard shortcut and one Command Bar shortcut! This is an easy process and will cut down the amount of time you spend going through palettes, trying to find the commands that you use most often. Let’s look at both of these processes to create easy access to our auto actions.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-307">Creating a keyboard shortcut</h2>
<p class="normal">Follow these steps to<a id="_idIndexMarker1333"/> create a keyboard shortcut for an auto action:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">In the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu, click on <strong class="screenText">CLIP STUDIO PAINT</strong> or its icon and then click on <strong class="screenText">Shortcut Settings…</strong> in the drop-down menu to open the keyboard shortcut preferences.</li>
<li class="numberedList">In the <strong class="screenText">Category</strong> drop-down menu, select the <strong class="screenText">Auto actions</strong> option.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on the arrow to the left of the auto action set name to view the actions under that set name. In <em class="italic">Figure 17.23</em>, we are looking at the actions in the <strong class="screenText">Custom</strong> set to find the <strong class="screenText">Layer Set Up</strong> action we created earlier.</li>
</ol>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 17.23: Shortcut Settings window (1)</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="4">Click on the <strong class="screenText">Layer Set Up</strong> name to select it. Then, click on the <strong class="screenText">Edit shortcut</strong> button.</li>
<li class="numberedList">On the keyboard, press the key or combination of keys you’d like to use for the shortcut. In this set of instructions, we are going to use the <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">T1</em> combination<a id="_idIndexMarker1334"/> of keys to activate our auto action. This shortcut now appears next to the <strong class="screenText">Layer Set Up</strong> auto action’s name, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 17.24.</em></li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="6">To change an existing shortcut to something else, click on <strong class="screenText">Edit shortcut</strong> and choose a new shortcut. You can also configure these shortcuts on your device.</li>
<li class="numberedList">To add another shortcut to the same auto action, click on the <strong class="screenText">Add shortcut</strong> button and press another key or combination of keys to set a second shortcut.</li>
<li class="numberedList">To delete a shortcut, select the shortcut and then click on the <strong class="screenText">Delete shortcut</strong> button.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Once you have finished setting shortcuts, click on the <strong class="screenText">OK</strong> button to exit <strong class="screenText">Shortcut Settings</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">Now, when you hold down the <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> button and press <em class="italic">F1</em> on the keyboard, your <strong class="screenText">Layer Set Up</strong> action<a id="_idIndexMarker1335"/> will play.</p>
<p class="normal">Read on to find out about another shortcut you can create!</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-308">Creating a command bar shortcut</h2>
<p class="normal">It’s nice to be able <a id="_idIndexMarker1336"/>to see your frequently used shortcuts on the command bar. To add a shortcut icon to the command bar, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">In the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu, click on <strong class="screenText">CLIP STUDIO PAINT</strong> or its icon and then click on<strong class="screenText"> Command Bar Settings…</strong> in its drop-down menu to bring up the <strong class="screenText">Command Bar Settings</strong> menu.</li>
<li class="numberedList">In the drop-down menu at the top of the settings menu, select the <strong class="screenText">Auto Action</strong> option to view the auto actions.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on the arrow next to the action set to view the names of the auto actions beneath that set. In <em class="italic">Figure 17.25</em>, we are looking at the <strong class="screenText">Custom</strong> set for the <strong class="screenText">Layer Set Up</strong> action.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_17_17.25.png"/></figure>

<li class="numberedList" value="4">With the name of the auto action selected, click on the <strong class="screenText">Add</strong> button.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="5">The shortcut icon <a id="_idIndexMarker1337"/>will now show in the command bar, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 17.26.</em></li>
</ol>

<li class="numberedList" value="6">To delete a shortcut, press and hold the shortcut icon to open a drop-down menu, and then click <strong class="screenText">Delete</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">Wow, how accessible it is to get the auto action done on your layers. You can either press and hold the <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> key and then press the <em class="italic">F1</em> key or click on the icon in the command bar<a id="_idIndexMarker1338"/> to run the <strong class="screenText">Layer Set Up</strong> action without having to select it from the palette.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-309">Summary</h1>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we learned how to make tedious activities more bearable by using recorded auto actions to automate their steps. We looked at the <strong class="screenText">Auto Action</strong> palette and learned how to play a default action. We learned how to create a new auto action set, how to create a new auto action and record the steps for it, and then how to download an auto action asset. Finally, we learned how to create two different shortcuts to an auto action in order to make accessing it easier.</p>
<p class="normal">In the next chapter, we will explore the animation features of Clip Studio Paint and learn how to import materials and other assets from Clip Studio Assets.</p>
