    and vector images. In fact, rasters and vectors can be used on different layers
    of the same canvas by simply creating the corresponding layer type. Creating vectors
    in Clip Studio Paint, however, is different in many ways compared to other vector
    programs.

- en: Vector images are different from raster images. Raster images are made up of
    small squares of color, called pixels. Raster images are used in many situations,
    but they do have some disadvantages – primarily that since they are composed of
    pixels, they lose quality when made larger. Vector images are made of points that
    are connected together in the program and can be edited on the fly and resized
    at will without any loss in quality.

- en: In this chapter, we started off by getting familiar with vectors. We learned
    what a vector is and how vectors in Clip Studio Paint differ from vectors in other
    programs. We learned how to create a vector layer and how to draw on it with both
    the direct drawing tools and the brush tools. Finally, we learned about the different
    tools we can use to fine-tune our vector drawings.

    also create your own sound effects in Clip Studio Paint? In the next chapter,
    we’ll learn about editing, modifying, coloring, and wrapping up text, while also
    getting creative by adding sound effects.
