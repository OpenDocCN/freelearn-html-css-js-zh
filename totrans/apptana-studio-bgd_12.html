<span class="emphasis"><em>At times we may encounter problems while working with Aptana Studio. These problems often depend on the operating system used, the Aptana Studio plugins, or the Aptana Studio configuration. It's important to know how to get the required information out of Aptana Studio in order to solve your problems. But the possible problems could be very varied.</em></span>
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>For this reason, we can't solve all these possible problems easily or in the same way. Furthermore, it might happen that you find a completely new problem or bug within Aptana Studio. Therefore, we will take a look at a few of the most frequently occurring problems, and what you can to do to solve these problems. We will also discuss the procedure that you will need to follow to solve those problems with Aptana Studio that you're not able to solve by yourself.</em></span>
</p><p>So, in this chapter we will cover the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What to do when problems occur</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to configure the system error level</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Where can you find the logfiles content</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Where you can get additional support</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to report a bug ticket</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="What to do when problems occur"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl1sec157"/>What to do when problems occur</h1></div></div></div><p>First of all, we will see where you can find some additional information or help in case you have some questions or need some help.</p><div class="section" title="Systems help"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl2sec168"/>Systems help</h2></div></div></div><p>If you have any questions about the main features of <a id="id706" class="indexterm"/>Aptana Studio, first take a look at the <span class="strong"><strong>Help Contents</strong></span> menu<a id="id707" class="indexterm"/>.

These help topics are provided by the eclipse framework, <a id="id711" class="indexterm"/>which is located under the hood. Another important entry is the <span class="strong"><strong>Studio User </strong></span><a id="id712" class="indexterm"/><span class="strong"><strong>Guide</strong></span> option.

As you have already read, you can try and solve these problems by writing a <a id="id714" class="indexterm"/>forum post or creating a bug ticket. But stop!</p><p>Before you go ahead and post something on the forums or report a bug, you should try to solve the problem by yourself.</p><p>A possible process of solving your problems could be performing a system update. Maybe your  problem results from a bug in Aptana Studio or an integrated plugin. After a system update, the whole IDE should work with the newest source—maybe your problem was related to an older version <a id="id715" class="indexterm"/>and is now solved. How to run a system update has already been discussed in  Chapter 1, Getting Started.</p><p>If the problem still remains, you should start a search for the problem. Have a look—is there an error message? Could you describe your problem in words? Take all this information and feed it into your preferred search engine. This search <a id="id716" class="indexterm"/>
<a id="id717" class="indexterm"/>will surely give you some tips on how to solve your problem.</p><p>If your problem still remains and the search gives you no effective results, try providing your search with the version and system information from Aptana Studio.

Click on it, and you <a id="id719" class="indexterm"/>will get an overview of the installation details of Aptana Studio.<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8246_12_03.jpg" alt="Time for action – displaying installation details"/></div></li><li class="listitem">On the first tab, you will find a complete list of the installed software that is integrated in the system.<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8246_12_04.jpg" alt="Time for action – displaying installation details"/></div></li><li class="listitem">The second tab provides you with the installation history. This is very useful! The installation history gets an additional entry every time you install a new plugin or run an update. In the upper area, you will find the dates and times when some activity was performed. If you click on one of these entries, the list that appears below shows you what kind of installation and plugins you had at that moment. You also have the option here to revert the changes that you had made. The following <a id="id720" class="indexterm"/>screenshot shows you the <span class="strong"><strong>Installation History</strong></span> tab:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8246_12_05.jpg" alt="Time for action – displaying installation details"/></div></li><li class="listitem">The next tab is the <span class="strong"><strong>Features</strong></span> tab, gives you an overview of the installed features.

Sometimes, it's very useful to read the logfile if you have problems with Aptana Studio.</p><p>This will allow you (with the help of the logged warnings and errors) to identify the source of your problems.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Time for action &#x2013; viewing and clearing the logfile"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl1sec159"/>Time for action – viewing and clearing the logfile</h1></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Help</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Aptana</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>View Log File</strong></span>.</li><li class="listitem">That's it!

Often, when you search for a problem within the logfile, it can be hard to find the entries that are relevant to your problem due to the large amount of information which can be found there. If this is the case, you should clear the current logfile, run the problematic part again where your problem had occurred, and then view the logfile once more.</li><li class="listitem">Clearing the logfile is as easy as the last step. <a id="id729" class="indexterm"/>Just navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Help</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Aptana</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Clear Log File</strong></span> and the logfile will be cleared.</li></ol></div><div class="section" title="What just happened?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl2sec173"/>
<span class="emphasis"><em>What just happened?</em></span>
</h2></div></div></div><p>We just took a look into the logfile. The logfile is generally very large and therefore it's not so easy to read out the relevant information. Aptana Studio 3 provides a functionality to clear the logfile, something which we also looked at.</p><p>If the logfile doesn't contain the information you need, navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> and select the <span class="strong"><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></span> entry under <span class="strong"><strong>Aptana Studio</strong></span>.

<a class="ulink" href="http://aptana.com/support">http://aptana.com/support</a>
</p><p>Here, you will find an overview of the different support possibilities. In this case, we want to get in contact with other Aptana Studio users in order to exchange information about your problem. Aptana has its own discussion forum named <span class="emphasis"><em>Tender app, </em></span>which can be found on its website, but the team has decided to move the forum to <a class="ulink" href="http://stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow.com</a>. <a id="id731" class="indexterm"/>StackOverflow has a very large community of knowledgeable individuals, and they often respond much quicker than the Appcelerator team.</p><p>At StackOverflow you can create a new question and give it the tag <span class="strong"><strong>aptana</strong></span>. The tag <span class="strong"><strong>aptana</strong></span> allows StackOverflow to inform all the users that have subscribed to Aptana-tagged questions, and also to categorize the question with other Aptana Studio questions.</p><p>Don't forget to mention your Aptana Studio Version in your post and other problem-related information.</p><p>Good luck with the posting and discussion with the other <a id="id732" class="indexterm"/>Aptana Studio users and some Appcelerator team members, who are often available there to help.</p></div>
