This book tries to bridge that gap.</p><p>It uses complete examples that take you from basic shapes on a page to full-blown examples. There is no magic here, no steps are left unexplained. You will understand everything that goes into making a visualization with d3.js.</p><p>We'll touch everything from manipulating data to make it easier to work with, to using advanced features to separate drawing from calculating coordinates.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Getting Started with d3.js">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Getting Started with d3.js</em></span>, gives a simple example to show you the basics of d3.js and helps you to set up a common environment, which is used throughout the rest of the book.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. A Primer on DOM, SVG, and CSS">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>A Primer on DOM, SVG, and CSS</em></span>, explains in detail how to use d3.js for manipulating content on a page, paying special attention to SVG and the core tools for creating images.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Making Data Useful">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Making Data Useful</em></span>, shows you how to manipulate data in a functional manner, load data from external sources, and use the built-in tools of d3.js to avoid tedious coding.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Making Things Move">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Making Things Move</em></span>, talks about animating visualizations with d3.js and allowing users to interact with your images.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Layouts – d3's Black Magic">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Layouts – d3's Black Magic</em></span>, explains how d3.js layouts work and shows you how to use the same dataset to get vastly different images. The fancy visualizations out there will no longer look like magic.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Designing Good Visualizations">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Designing Good Visualizations</em></span>, looks at a few examples of great visualizations from around the web and discusses just what it is that makes them great.</p></div></div></div>


  <div id="sbo-rt-content"><div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>You don't need much to play along with the examples. A machine geared for web development will have everything.</p><p>We assumed the Chrome browser in the examples, but everything should work in Safari, Firefox, and Internet Explorer Version 10 and above. The specific browser only affects how your debugging tools work, but they're very similar in all browsers anyway.</p><p>We also use Python to run a small server. If you're using Mac or Linux, Python is already installed; otherwise, you've to get a version. The only thing we ever do with Python is run a single command.</p><p>And lastly, you are going to need a text editor. Personally I like Emacs, but Sublime and Notepad++ are also popular choices. Yes, you can use Vim too.</p></div></div>

By the end of this book, you will be able to understand code from even the fanciest visualizations.</p></div></div>
