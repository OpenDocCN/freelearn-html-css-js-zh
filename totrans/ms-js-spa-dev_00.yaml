- en: Created in 1995 by Brendan Eich of Netscape, JavaScript has gone from being
    a toy scripting language used only in browsers to being one of the most popular
    languages in the world for full-stack development. With the introduction of Node.js,
    built on top of Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine, developers are now able to build
    powerful and performant applications using JavaScript. With the addition of MongoDB,
    a modern NoSQL database, applications can utilize JavaScript at every tier.

- en: Many popular web applications are implemented, partially or in whole, as single-page
    applications, or SPAs. With SPAs, users load a single web page, and that page
    is updated dynamically in response to user interaction or incoming server data.
    The advantage is an application experience that is smoother, replicates native
    application interaction, and may require less network traffic and server load.

- en: The MEAN stack is a set of JavaScript tools representing a full stack, from
    database to runtime environment, application framework, and frontend. This book
    provides a thorough background in building SPAs using the MEAN stack and other
    tools in the JavaScript ecosystem. It covers the basics of SPA architecture and
    JavaScript tools. The book then expands to more advanced topics, such as building,
    securing, and deploying an SPA built with the MEAN stack.

    *Getting Organized NPM*, Bower, and Grunt, introduces JavaScript frontend package-management,
    build, and task-running tools. These tools form the foundation for you to set
    up an ideal development environment.'

    goes beyond the original MVC design pattern and explores its translation into
    frontend frameworks and its evolution into Model-View-*, or Model-View-Whatever
    (MVW), in which the Controller layer is more open ended and often abstracted into
    other layers more suited to an SPA environment.'

    Environment"), *SPA Essentials - Creating the Ideal Application Environment*,
    introduces you to the common components/layers of an SPA, the best practices and
    variations around these components, and how to put them together and lay the groundwork
    for a modern SPA.'

    Side of Your App"), *REST is Best - Interacting with the Server Side of Your Application*,
    goes into further detail about the server side of SPA architecture—in particular,
    with regard to the REST (representational state transfer) architectural pattern.
    You’ll become familiar with different methods to interact with a REST API using
    JavaScript and AJAX, with practical examples.'

    the View*, focuses on the concept of views in the SPA architecture and how views
    can be initialized in a single-page container. It discusses JavaScript templates
    and provides examples from different libraries, going deeper into how AngularJS
    views are implemented.'

    It"), *Data Binding, and Why You Should Embrace It*, teaches you about data binding,
    describes one-way versus two-way data binding, and discusses the practicality
    of data binding in an SPA and why you should use it. You will also cover the continual
    evolution of the ECMAScript/JavaScript standard and how it now supports native
    data binding in some clients.'
