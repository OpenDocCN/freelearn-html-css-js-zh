<p class="mce-root">ServiceNow is gradually evolving as the platform of choice for IT Service management. Industry giants such as RedHat and NetApp have adopted ServiceNow for their operational needs. ServiceNow provides clients with an extra add-on when it comes to their baseline instances, as scripting can be used to customize and improve the performance of their instances. ServiceNow provides inbuilt JavaScript API for scripting and improving an instance using JavaScript.</p>
<p class="mce-root">This book will initially cover the basics of ServiceNow scripting and the appropriate time to script in a ServiceNow environment. Then, we will dig deeper into client-side and server-side scripting using JavaScipt API. We will also cover advanced concepts such as on-demand functions, script actions, and best practices. This book will act as an end-to-end guide to writing, testing, and debugging scripts in ServiceNow. We will also cover update sets for moving customizations between ServiceNow instances, Jelly scripts for making custom pages, and best practices for all types of script in ServiceNow.</p>
<p class="mce-root">At the end of this book, you will have hands-on experience of scripting in ServiceNow using the inbuilt JavaScript API.</p>

<p>Before starting with Mastering ServiceNow Scripting, it is advised that you have a good understanding of the ServiceNow platform. It is advisable to have a system administrator certification or similar knowledge, and to be aware of forms, lists, and tables in ServiceNow. You should also be able to comfortably navigate around a ServiceNow instance.</p>
<p>Some knowledge of JavaScript will be advantageous, but is not compulsory as the examples given will give you script to try and get started with.</p>
<p>It is advised to have a ServiceNow instance that you can use to try out the examples and create some scripts of your own. If you do not have an instance at this point, personal developer instances (PDI's) can be requested from ServiceNow for users who would like to improve their ServiceNow skills.</p>
