    for you, or what your team is using right now. It is also probable that by the

    is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity*." Pretty
    nice introduction. Facebook maintains this project, and it currently has over
    32,000 stars on GitHub. I'm not saying this is what makes a project a good project,

    of the things to take into consideration.

    and each test is an `it` or `test` function. You can skip tests with `describe.skip`,
    `it.skip`, or `test.skip`. You can run only one test with `describe.only`, `it.only`,
    or `test.only`. You also have `beforeEach`, `afterEach`, `beforeAll`, and `afterAll`,
    to run setup and cleanup code.

    **Snapshot** tool. The snapshot tool would process a React component and return
    some kind of DOM representation as JSON, which will allow us to test whether the
    DOM created by the component has changed. Is this a kind of UI test? Sure it is!

    a helper.
