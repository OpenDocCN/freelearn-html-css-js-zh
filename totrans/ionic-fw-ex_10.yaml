    features that we did not cover as they were beyond the scope of this book. We
    mostly focused on the core features of Ionic, such as how to get Ionic set up.
    We then learned to create Ionic apps using the blank, side menu, and tabs templates.
    We also learned to test our Ionic application using the Chrome browser via the
    `ionic serve` technique.

- en: This is the drag-and-drop tool built by Ionic for people who want to design
    their first app or people with limited coding skills. Its greatest feature is
    that anything you design by dragging and dropping Ionic elements can be tested
    in the browser, and the code can be extracted as a ready-to-go application. This
    is great news for designers who don't know how to code as they can quickly use
    the visual drag-and-drop features of the Ionic creator to design their apps and
    pass on the code to seasoned developers. You can visit the Ionic creator website
    at [https://creator.ionic.io](https://creator.ionic.io).

    of Ionic, you will still want to see a real code sample. Or maybe you want to
    try to reproduce a bug to show others. This is where the Ionic code pen site shines.
    It is a place where you can find some really great implementations of different
    features with the code available for you to learn from. It is also the best way
    to showcase a bug to people who can see it and help you resolve any issues.

    like **Push** **Notification**, **Analytics**, and the ability to build your app
    for the app store in the cloud. There is also Ionic deploy, which is a feature
    that lets you update your app live without resubmitting it to the app store.

    they were free at the time of writing, Ionic has announced that they will be paid
    services in future. This is something that you should closely follow as you might
    find yourself needing to use some of the services provided by the Ionic.IO platform.

    It is a great way to simply spin off code and have it show you the results right
    there in the browser. I personally see this tool as very useful in the educational
    world as it makes it easy to create Ionic applications with only a browser.
