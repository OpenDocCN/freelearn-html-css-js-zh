<h1 class="chapterTitle" id="_idParaDest-173">Material Palette and Inking Special Effects</h1>
<p class="normal">Sometimes, inking requires us to answer a set of questions relating to how to render something. How can we make a textured, grungy look? How can we use the digital space to make repetitive inking tasks easier and more efficient? Becoming familiar with the other drawing tools and how to customize them is the best way to save time when drawing. When you have a core understanding of how to create and customize tools, you can make special ones that solve problems and speed up your workflow.</p>
<p class="normal">Digital art materials are a contentious topic, as over-relying on them is sometimes seen as cheating. The important thing to remember is that the materials used for custom brushes still need to be drawn; you still need to know how to draw the materials, it just saves the repetition of drawing hundreds of leaves or blades of grass. Making custom tools that can create a grungy effect, make lightning, or even create a crowd scene for us is no more cheating than using a ruler or a compass on a piece of paper.</p>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we will learn how to use the Material palette and build a foundation that will allow you to create your own custom tools. Each exercise is designed to build on the skills learned in the previous one to take you through the different options in the brush engine. The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>

</ul>
<p class="normal">Let’s get going right away!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-174">Technical requirements</h1>
<p class="normal">To get started, you need Clip Studio Paint installed on your device, and a new canvas should be open without any background color. Any size is fine, but I recommend creating a 300 dpi square canvas to go through the content of this chapter.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-175">Exploring the Material palette</h1>
<p class="normal">Did you know <a id="_idIndexMarker671"/>you can save your art to the <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> palette <a id="_idIndexMarker672"/>for later use in brushes, patterns, designs, backgrounds, and more? It certainly is one of the most useful techniques to have in digital drawing!</p>
<p class="normal">In this section, we are going to take a design and save it to the <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> palette so that it can be used as a design on a character’s shirt. First, though, let’s take a look at the <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> palette categories, which are shown in <em class="italic">Figure 9.1</em>.</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_9_9.1.png"/></p>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.1: The Material palette</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Color pattern</strong> contains patterns and background assets that are in color. Most of these assets are seamless tiles, but not all of them. They are separated into subcategories according to type.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Monochromatic pattern</strong> is for black and white patterns, backgrounds, and textures. Included in this category are many different types of screentone patterns for manga creation.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Manga material</strong> contains assets such as framing templates for comic page creation, speech balloons, sound effects, and effect lines.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Image material</strong> contains illustrations and photo assets, as well as brush tip material assets.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">3D</strong> contains all 3D assets. For more information on 3D materials, see <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 14</em>, <em class="italic">Using 3D Figures and Objects</em>.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Download</strong> contains any assets downloaded from the Clip Studio Paint app. For more information on downloading new materials, see <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 18</em>, <em class="italic">Exploring the Clip Studio Assets and Animation</em>.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Favorite</strong> contains any materials you add to the Favorite category by pressing the heart-shaped icon at the bottom of the palette when a particular material is selected. It’s a good idea to favorite any frequently used materials.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Now that we<a id="_idIndexMarker673"/> know<a id="_idIndexMarker674"/> about the different types of assets in the <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> palette, we should learn how to save our own artwork to the palette as well. Let’s see how to do that in the next section.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-176">Saving artwork to the Material palette</h2>
<p class="normal">There are many <a id="_idIndexMarker675"/>reasons why we might want to save<a id="_idIndexMarker676"/> a piece of art to the <strong class="screenText">Material </strong>palette. Perhaps it’s the title logo for your comic series and you want to be able to easily add it to your covers. Maybe it’s a watermark that you intend to put over any image that you post online to deter art theft. Maybe it’s a special speech balloon you designed for the villain of your manga, or it’s a special repeating plaid pattern for your protagonist’s outfit. You can also lay out complex tattoos and save them to the <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> palette so that you can use them again instead of drawing them over and over every time you draw the character. Alternatively, you can create a T-shirt design for a character and simply paste it in and edit it slightly to fit the angle your character is standing at instead of redrawing the design each time!</p>
<p class="normal">The possibilities with materials are limited only by your own imagination, and the preceding points are just a few ideas of ways to use them.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s use the artwork shown below as an example. We’ll learn how to save your art assets to the Material palette and then apply them to your drawings:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_9_9.2.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.2: Example material design</p>
<p class="normal">I have left the design with a transparent background because it will be used for a character’s clothing<a id="_idIndexMarker677"/> in <a id="_idIndexMarker678"/>another creation so that, later, I will be able to change the color of the clothing by isolating the design itself from the selection.</p>
<p class="normal">The following steps will walk you through the process of saving an image to the <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> palette:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">If your image is made of multiple layers, either flatten the image or go to the <strong class="screenText">[Layer] menu | Merge visible to new layer</strong> to create a new layer with a copy of the layers on it. Only the contents of the currently active layer will be saved to the <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> palette, so make sure that all of the parts of the image that are going to be saved are on the same layer and that this layer is selected before continuing.</li>
<li class="numberedList">In the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu, click on <strong class="screenText">Edit</strong>, select <strong class="screenText">Register Material</strong>, and click on <strong class="screenText">Image…</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="3">The <strong class="screenText">Material property</strong> window will appear, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_9_9.3_.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.3: The Material property window</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="4">Enter a name<a id="_idIndexMarker679"/> in<a id="_idIndexMarker680"/> the <strong class="screenText">Material name</strong> text entry box.</li>
<li class="numberedList">The <strong class="screenText">Material image</strong> box will show a preview of the image that is being saved. If this image isn’t correct, click on the <strong class="screenText">Cancel</strong> button and follow the instructions in <em class="italic">step 1</em> to ensure that your image is all on one layer.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Under <strong class="screenText">Paste operation</strong>, make sure that the <strong class="screenText">Scale up/down</strong> option is checked, and that <strong class="screenText">Adjust after pasting</strong> is selected in the drop-down menu. This will allow us to resize the material after adding it to the canvas.</li>
<li class="numberedList">The <strong class="screenText">Specify order in Layer palette</strong> setting allows us to choose where in the stack of layers the material will be added. For instance, if we were adding a background image, we could select the <strong class="screenText">Background etc</strong>. option so that the image will always be pasted beneath the other layers in the stack. Since we are creating a clothing design for this example, we will select <strong class="screenText">Effect etc</strong>. so that the design will appear over the top of the characters.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Choose the desired category to save the <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> under in the <strong class="screenText">Choose save location</strong> window. In this example, we are using the <strong class="screenText">Image Material | Illustration | Decoration</strong> folder to save this design.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on the icon in the lower-right corner of the <strong class="screenText">Search tag</strong> window to add tags to the material. I always recommend using a unique tag on any materials you create and save so that you can find all of your assets quickly. I used the tag <strong class="screenText">clothing</strong>, but you can come up with your own name, or maybe even the name of your comic project if that is what you want!</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on <strong class="screenText">OK</strong> to save the design to the palette.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">Once our image <a id="_idIndexMarker681"/>is saved, we<a id="_idIndexMarker682"/> can view it in the <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> palette. In the following screenshot, the <strong class="screenText">Phoenix kamon</strong> design (which I saved by following the preceding instructions) is shown under <strong class="screenText">All materials</strong> at the top of the list, since it has just been added:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_9_9.4.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.4: The Material palette</p>
<p class="normal">By selecting the<a id="_idIndexMarker683"/> material <a id="_idIndexMarker684"/>and clicking on the <strong class="screenText">Paste selected material to canvas</strong> icon at the bottom of the <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> palette, the material will be added to the currently active canvas. The <strong class="screenText">Paste selected material to canvas</strong> icon looks as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_9_9.5.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.5: The Paste selected material to canvas icon</p>
<p class="normal">In the following screenshot, the design has been added to the character’s clothing, so now you don’t need to redraw the image over and over again in every scene where the same character appears in your manga! Just to note, to make the design fit the clothing, we can click <strong class="screenText">Edit</strong> in the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu, select <strong class="screenText">Transform</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Mesh transform…,</strong> and then move control handles to shape the design.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_9_9.6.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.6: Artwork with the pasted material</p>
<p class="normal">I’m sure you have<a id="_idIndexMarker685"/> a<a id="_idIndexMarker686"/> variety of designs you would like to use in your manga, and now you know how to store and use them without going through the hassle of creating them again and again!</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">This tip will save you a lot of time! Create a panel layer folder that contains a page full of panels before being divided into shapes, layers with speech balloon samples for each of the fonts used in your manga, a sketch layer, and an ink layer. Then, click the folder and drag it into the <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> palette where your desired category is already open.</p>
<p class="normal">This can be used for the following pages as you continue to draw the manga series, and you don’t have to recreate the set all over again. On each new manga page, just click on the <strong class="screenText">Paste selected material to canvas</strong> icon! Now all <a id="_idIndexMarker687"/>you <a id="_idIndexMarker688"/>need to do is to edit the elements without creating them from scratch.</p>

<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-177">Creating a textured inking brush</h1>
<p class="normal">In this section, we <a id="_idIndexMarker689"/>will use the materials we have explored to <a id="_idIndexMarker690"/>create a textured inking brush that will help us depict a certain grungy look. This exercise will get us familiar with creating and saving a custom brush tip and adjusting some of the brush tip settings in the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool Detail</strong> palette. Complete the following steps to make this textured inking brush:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">On a new canvas, create a new raster layer. Make sure that<strong class="screenText"> Expression color</strong> in the <strong class="screenText">Layer Property</strong> palette is set to <strong class="screenText">Gray</strong>.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Select the <strong class="screenText">Airbrush</strong> tool and the <strong class="screenText">Droplet</strong> sub-tool. On the gray layer, make a circular shape with the <strong class="screenText">Droplet</strong> tool, using pure black as the active color. Don’t make this too precise; we want some variation to it. Your shape should look something like in <em class="italic">Figure 9.7</em>.</li>

We will create a brush that will make shards of broken glass rain down on our images. Follow these steps to create this brush:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Open a blank canvas, preferably at least 300 dpi. You do not need to use the <strong class="screenText">Paper</strong> option in this canvas; in fact, we want a transparent background.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Using your preferred drawing tools on an empty layer, draw the outline of several jagged, broken glass shapes. Use black or dark gray for the outlines.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Create a new layer beneath the outline layer. In this layer, fill the glass shapes with solid white.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Lower the opacity of the white layer to 50% by using the slider at the top right of the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Merge the outline layer with the 50% transparent white layer by clicking on <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> in the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu and clicking on <strong class="screenText">Merge visible layers</strong>.

<p class="normal">By changing the <strong class="screenText">Thickness</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Angle</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Repeat method</strong> options to <strong class="screenText">Random</strong>, we get a random<a id="_idIndexMarker719"/> rotation and direction of the glass shard <a id="_idIndexMarker720"/>shapes as we use the brush. By changing the <strong class="screenText">Gap</strong> option, we make the brush tip shapes show up far apart from each other, instead of in a continuous stroke like with other drawing tools.</p>
<p class="normal">You can also use perspective transformation to change glass sizes at once.

<p class="normal">Next, we will create a brush that helps us draw different aspects of nature. With a customized <a id="_idIndexMarker721"/>foliage brush, you can draw a tree<a id="_idIndexMarker722"/> and its leaves super easily! Let’s have you make your own by following the steps in the next section.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-179">Creating a foliage brush</h1>
<p class="normal">I don’t think I <a id="_idIndexMarker723"/>need <a id="_idIndexMarker724"/>to keep it a secret that the foliage brush is one of my favorite specialty brushes ever created. This brush makes drawing detailed trees and bushes easier, and it introduces us to the <strong class="screenText">Ribbon</strong> options in the brush details.</p>
<p class="normal">In the following set of steps, we will create a leafy material and then make it into a brush that rolls out like a spool of ribbon:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Open a new blank canvas with at least 300 dpi resolution.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Using an inking pen, draw a row of leaves similar to the top of a tree or bush.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Fill the leaves with white. Use the following screenshot as a guide to create your leaves and the white fill. You need a transparent background as we had in the previous sections of this chapter.</li>
<li class="numberedList">From the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu, click <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Merge visible layers</strong>. The image is now similar to the following screenshot:</li>

<li class="numberedList">Finally, enter a few tags by clicking on the <strong class="screenText">+</strong> icon at the bottom of the <strong class="screenText">Search tag</strong> window.

<p class="normal">This <a id="_idIndexMarker735"/>brush <a id="_idIndexMarker736"/>works best when it’s used in layers. To understand what I mean, let’s look at the process of creating a tree using this tool.</p>
<p class="normal">After sketching the trunk of the tree and the general shape of the leaves at the top, use the brush to go around the outline of the top. Work in a clockwise direction to ensure that the bottom leaves are in the correct orientation. Look at the following screenshot and note the direction of the arrows. This is the direction we are working in:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_09_9.31.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.31: Foliage brush’s brushstrokes</p>
<p class="normal">Not bad, but<a id="_idIndexMarker737"/> it<a id="_idIndexMarker738"/> could look better! By continuing to work in the same clockwise direction, but slightly inside of the already-existing leaves, we can make more layers of foliage that will grow outward from the tree branches, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_09_9.32.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 9.32: Foliage brush’s brushstrokes with layers</p>
<p class="normal">By using the <strong class="screenText">Ribbon</strong> setting, we get a brush that repeats in a pattern, unrolling like a <a id="_idIndexMarker739"/>pattern <a id="_idIndexMarker740"/>printed on tape. This is also what allows us to get the pattern to go upside down to make the bottom leaves without having to create a second brush with the brush tip material upside down. Layering the leaves gives us a detailed finished product!</p>
<p class="normal">By using the <strong class="screenText">Ribbon</strong> option and playing with the <strong class="screenText">Repeat</strong> method, we can make brushes that simulate patterned fabric trim, lace, ruffles, knit patterns, and even shoelaces!</p>
<div><p class="normal">Overly relying on material brushes can cause your art to look generic, especially when multiple compositions use the same brushes. To get a more organic look, you should start hand drawing the elements of your artwork instead.</p>
<p class="normal">Alternatively, try making new materials by hand so that you have a bigger variety to choose from. You can also go over the results of the material brush with hand-drawn details.</p>
<p class="normal">In short, material brushes are convenient tools to create foundations, which you finalize in your art yourself.</p>

<p class="normal">In <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 18</em>, <em class="italic">Exploring the Clip Studio Assets and Animation</em>, we will learn how to access the Clip Studio Paint Assets download library, where you can get more ideas for custom tools to make or download tools made by other users.</p>
<p class="normal">Next, we will <a id="_idIndexMarker741"/>look <a id="_idIndexMarker742"/>at one of the most useful brushes – the cross-hatching brush. Read on to find out how to create one in the next section!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-180">Texturing with a cross-hatching brush</h1>
<p class="normal">Hatching is a shading<a id="_idIndexMarker743"/> technique achieved using <a id="_idIndexMarker744"/>groups of parallel lines. Cross-hatching is a group of parallel lines that cross another group in another direction, adding texture and the appearance of darker shading. Hatching and cross-hatching can add a lovely look of depth and texture to monochromatic illustrations. By making a hatching brush, we can achieve this look without the tedium of having to make all the lines by hand. When creating your new canvas to draw your brush tip, make sure that <strong class="screenText">Basic expression color</strong> is set to <strong class="screenText">Gray</strong> instead of <strong class="screenText">Color</strong>. The following screenshot shows the drop-down menu in the new file creation window where this change can be made:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_09_9.33.png"/></figure>

<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-181">Summary</h1>
<p class="normal">This chapter has given us knowledge about the <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> palette and a foundation for making our own custom tools, and with this knowledge, you should be able to make pretty much any special brush that you can dream up! We learned how to make and save our own custom materials that can be used as brush tips. We created a grittily textured inking brush and learned how to set the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool Detail</strong> settings to get the look we wanted. We made a glass shard brush that utilized <strong class="screenText">Opacity</strong> and a <strong class="screenText">Random</strong> direction to give us the appearance of hundreds of hand-inked glass shards in an illustration. Then, we used the <strong class="screenText">Ribbon</strong> options to create a foliage brush. Finally, we used the parallel line ruler to create a brush tip material and used the <strong class="screenText">Direction of line</strong> brush option to create a layered cross-hatching brush.</p>
<p class="normal">In the next chapter, we are going to move on to how to use vector layers. We will have a closer look at how vector layers are different from raster layers, which have a few different capabilities that might be useful for you.</p>
