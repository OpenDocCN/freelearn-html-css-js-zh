- en: Now that we have explored using grade-written assignments with a rubric, the
    **Quiz** feature of Google Forms will help grade multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank,
    and numeric questions. First, you will need to create the assignment and deploy
    it on Google Classroom. Google Forms' app within Google's Workspace for Education
    allows you to create online surveys, which you can use as assignments. The results
    are found within Google Forms or are linked to a Google Sheet.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: After using Quiz with Google Forms for assignments, you may decide to also use
    it for exams. However, while Google Forms provides a means for creating the assessment
    and Google Classroom allows you to easily distribute it to your students, there
    are limited tools for maintaining the security of an assessment. Security for
    Google Forms can only be ensured when students are using Chromebooks enrolled
    in the school network.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, if you choose to use this tool for summative assessment, you will
    need to determine an appropriate level of security. (Often, there is nothing that
    prevents students from opening a new tab and searching for an answer or messaging
    classmates when completing a form remotely.) For example, in my classroom, I adjusted
    the desks so that there was room at the back of the classroom to pace during a
    summative assessment. Additionally, some school labs have a teacher desktop that
    includes software to monitor student desktops. Whatever method you choose, take
    precautions to ensure the authenticity of student results when assessing students
    online.

    its functionality. Therefore, the various features you will explore in this chapter
    will focus on creating and assessing multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank assignments.
    However, once you are familiar with Google Forms, you will find additional applications
    for it. For example, in my school, I work with administration to create forms
    to collect survey data from stakeholders such as staff, students, and parents.

- en: Recently, for our school's annual Open House, I created a form to guide prospective
    students through selecting their first-year courses (the COVID-19 pandemic prevented
    in-person consultations with schools during registration). Also, during our school's
    major fundraiser, I developed a Google Form for students to record donations so
    that reports could be generated from the information more quickly than ever before.
    The possibilities of using Google Forms within a school environment are endless!

    a higher grade if they redo the assignment, you may want to prevent students from
    resubmitting a Google Form, for example, if you use a Google Form as a quiz. In
