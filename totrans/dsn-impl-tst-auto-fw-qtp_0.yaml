- en: HP QuickTest Professional is a test automation tool for functional and regression
    testing for software applications and environments. HP QuickTest Professional
    supports keyword and scripting interfaces and features a graphical user interface.
    It uses the Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript) to specify a test procedure
    and to manipulate the objects and controls of the application under testing.

- en: This book is a great platform for sharing my knowledge of designing and implementing
    the test automation framework that I have acquired over the years, while working
    in Information Technology and teaching QTP to professionals. If any professional
    or student finds it difficult to implement frameworks, this is the right book—one
    which teaches approaches and concepts with simple examples. This book covers the
    managerial, technical, and design concepts, and is uniquely designed to deliver
    the knowledge needed to create an effective framework. It demonstrates easy ways
    to implement and learn concepts, along with code and suggestions for creating
    a portable framework across various versions of QTP.
