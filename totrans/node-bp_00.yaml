- en: As you probably know, the big things in our sphere are those that are moved
    by the community. Node.js is a technology that has become really popular. Its
    ecosystem is well-designed and brings with it the flexibility we need. With the
    rise of mobile development, JavaScript occupies a big part of the technology stack
    nowadays. The ability to use JavaScript on the server side is really interesting.
    It's good to know how Node.js works and where and when to use it, but it is more
    important to see some examples. This book will show you how this wonderful technology
    handles real use cases.
