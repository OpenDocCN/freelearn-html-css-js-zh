- en: The jQuery library is a JavaScript framework. It was released in 2006\. People
    used to call it **jSelect**. We use jQuery in our websites so that we can work
    with JavaScript easily and add effects to our web pages. You may think jQuery
    is different from JavaScript. No! jQuery is just another JavaScript file. It is
    a very lightweight library that helps you to decorate your web pages more easily
    with less coding.

- en: The jQuery library is super fun to use and easy for new learners. All you have
    to do is practice the methods and functions of jQuery. There are a lot of jQuery
    plugins online. You can also download and install them to your web page. Using
    jQuery and its plugins, you can beautifully decorate and code your site easily.
    The most interesting part of jQuery, for me, is animation. I will explain how
    to animate things using jQuery in the next chapter.
