			<p>To effectively utilize this book, you will need a Google account and should understand basic navigation through a web browser. While a standard <strong class="source-inline">@gmail.com</strong> account can use many of the features found within this book, to have access to all the features, a Google Workspace for Education account is needed. Furthermore, there are many tiers for this type of account. Therefore, knowing which tier your school division subscribes to will help you determine which features are available to you. </p>

			<p>While not required, familiarity with other Google apps such as Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, and Google Docs would be helpful. These apps, along with Google Classroom, are only accessible in a web browser. A reliable connection to the internet is required to explore any of the apps.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Whether you are using a digital or paper version of the book, we encourage you to follow along in Google Classroom. Creating a Class to test some of the features will avoid potential errors when facilitating similar activities with students.</strong></p>
			<p>Because Google Classroom has a teacher interface and a student interface, being part of a professional learning community or exploring this book with a colleague can help you when experimenting with features. A colleague can enroll in a practice class as a student so that you and your colleague can see both interfaces.</p>
