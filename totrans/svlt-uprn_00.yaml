- en: Hello, and welcome to *SvelteKit Up and Running*! This book aims to be an easy-to-read
    guide introducing you to the core concepts of the refreshingly simple **JavaScript**
    (**JS**) framework known as SvelteKit. It was written to highlight what I felt
    were the core concepts of the framework. Because the JS landscape changes so frequently,
    this text should not be considered an authority on SvelteKit. Rather, the intention
    behind this book is to provide a resource that I wish was available to me when
    I was learning this promising new framework. As I often find myself wanting to
    learn high-level concepts first and then move on to finer details, so this book
    will too. However, before we begin, we must cover a few high-level concepts.

- en: What is SvelteKit?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: SvelteKit is an all-in-one solution to develop web applications using Svelte
    components. If you’re familiar with React, then you’ve likely heard of **Create
    React App**. While both Svelte and React are useful to create reusable components
    built with JS, each is more useful when given a means of utilizing those components.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Out of the box, SvelteKit provides mechanisms to handle routing; **server-side
    rendering** (**SSR**) supports TypeScript and enriches the development experience
    with features such as **Hot Module Replacement** (**HMR**), which automatically
    refreshes the browser when changes are detected in an application. This feature,
    and many others, are made possible by the tight coupling of SvelteKit with Vite.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How does Vite simplify development?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: SvelteKit, and features such as HMR, wouldn’t be possible without Vite, which
    itself wouldn’t be possible without **Rollup** and **esbuild**. Vite differentiates
    itself from other bundling tools by providing a lightning-fast development server
    that leverages native **ECMAScript Module** (**ESM**) availability in modern web
    browsers. Vite accomplishes this by breaking application code into two parts –
    dependencies and source code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Dependencies
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Vite can provide a fast development server by pre-bundling each dependency from
    a project into its own ES module with esbuild. Whether those dependencies are
    in **CommonJS**, **Universal Module Definition** (**UMD**), or ESM formats is
    irrelevant to Vite, as it will convert them all to ESM on the initial application
    build. Doing this means the browser only has to make a single HTTP request for
    each dependency instead of a request for each import statement. This can greatly
    improve the performance of the development server, especially considering how
    quickly requests can add up in dependency-heavy applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Source code
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unlike dependencies, source code changes often during development. To keep the
    developers (you) of this source code happy, Vite utilizes a couple of clever approaches.
    Because modern browsers support native ES modules, Vite can offload the work of
    bundling to the browser and only needs to transform the source code into a native
    ES module before serving it to the browser. The appropriate source code is then
    only loaded by the browser when necessary – that is, if it is used on the currently
    displayed screen.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To avoid the inefficiency of re-bundling an entire application each time the
    source code changes, Vite supports HMR. Essentially, HMR is the practice of replacing
    only the ES module that was changed. This keeps the development server fast, whether
    the application consists of a single page or thousands.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So far, we’ve discussed Vite and its usage of esbuild, but how does **Rollup**
    fit in with it all? Vite utilizes Rollup during the build process – that is, instead
    of shipping the source code as is, our Svelte components are transformed into
    pure JS, which is then easily read by browsers. Rollup manages the potentially
    thousands of modules included in a project with features such as tree-shaking
    (only including parts of modules that are used), code splitting (breaking code
    up into chunks), and lazy loading (only loading resources when they are needed).
    The usage of these features leads to smaller, and therefore, better-performing
    web applications.
