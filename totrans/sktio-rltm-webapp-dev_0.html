Many people avoid going real-time under the assumption of the complexity involved. This book will show you how to build modern, real-time web applications powered by Socket.IO, introducing you to various features of Socket.IO and walking you through the development, hosting, and scaling of a chat server.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>To use this book, we don't presume any special requirements in software. You will need a PC with Linux or Windows OS or a Mac. You can use any text editor for coding, but having a programmer's editor such as Vi, Emacs, Notepad++, Sublime Text, or any IDE of your choice will help. We will be installing the remaining software, such as Node.js and npm, as we go through the book and when they are required.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is aimed at developers who want to start developing highly interactive and real-time web applications such as chat systems, online multiplayer games, or want to introduce real-time updates or server push mechanisms in their existing applications. Knowledge of developing in JavaScript and web applications in general is expected. Though there is a chapter on introducing Node.js, prior knowledge of Node.js will be a plus. Readers will need access to a computer system capable of running Node.js, a test or code editor, and access to the Internet to download the required software and components.</p></div>
