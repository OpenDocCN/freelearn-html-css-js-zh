    job. Fortunately, there are a plethora of tools available to support all facets
    of web application development. This chapter introduces a gamut of tools useful
    for web development, including editors, **Integrated Development Environments**
    (**IDEs**), web servers, web browsers, browser tools, and even HTTP proxies in
    the market.

    and they are often built to address the various needs of the end user. They can
    range from very simple text editors such as Notepad (Windows) and TextEdit (Mac)
    to sophisticated IDEs such as Eclipse. To make things even more interesting, there
    is a variety of new web-based editors and IDEs that allow you to develop from
    virtually any machine and collaborate with others on web projects with minimal
    setup.
