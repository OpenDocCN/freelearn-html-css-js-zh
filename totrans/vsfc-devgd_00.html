<em>Visualforce Developer's Guide</em> is a practical, hands-on pocket guide that provides a clear and simple guidance to develop Visualforce pages for the Force.com platform and for mobile applications. It also contains a single, continuous, real-world example with code samples. This book explains the Visualforce concepts and technical aspects in a simple manner.</p><p>
<em>Visualforce Developer's Guide</em> covers the main topics, starting with the development of Visualforce for the Force.com platform, and continuing on to developing Visualforce pages for Mobile applications quickly and painlessly.</p><p>The Force.com platform can automatically generate user interfaces (standard pages), but in some cases you might need to build a more customized UI. Visualforce allows developers to build sophisticated and customized user interfaces that can be hosted natively on the Force.com platform. Visualforce is a framework that includes a tag-based markup language similar to HTML.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
