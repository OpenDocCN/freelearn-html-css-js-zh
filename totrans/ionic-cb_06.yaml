    That means you should be able to register and authenticate users. Once the users
    start using the app, you also need to segment the users so that you can customize
    their interactions. Then, you can send push notifications to encourage users to
    revisit the app.

    that you delegate authentication of your application to Auth0\. Auth0 supports
    many frameworks, including Ionic2+, and also supports many social providers for
    authentication such as Google and Facebook. On the top of that, they have excellent
    documentation.'

    to both iOS and Android. As a matter of fact, it supports other platforms such
    as Windows, Web Push Notifications, Amazon Fire, and so on. The best part is,
    in general, we need different code for adding push notifications. But because
    of Cordova and OneSignal''s abstract API, we only need to write push notification
    code once for both platforms.'

    For example, it would make more sense to use a LinkedIn authentication for an
    app focusing on a working professional to narrow down the audiences who fit the
    user profile of the app.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Auth0 uses **JWT** (**JSON Web Token**), which is a compact way of sharing information
    between two parties via JSON. In simple terms, when the user is authenticated,
    Auth0 sends us JWTs, which have information about the user and also allow the
    user to access authenticated routes/URLs. Auth0 sends back an `access_token`,
    which is required for accessing authenticated routes, and it also sends us an
    `id_token`, which contains the user's profile information such as their username,
    profile picture, and so on. Both of these tokens have a short lifespan and then
    they expire. But along with that, Auth0 also sends us a `refresh_token`, which
    has a long expiry date and can be used to get a new `id_token` and `access_token`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We configured the Callback URL in our app. This is the URL where Auth0 redirects
    the user after authentication. A callback URL includes the app's package ID, and
    that's why we need to mention it while installing the plugin. We also need to
    add `file://` in **CORS** (**Cross-Origin Resource Sharing**), because the Ionic
    app makes an HTTP request from `file://` origin.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the `login` function, we initiate authentication by calling Auth0Cordova's
    `authorize` function. It is important to notice that we are passing an `option`
    object with `scope` key into an `authorize` function as the parameter. This scope
    key tells Auth0 to return certain data like an email and profile after authentication
    is completed. We are also passing a callback function as the second parameter,
    which fires when authentication is completed. When authentication is initiated,
    Auth0Cordova opens the OS browser and redirects us to our Auth0 Domain. Here,
    the user can log in and register. By default, email/password authentication is
    configured for the app. But you can enable Google, Facebook, and GitHub authentication,
    and they will also appear along with email/password authentication. When the user
    is authenticated, the browser redirects us to our app via the **Custom URL Scheme.**
    Then, we store `idToken` and `accessToken` in **localstorage** and also get profile
    information using the `auth0.client.userInfo` function. Then later in the login
    method, we also save this information to **localstorage**.

    when the user is authenticated, we show a profile picture and the username of
    the user, along with the LOGOUT button. These `login` and `logout` methods in
    `home.ts` call `AuthService`'s login and logout function respectively.

- en: A **push notification** is an important feature to engage users frequently,
    especially when the users are not using the app. Many people download an app,
    but only open it a few times. If you send them a push notification message, it
    will encourage them to open the app to get involved in a new activity. Implementing
    push notifications is very complex if you have to build everything from scratch;
    however, OneSignal makes it very simple. A push notification provider is a server
    that can communicate with the **Apple Push Notification service** (**APNs**),
    or Google's **Firebase Cloud Messaging** (**FCM**). You can set up your own provider
    server using existing open sources, but you have to maintain this server separately
    and keep up with potential changes from the APN APIs.

- en: The process is almost the same as iOS. The reason is, OneSignal abstracts lots
    of things for us. The difference is that, instead of sending push notification
    requests to APNS, it is now sending push notification requests to Google's FCM
    servers. Then, it forwards the push notification to the actual device.

    that for Android. Take a look at [https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/customize-notification-icons](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/customize-notification-icons).
