			<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>Hello world! <em class="italic">Node.js for Beginners</em> is a book designed with a specific goal in mind: to take you from zero to deployment as quickly as possible while building a real application that reinforces the lessons from <span class="No-Break">every chapter.</span></p>
			<p>Node.js has been a leading technology for many years, and while there are numerous resources available to learn from, this book takes a unique approach. The knowledge you gain here will remain relevant even if you decide to change parts of your tech stack. Let me illustrate this now with <span class="No-Break">an example.</span></p>
			<p>Throughout the book, we use MongoDB, a non-relational database, to build our project. You might wonder how to adapt the project if you prefer using PostgreSQL, for instance. The approach I’ve taken in writing this book will make such transitions smoother. You’ll have unit tests and a clear interface to manage these changes seamlessly. I wrote a dedicated chapter to introduce testing with the Node.js API and using third party libraries such as <em class="italic">Jest</em> or <em class="italic">supertest</em> and we integrate tests as a security net that allows us to refactor the code <span class="No-Break">without fear.</span></p>
			<p>I’ve written this book from the perspective of 2024, thinking about what I wish I had been taught when I was new <span class="No-Break">to Node.js.</span></p>
			<p>The book covers the wide range of challenges you’ll encounter while building a web application, from REST API design principles to security and proper application distribution with Docker, continuous integration, and <span class="No-Break">much more.</span></p>
			<p>It’s a consolidation of what I’ve been teaching my students and sharing with the community for the last decade. I hope you’ll find it as enjoyable to read as I found it <span class="No-Break">to write.</span></p>
			<p>Also, at the end of every chapter, you will find additional resources that will help you explore more deeply and learn the concepts that are most relevant <span class="No-Break">to you.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p><em class="italic">Node.js for Beginners</em> is a comprehensive introduction for those who are new to Node.js and/or web application development that will have you up to speed in no time. It will also help more experienced hands if you just want to refresh or extend <span class="No-Break">your knowledge.</span></p>
			<p>The three main personas who are the target audience of this content are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Any developer who is interested in learning Node.js quickly or wants to use Node.js to develop a web application</li>
				<li>Frontend developers who want to learn more about backend development or become full stack developers with Node.js</li>
				<li>Developers who already use Node.js on a daily basis and want to expand or refresh their knowledge in certain areas</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
