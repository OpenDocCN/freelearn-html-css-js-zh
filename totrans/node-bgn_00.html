			<p>Hello world! <em class="italic">Node.js for Beginners</em> is a book designed with a specific goal in mind: to take you from zero to deployment as quickly as possible while building a real application that reinforces the lessons from every chapter.</p>
			<p>Node.js has been a leading technology for many years, and while there are numerous resources available to learn from, this book takes a unique approach. The knowledge you gain here will remain relevant even if you decide to change parts of your tech stack. Let me illustrate this now with an example.</p>
			<p>Throughout the book, we use MongoDB, a non-relational database, to build our project. You might wonder how to adapt the project if you prefer using PostgreSQL, for instance. The approach I’ve taken in writing this book will make such transitions smoother. You’ll have unit tests and a clear interface to manage these changes seamlessly. I wrote a dedicated chapter to introduce testing with the Node.js API and using third party libraries such as <em class="italic">Jest</em> or <em class="italic">supertest</em> and we integrate tests as a security net that allows us to refactor the code without fear.</p>
			<p>I’ve written this book from the perspective of 2024, thinking about what I wish I had been taught when I was new to Node.js.</p>
			<p>The book covers the wide range of challenges you’ll encounter while building a web application, from REST API design principles to security and proper application distribution with Docker, continuous integration, and much more.</p>
			<p>It’s a consolidation of what I’ve been teaching my students and sharing with the community for the last decade. I hope you’ll find it as enjoyable to read as I found it to write.</p>
			<p>Also, at the end of every chapter, you will find additional resources that will help you explore more deeply and learn the concepts that are most relevant to you.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p><em class="italic">Node.js for Beginners</em> is a comprehensive introduction for those who are new to Node.js and/or web application development that will have you up to speed in no time. It will also help more experienced hands if you just want to refresh or extend your knowledge.</p>
			<p>The three main personas who are the target audience of this content are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Any developer who is interested in learning Node.js quickly or wants to use Node.js to develop a web application</li>
				<li>Frontend developers who want to learn more about backend development or become full stack developers with Node.js</li>
				<li>Developers who already use Node.js on a daily basis and want to expand or refresh their knowledge in certain areas</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>

You will learn how to build isomorphic code that can be executed in Node.js and in the browser and you will publish your first package to npm. We will also discuss npm alternatives such as Yarn or PnPM.</p>
			<p><a href="B21678_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor206"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a><em class="italic">, Event-Driven Architecture</em>, explores how the event-driven architecture is included in many core libraries such as <code>fs</code> and <code>http</code>. You will create applications that react to changes in files or receive HTTP requests, and will learn how to include an event API in your own modules as an API layer.</p>
			<p><a href="B21678_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor218"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a><em class="italic">, Testing in Node.js</em>, explores how testing is done in Node.js and all the possible approaches. We will use the Core testing library and Jest to build unit tests, and will use the coverage report to understand where to improve our testing strategy. Additionally, we will explore how the <strong class="bold">Test-Driven Development</strong> (<strong class="bold">TDD</strong>) approach in practical terms.</p>
			<p><a href="B21678_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor244"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a><em class="italic">, Handling HTTP and REST APIs</em>, teaches different strategies to build a web application (such as SPAs and server-side rendering) and how HTTP is structured in a way that allows us to build modern and solid APIs (with HTTP headers, status codes, payloads, and versions).
