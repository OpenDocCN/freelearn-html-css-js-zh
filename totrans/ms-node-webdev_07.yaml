    client-side application, and the browser. Earlier chapters have demonstrated how
    the Node.js API – and its add-on packages – can be used to receive and process
    HTTP requests. Now it is time to explore how the server-side part of the application
    has to work together with the other components.'

    fit together. The first topic is using a **bundler**. The client-side part of
    an application usually consists of a large number of files, and these are gathered
    together and compressed into a small number of files for efficiency. This is done
    by a bundler and most of the widely used client-side frameworks, such as Angular
    and React, provide developer tools that use a bundler named webpack. In the first
    part of the chapter, I explain how webpack works and describe the different ways
    that it can be integrated with the backend server. *Table 7.1* puts bundlers in
    context.

    add a file named `webpack.config.mjs` to the `webapp` folder with the content
    shown in *Listing 7.6*. webpack uses a JavaScript – rather than JSON – configuration
    file and the `mjs` file extension specifies a JavaScript module, which allows
    the use of the same `import` syntax used throughout this book.

    in the `static` folder and write the bundle it creates to a file named `bundle.js`
    in the `dist/client` folder. There isn’t enough client-side JavaScript in the
    example project to give webpack much to do, but in a real project, webpack will
    follow all the imports made in the starting JavaScript file and incorporate all
    of the code the application requires into the bundle. *Listing 7.7* updates the
    `index.html` file so that it uses the `bundle.js` file that webpack will create.

    The webpack server listens for HTTP requests on the port specified by the `port`
    setting and responds using the files in the directories specified by the `static`
    setting. The key difference is that the bundle of JavaScript sent to the browser
    contains additional code that opens a persistent HTTP connection back to the development
    server and waits for a signal. When webpack detects that one of the files it is
    watching has changed, it builds a new bundle and sends the browser the signal
    that it has been waiting for, which loads the changed content dynamically. This
    is known as *live reloading*.

    part of the application. Browsers allow JavaScript code to make HTTP requests
    only within the same *origin*, which means URLs that have the same scheme, host,
    and port as the URL used to load the JavaScript code. The change in *Listing 7.15*
    means that the HTTP request is to a URL that is outside of the allowed origin
    and so the browser blocks the request. The solution to this problem is to use
    **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing** (**CORS**), in which the browser sends an additional
    request to the target HTTP server to determine whether it is willing to accept
    HTTP requests from the origin of the JavaScript code.

    to see the requests the browser has made. You will see a request that uses the
    HTTP `OPTIONS` method, which is known as the *pre-flight request*, as shown in
    *Figure 7.5*, and which allows the backend server to indicate whether it will
    accept the request.

    HTML or JavaScript content when the product page is displayed.

    `http://*.acme.com`) or a scheme (such as `http:` to allow all HTTP requests or
    `https:` for all HTTPS requests). There are also special values such as `'none'`,
    which blocks all URLs, and `'self'`, which limits requests to the origin from
    which the document was loaded. (The single quotes must be specified for these
    special values, which is why the policy defined in *Listing 7.33* looks oddly
    quoted.)

    One excellent package is *Helmet* ([https://helmetjs.github.io](https://helmetjs.github.io)),

    command shown in *Listing 7.34* in the `webapp` folder to install the Helmet package.

    determine the headers that are set and the values that should be used. The `contentSecurityPolicy.directives`
    property is used to set CSP directives, expressed as camel case because the hyphenated
    CSP directive names are not allowed in JavaScript (so `img-src` becomes `imgSrc`,
    for example).

    a web sockets connection and is the same connection that required additional configuration
    when setting up the proxy in *Listing 7.21*).

    in the browser’s JavaScript console. That’s because the CSP has disabled the use
    of the `eval` function, which is sensible because it is so dangerous, but problematic
    because webpack unpacks the contents of its bundles using `eval`. (This is only
    the case when webpack is producing development bundles and is not the case when
    the final bundles are produced before an application is deployed.)

    `webapp` folder to start them again with the new configuration. Reload the browser
    and the JavaScript bundle will be processed without using the `eval` function.
    Run through the examples in *Listing 7.28* to *Listing 7.32* again and you will
    see that each attack is defeated by one of the content security settings.

    on actions that would break the content security policy without blocking those
    actions, which can be a good way to assess an existing application. If you are
    using the Helmet package, you can enable this header by setting the `contentSecurityPolicy.reportOnly`
    configuration setting to `true`.

    `eval` function in the content security policy. Use `"'self' 'unsafe-eval'"` as
    the value for the `scriptSrc` setting. The special `'unsafe-eval'` value allows
    the eval function to be used, but the `'self'` value restricts the locations from
    which JavaScript files can be downloaded to just the backend server.
