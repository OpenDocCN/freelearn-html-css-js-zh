- en: Sometimes, inking requires us to answer a set of questions relating to how to
    render something. How can we make a textured, grungy look? How can we use the
    digital space to make repetitive inking tasks easier and more efficient? Becoming
    familiar with the other drawing tools and how to customize them is the best way
    to save time when drawing. When you have a core understanding of how to create
    and customize tools, you can make special ones that solve problems and speed up
    your workflow.

- en: Digital art materials are a contentious topic, as over-relying on them is sometimes
    seen as cheating. The important thing to remember is that the materials used for
    custom brushes still need to be drawn; you still need to know how to draw the
    materials, it just saves the repetition of drawing hundreds of leaves or blades
    of grass. Making custom tools that can create a grungy effect, make lightning,
    or even create a crowd scene for us is no more cheating than using a ruler or
    a compass on a piece of paper.

    palette. Perhaps it’s the title logo for your comic series and you want to be
    able to easily add it to your covers. Maybe it’s a watermark that you intend to
    put over any image that you post online to deter art theft. Maybe it’s a special
    speech balloon you designed for the villain of your manga, or it’s a special repeating
    plaid pattern for your protagonist’s outfit. You can also lay out complex tattoos
    and save them to the **Material** palette so that you can use them again instead
    of drawing them over and over every time you draw the character. Alternatively,
    you can create a T-shirt design for a character and simply paste it in and edit
    it slightly to fit the angle your character is standing at instead of redrawing
    the design each time!

    direction we move the stylus in to make our line, allowing us to overlap the hatching
    to get cross-hatching lines.

    that we can set the color of the brush as needed. This can be seen in the preceding
    figure with the white highlight cross-hatching on the left side of the face, the
    hair, the shoulder, and the tip of the newspaper.

    for making our own custom tools, and with this knowledge, you should be able to
    make pretty much any special brush that you can dream up! We learned how to make
    and save our own custom materials that can be used as brush tips. We created a
    grittily textured inking brush and learned how to set the **Sub Tool Detail**
    settings to get the look we wanted. We made a glass shard brush that utilized
    **Opacity** and a **Random** direction to give us the appearance of hundreds of
    hand-inked glass shards in an illustration. Then, we used the **Ribbon** options
    to create a foliage brush. Finally, we used the parallel line ruler to create
    a brush tip material and used the **Direction of line** brush option to create
    a layered cross-hatching brush.

    will have a closer look at how vector layers are different from raster layers,
    which have a few different capabilities that might be useful for you.
