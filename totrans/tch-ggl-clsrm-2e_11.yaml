    teacher and students. However, parents and guardians are important stakeholders
    in this communication too. Google Classroom can send email summaries to parents
    invited as guardians within Google Classroom. This method must be enabled by the
    school or district's IT department. If your school or district uses another method
    of communication with parents, they may leave this feature disabled because of
    its inherent security risks. (For example, my current school employer disabled
    Google Classroom's guardian emails so that emails can undergo a verification process
    within an in-house system.)

    are still able to inform guardians about important due dates from Google Classroom.
    Back in [*Chapter 1*](B16846_01_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013), *Getting
    to Know Google Classroom*, I mentioned that each class created in Google Classroom
    has a Google Calendar created for the question and assignment due dates. This
    chapter will explore how to use guardian emails within Google Classroom and the
    class's Google Calendar to communicate with parents and guardians.

    information to parents. Therefore, you may have to adapt the information you find
    in this chapter to best suit your school district's online resources. For example,
    in my school district, administrators, teachers, parents, and students are all
    included in an intranet designed for communication between stakeholders.

    the school website. Therefore, this chapter will explore using the guardian emails
    feature and two different methods of keeping parents in the loop with Google Calendar:
    using Google Calendar website and using Google Sites to create a class-specific
    website.'

    Once they sign up, parents will continue to receive summary emails. Furthermore,
    they only need to sign up once. Therefore, if parents sign up for guardian emails
    in their child's early school years, they will continue to receive summary emails
    throughout their child's school experience.

    can add additional content from the sidebar. Experiment with adding section headers,
    text, images, Google Docs, YouTube videos, and more! Many teachers use a Google
    Site to store content that they use year on year in addition to their Google Classrooms.

    be able to view the question and assignment posts within your classes. While implementing
    either of these features may seem time-consuming to set up, it occurs at the beginning
    of the year or semester and requires little maintenance throughout the year. Now
    that you are able to invite parents or guardians to receive email notifications,
    you can share Google Classroom calendars with parents through a URL or a Google
    Site.

    manage and grade their assignments, it unifies much of the administration and
    management aspects of the classroom so that you can focus on teaching.
