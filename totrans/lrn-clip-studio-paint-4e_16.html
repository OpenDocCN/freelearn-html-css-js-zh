</ul>
<p class="normal">We are going to look at how to use reference layers and start exploring ways to add colors without having mishaps such as overflooding areas you want to color. Then, we will learn how to change the colors in line art for an organic organic-looking finish. Next, we will learn what layer blending modes are and the benefits of using them, with rich visual references. Then, we will explore the time-saver function, Shading Assist. We will move on to learn how to use color mixing for a realistic way of creating a desired color. Finally, we will look into Color Match options, filters, and the Liquify tool to change the final look of the artwork. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to handle digital coloring easily and effectively, which means you can expand your range of color expressions.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s jump into the wonderful world of color!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-285">Technical requirements</h1>
<p class="normal">To get started, you need Clip Studio Paint already installed on your device, and a new canvas opened with any line art layer and a white-colored paper layer. Any size is fine, but I recommend creating a 300 DPI square canvas to go through the content in this chapter.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-286">Using reference layers</h1>
<p class="normal">In this section, we<a id="_idIndexMarker1204"/> are going to look at a basic way, and one of the<a id="_idIndexMarker1205"/> most useful, to start coloring. Having line art already on your canvas and knowing the great digital coloring benefits really changes your creative life.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s have a look at reference layers. <strong class="screenText">Reference layers</strong> are a game changer for anyone who does digital art. Reference layers allow us to make some aspects of the digital coloring process a lot easier. Many digital art beginners make a mistake when they start adding color to their art. Once they have some nice inks down, they grab the Fill tool in whatever software they’re using and start adding color willy-nilly to the same layer that their line art is on. This produces results similar to what’s shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16.1</em>.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_16_16.1.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.1: Image colored by the fill tool</p>
<p class="normal">If we look closely at the area between the black lines and the color, we can see a slight line of white<a id="_idIndexMarker1206"/> and gray pixels that haven’t been filled in. This <a id="_idIndexMarker1207"/>results in an unpolished look, and taking a pen tool and going over the unfilled area takes a lot of time to clean it up.</p>
<p class="normal">Each artist is unique and has their own way of working, but it is recommended that you utilize your layers to their full advantage and also to make your process easier. Line art should be on one layer, and coloring should be on another. This is very easy to do if you create your inked lines digitally because, on the layer, you should have just ink lines and the rest of the space is transparent. If you have ink lines from a scanned image, the whole layer is opaque, which means you can’t separate layers of ink lines and background color. All you then need to do is create a new layer below the ink layer and then put your colors on that layer, as shown in the layer setup in <em class="italic">Figure 16.2</em>.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_16_16.2.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.2: Layer palette</p>
<p class="normal">Another thing that some digital art beginners do is create their color layer below their lines, then take the pen tool and draw around the outline of each area on the new<a id="_idIndexMarker1208"/> layer so it can be filled in on the color layer. This also<a id="_idIndexMarker1209"/> takes a lot of time and effort and can be done much more easily and effectively using the tools and features built into Clip Studio Paint.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">If you draw ink lines on paper and scan them into your computer, you can still digitally color your lines. You will want to set your layer with your scanned lines with the <strong class="screenText">Multiply</strong> layer mode. This will make your white areas transparent when color is applied to layers underneath, while the black areas will not show color through them.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Before we get into filling in actual colors, let’s talk for a moment about reference layers.</p>
<p class="normal">Reference layers are layers that have an effect on how tools act on other layers. This setting is turned on and off by clicking on the lighthouse icon at the top of the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette. In <em class="italic">Figure 16.3,</em> this icon is highlighted with a red circle.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_16_16.3.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.3: Reference layer icon on the Layer palette</p>
<p class="normal"><em class="italic">Figure 16.3</em> <a id="_idIndexMarker1210"/>shows that the <strong class="screenText">ink</strong> layer has been turned into a reference layer. Now, even if we go to the <strong class="screenText">Flat color</strong> layer below it, any tools that we set to work will be changed by the contents of the reference layer.</p>
<p class="normal">As an example, let’s see what happens when we use a pen tool with the reference layer options. In order to do this, we’ll open the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool Detail</strong> window with <strong class="screenText">G-pen</strong> selected. We learned how to do this in <em class="italic">Chapter 9</em>, <em class="italic">Material Palette and Inking Special Effects</em>. Then, follow these steps to use the anti-overflow options with the pen tool:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Click on the <strong class="screenText">Anti-overflow</strong> option in the menu of the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool Detail</strong> palette.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Check the box next to <strong class="screenText">Do not cross lines of reference layer</strong>.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Use the pen on a layer other than the layer set as the reference layer. The pen will only fill inside of the lines where it is clicked. Using the thicker pen, it would be easier to see the effect.</li>
<li class="numberedList">If there is still a white outline around the color area, click on the box next to the <strong class="screenText">Area scaling</strong> option. This option will automatically expand the colored area so that the color goes underneath the line art slightly, eliminating the white pixels.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">In <em class="italic">Figure 16.4</em>, we can see the <strong class="screenText">Do not cross lines of reference laye</strong>r option settings for <strong class="screenText">Anti-over flow</strong> on the left (pointed to by the arrow), and the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette on the right, and we can see that we are coloring on the <strong class="screenText">Flat color</strong> layer. Even though the line <a id="_idIndexMarker1211"/>art<a id="_idIndexMarker1212"/> is on a completely different layer, we can bind the colors to the line art boundaries using this simple combination of settings.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_16_16.4.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.4: Sub Tool Detail and Layer palettes</p>
<p class="normal">Now, you know the good way to start coloring with the reference layer and <strong class="screenText">Anti-overflow</strong> setting on<a id="_idIndexMarker1213"/> pen tools. Let’s explore two ways of making color flats in the next two sections.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-287">Creating flats using the fill and pen tools</h1>
<p class="normal">In this section, we <a id="_idIndexMarker1214"/>will use the fill tool, which<a id="_idIndexMarker1215"/> uses the reference layer as its<a id="_idIndexMarker1216"/> boundary. <em class="italic">Flats</em> is a shortened word for <em class="italic">flat-colored layers</em>; the layer has colors painted without shading or lighting, hence it is flat and two-dimensional looking. Normally, artists create these flats after creating line art layers, which means just painting foundation colors according to the inked line art, then adding patterns, shading, lighting, and special effects later.</p>
<p class="normal">To complete this section, we will need a file open that has a set of lines on a layer we have set as a reference layer. Only one layer can be set as the reference layer at a time, but we can use tools that conform to the reference layer on any other layer in the file.</p>
<p class="normal">Complete the following steps to create a custom Fill tool that conforms to the reference layer:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Select the <strong class="screenText">Fill</strong> (paint bucket) tool.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Select the <strong class="screenText">Refer other layers</strong> sub tool.</li>
<li class="numberedList">In the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette, find the <strong class="screenText">Refer multiple</strong> option. Select the <strong class="screenText">reference layer</strong> icon for this option as in <em class="italic">Figure 16.5</em>.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Ensure that the <strong class="screenText">Area scaling</strong> box is checked.</li>
<li class="numberedList">This will automatically expand the boundaries of the color underneath the line art, ensuring a smooth transition from line art to color without any stray white pixels. You may have to adjust this setting for optimal results, depending on how thick or thin your line art is. Use the eraser tool to clean up any overflow that goes into areas<a id="_idIndexMarker1217"/> where it’s not desired.</li>
<li class="numberedList">If there are small gaps in your ink lines, check the box next to the <strong class="screenText">Close gap</strong> option. This will automatically close small gaps and prevent colors from flowing over into other areas. Depending on how large or small the gaps are in your reference layer’s lines, you may have to adjust the slider for optimal results. The settings are shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16.5.</em></li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_16_16.5.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.5: screenshot of Refer multiple setting</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="7">Using the <strong class="screenText">Fill</strong> tool, click <a id="_idIndexMarker1218"/>on the areas of the<a id="_idIndexMarker1219"/> drawing to apply the required colors for that drawing. In <em class="italic">Figure 16.6</em>, the colors for the hair, skin, eyes, and clothes have been added to the character, but there are still some small white spots that the Fill tool missed because the areas are too small.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_16_16.6.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.6: Image colored with the Fill tool</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="8">Use the <a id="_idIndexMarker1220"/>pen or<a id="_idIndexMarker1221"/> brush<a id="_idIndexMarker1222"/> tool to fill in any other stray areas or add details, such as hair decoration or any other areas that need special attention.<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Many digital art beginners ask how many layers they should use when creating their pieces. As with almost anything in art, this is really up to the artist. While you can put everything on one layer, it is recommended to separate line art and color layers so that colors can be changed without having to change the line art, and coloring and special effects are made easier. Some artists put all their flat colors on one layer, then have one layer for shadows and another for highlights. Some artists have a separate layer for each and every color used in their pieces. It depends on how you want to work as an artist, and sometimes it is up to the specs of your computer! A computer with less RAM and hard drive space won’t be able to handle a file with lots of layers, so keep this in mind.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">Now that the flats are done using the Fill and pen tools, we can use the auto-select (magic wand) tool to select the flat colors from the <strong class="screenText">flats</strong> layer and then add shadows and highlights on another layer using the brush of your choice. Shading is the word we use for adding darker colors to our art to create shadow, and then the art will look three-dimensional, be able to tell the time of the day, and depict a mood. Highlights are for adding a lighter color to create shiny effects on glistening eyes, hair, mechanics, tools, weapons, stars, and wet objects. Both processes are so much fun and creative.</p>
<p class="normal">There is also a way <a id="_idIndexMarker1223"/>that <a id="_idIndexMarker1224"/>you <a id="_idIndexMarker1225"/>can add colors and gradients to your black line art, which comes in handy when you want to create art with line drawings appearing to naturally blend in harmony with colored areas. Read on to find out how to do it.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-288">Creating colored line art</h1>
<p class="normal">It’s OK when you draw <a id="_idIndexMarker1226"/>black-and-white art with a solid black line, but<a id="_idIndexMarker1227"/> once you start coloring the image, don’t you think the black line color can be too harsh on the eyes? We are going to explore how to change the line art color in this section.</p>
<p class="normal">Colored line work, or color holds, can be used for a variety of effects. It can highlight an area, make it blend more with the coloring, or make a background element face away to leave the foreground in the spotlight. Colored line art can make an image look much softer by not having harsh black lines in it. This is a very easy technique to use to really add punch to an illustration.</p>
<p class="normal">To follow the steps in this section, you will need line art done on a transparent layer, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16.7</em>.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_16_16.7.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.7: Line drawing</p>
<p class="normal">The preceding image is an ink drawing scanned from paper, with the white taken out automatically using Clip Studio Paint. You can do this with a scanned image by opening it<a id="_idIndexMarker1228"/> in Clip<a id="_idIndexMarker1229"/> Studio Paint. If needed, adjust the brightness and contrast to make the ink lines stand out sharply from the paper color. This will also make the conversion much cleaner. Once this is done, in the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu, click on <strong class="screenText">Edit</strong> and then <strong class="screenText">Convert brightness to opacity</strong>. Clip Studio Paint will make the brightest areas transparent and the darkest areas opaque.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s add colors to a line drawing with the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">On the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette, click on the layer with the inked lines to select it.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on the <strong class="screenText">lock transparent pixels</strong> icon, located above the list of layers. This icon is circled in <em class="italic">Figure 16.8</em>.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_16_16.8.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.8: Lock transparent pixels icon</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="3">Select your preferred pen or brush tool.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Select the color that you wish to change your line art to.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Use the pen or brush over the inked lines to change the color from black to the current color.</li>
<li class="numberedList">To change all the lines at the same time, select the color to change the line art to and then click on the <strong class="screenText">Fill</strong> icon in the command bar at the top of the Clip Studio Paint interface. This will flood all the lines at the same time.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">When we lock <a id="_idIndexMarker1230"/>the <a id="_idIndexMarker1231"/>transparent pixels of the drawing, we prevent Clip Studio from altering the pixels that are not transparent in that layer. In this case, all ink lines are opaque, so we can only change their colors. In <em class="italic">Figure 16.9</em>, the pink scribble across the line art was made wildly, but it only shows on the filled-in lines.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_16_16.9.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.9: Altered line color</p>
<p class="normal">This technique allows <a id="_idIndexMarker1232"/>us to use pens, brushes, or even gradient tools<a id="_idIndexMarker1233"/> to color our lines. This is good fun to use when you have a new design for merchandise from your manga pages. The drawing in <em class="italic">Figure 16.10 </em>had a <strong class="screenText">Rainbow</strong> gradient applied to the line layer.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_16_16.10.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.10: Rainbow line color</p>
<p class="normal">Color holds can also be more subtle and make line work less “in your face,” like in the interior of the hair and on the face and lips in <em class="italic">Figure 16.11</em>.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_16_16.11.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.11: Image with a changed line color</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s see<a id="_idIndexMarker1234"/> another <a id="_idIndexMarker1235"/>example of changing the color of line works on an umbrella in <em class="italic">Figure 16.12</em>.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_16_16.12.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.12: Image with a changed line color 2</p>
<p class="normal">You can use airbrush tools to change the line colors of the ribs of the umbrella to express shade.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Certainly, you can apply the same method on a flat color layer to change the color instantly to your desired one! But to do so, you need to have each color area as an individual layer. It all depends on your device’s RAM allowance. As a guideline, 8 GB is fine, and 16 GB is very usable. With 32 GB, it will be safe to work on 30 or more layers in one image and even have multiple pages open at the same time.</p>
<p class="normal">If you can, it’s always useful, and even easy, to have a flat skin color, hair color, and clothing color in a different layer, then use layer masks or clipping layers to work on each section. For more on layer masks or clipping layers, go to <em class="italic">Chapter 12</em>, <em class="italic">Making Layer Masks and Screentones</em>. Now, you have total color control of not only filling areas and shading or light effects but also line art!</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">When you finish your flat coloring on your art, how about giving more three-dimensional <a id="_idIndexMarker1236"/>effects<a id="_idIndexMarker1237"/> by adding shading and highlights? Layer blending modes are very useful functions for adding shadows and highlights, which we will explore in the next section.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-289">Exploring layer blending modes</h1>
<p class="normal">Layer blending<a id="_idIndexMarker1238"/> modes are functions for colored layers to <a id="_idIndexMarker1239"/>change how to blend the colors with other layers. You can make colors darker by mixing them with other layers, or lighter, or invert the hue. When you want to add shade, light, light reflections, and color enhancements to your flat color art, layer blending modes will come in handy, because you can add these effects without hiding or ruining the flat color art! We are going to have a look at what layer blending modes are and how you can use them with examples.</p>
<p class="normal">At the top of the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette is a drop-down menu that controls our layer blending mode. <em class="italic">Figure 16.13</em> shows the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette and some of the blending modes available for us to use in our art.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_16_16.13.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.13: Layer blending mode drop-down menu</p>
<p class="normal">There are tons of <a id="_idIndexMarker1240"/>layer blending modes, and each one can give us a different effect. However, in this section, we are going to<a id="_idIndexMarker1241"/> concentrate on the <strong class="screenText">Multiply</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Soft light, </strong>and<strong class="screenText"> Screen</strong> layer blending modes. These are the three modes most used in coloring, though, of course, you may find that other modes fit your style better. Let’s look at each of the three modes that we listed and see how we can use them to color our images.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-290">The Multiply mode</h2>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Multiply</strong> mode is<a id="_idIndexMarker1242"/> used most often by digital<a id="_idIndexMarker1243"/> artists. This is because it makes white areas of the layer “transparent” but keeps the black areas opaque. This makes it the ideal selection for something like a scanned ink image. By setting the scanned image to <strong class="screenText">Multiply</strong>, digital colors can be applied beneath the line art to finish the illustration. <strong class="screenText">Multiply</strong> also makes colors darker by combining them with the colors below them. This makes the <strong class="screenText">Multiply</strong> mode ideal for shadow layers.</p>
<p class="normal">Shading, as we discussed in the <em class="italic">Creating flats using the fill and pen tools</em> section earlier, is a wonderful skill to have. Compared with observation drawings, manga drawings often have very limited shading, but at the same time, it’s very tactical. One obvious place to add a shade is un derneath the face, which instantly lifts the face color and makes it stand out; plus, we can tell the audience that the character’s head is a three-dimensional object. Other shading places will be under eyelids, nose, body, and some parts obviously beneath bigger objects. In <em class="italic">Figure 16.14</em>, from the left, you can see a flat-colored artwork, a shading part, and a shaded artwork.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_16_16.14.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.14: Three images with and without shading</p>
<p class="normal">The image in the middle shows where exactly the shading is: under the fringe, head, arms, and<a id="_idIndexMarker1244"/> her left leg. They are limited but <a id="_idIndexMarker1245"/>effective. We turn this layer of a shading area into the <strong class="screenText">Multiply</strong> blending layer mode, and it should be placed on top of the flat-colored layers. In the result, which is the image on the right in <em class="italic">Figure 16.14</em>, we can see the character drawing has more depth in both colors and dimensions.</p>
<p class="normal">Light purple is a very popular color to shade with. In <em class="italic">Figure 16.15</em>, the purple layer is set to the <strong class="screenText">Normal</strong> blending mode and no mixing is going on with the flat colors beneath.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_16_16.15.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.15: Image with shadows in light purple</p>
<p class="normal">Now, we are going<a id="_idIndexMarker1246"/> to make the light purple color interact<a id="_idIndexMarker1247"/> with the flat colors below on the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette and mix them, making new colors and shades by changing the layer blending modes to <strong class="screenText">Multiply</strong>. <em class="italic">Figure 16.16</em> is the artwork with the <strong class="screenText">Multiply</strong> blending mode layer added with the light purple color.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_16_16.16.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.16: Image with Multiply shading</p>
<p class="normal">We can control the contrast between the base color and shadows by adjusting the <strong class="screenText">opacity</strong> of the <strong class="screenText">Multiply</strong> mode shadow layer. This is done using the slider to the right of the <strong class="screenText">Blending mode</strong> drop-down menu. The preceding screenshot has had the shading layer lowered to <strong class="screenText">90 </strong>%, making the shadows much less intense.</p>
<p class="normal">Building up multiple layers of shadows can provide greater contrast and deeper shadows. I normally use three different <strong class="screenText">Multiply</strong> layers for shadows: one for a big mass of shadow to mark the light direction, such as a sunset, a candlelight, or a light coming through between the leaves of the tree shade. Another is for all the object or a character body only using a deep orange <strong class="screenText">Gradient</strong> tool to create a deeper shadow, which is darker at the bottom, mainly for distinguishing it from the background. The <a id="_idIndexMarker1248"/>last one is for spot shading, such as <a id="_idIndexMarker1249"/>in <em class="italic">Figure 16.16</em>.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s look at adding colors or light effects in a subtle way with the <strong class="screenText">Soft light</strong> layer blending mode.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-291">The Soft light mode</h2>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Soft light</strong> mode is the <a id="_idIndexMarker1250"/>best mode when you <a id="_idIndexMarker1251"/>want to add colors very softly, such as creating rosy cheeks, or the gradient of hair color. First of all, you can select the area you want to add the color to with the <strong class="screenText">auto-select</strong> magic wand tool and click on the colored area you want to select.</p>
<p class="normal">Then, you can only add colors inside the selection boundary without the new color overlapping the old colors. The image in <em class="italic">Figure 16.17</em> shows the addition of the color pink using the <strong class="screenText">Soft</strong> airbrush tool with the <strong class="screenText">Soft light</strong> blending mode only on the cheeks, nose, and fingers on selected skin color areas.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_16_16.17.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.17: Soft light mode used on cheeks</p>
<p class="normal">The effect is so gentle that you can have great control of how dense the color you want to add by controlling how much color you will put using the <strong class="screenText">Soft airbrush </strong>tool. We can always change the <strong class="screenText">opacity</strong> of the layer if we need an even softer effect. <strong class="screenText">Soft light</strong> mode is also used to mark the light zones with the light color as well as the shadow zones with a cold tone. Besides the cheeks, it works very well to add<a id="_idIndexMarker1252"/> red tones on the articulations (ears, elbows, knees, etc.) due <a id="_idIndexMarker1253"/>to the blood flow. Read on to find out how to add a lighting effect with the <strong class="screenText">Screen</strong> layer blending mode.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-292">The Screen mode</h2>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Screen</strong> mode is useful <a id="_idIndexMarker1254"/>for creating vivid<a id="_idIndexMarker1255"/> highlights. You can even use colors that you might not think of using for highlights to create a certain mood in your illustration or comic scene. In <em class="italic">Figure 16.18</em>, the highlight layer is set to <strong class="screenText">Normal</strong> to show that we are using a turquoise color on this layer.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_16_16.18.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.18: Image with highlights</p>
<p class="normal">By using our drop-down menu on the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette, we can set our highlight layer to <strong class="screenText">Screen</strong> mode. Using<a id="_idIndexMarker1256"/> this blending mode, we <a id="_idIndexMarker1257"/>now get the highlights shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16.19</em>.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_16_16.19.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.19: Image with highlights in the Screen mode</p>
<p class="normal">Now, instead of the highlights on the face being turquoise, they are a light color close to white, while the highlights on the clothes still retain the turquoise hue. This mode gives us an effect that’s just the opposite of what the <strong class="screenText">Multiply</strong> mode does – the <strong class="screenText">Screen</strong> mode makes color on layers underneath lighter, while <strong class="screenText">Multiply</strong> mode makes them darker.</p>
<p class="normal">We have learned how to add shade with the <strong class="screenText">Multiply</strong> mode, rosy cheeks with the <strong class="screenText">Soft light</strong> mode, and finally, a light effect with the <strong class="screenText">Screen</strong> mode. These are just three of the many blending modes available to us. By combining layer modes and opacity in different ways, we can create many different effects. Experimentation is the key here because each artist is different and likes to create a specific look with their art. Changing the layer mode does no damage to the original layer, so play with the layer modes in your art to see what different looks you can create <a id="_idIndexMarker1258"/>using them and different colors to<a id="_idIndexMarker1259"/> create shadows and highlights in your art.</p>
<p class="normal">With layer blending modes in mind, there is a great time-saving function – Shading Assist.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-293">Shading with Shading Assist</h1>
<p class="normal">It’s totally fine to add <a id="_idIndexMarker1260"/>shade by yourself, but sometimes it’s <a id="_idIndexMarker1261"/>useful to use a special function that is made for generating shade on your picture, especially when you need to draw tons of characters in a limited timescale. Of course, using <strong class="screenText">Shading Assist</strong> only assists us by suggesting some different ways of shading and applying specific shading to different artworks, but it’s not replaceable for our own unique shading: expressing the environment and mood of art perfectly. It is still an interesting and useful tool, however.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s try using it and see how our art will be shaded! Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.27:Shading Assist dialog for Cel shading</p>
<p class="normal">Does it seem a lot <a id="_idIndexMarker1272"/>to learn? It’s actually quite simple! The following breakdown will give you good ideas of what they are:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Shadow type</strong>: This gives you two types of shading – <strong class="screenText">Smooth shading</strong>, which creates a smooth blended transition between shaded and non-shaded areas, and <strong class="screenText">Cel shading</strong>, which creates a distinct border between shaded and non-shaded areas; it can generate up to four shadows and highlights.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Shading bar</strong>: When <strong class="screenText">Cel shading</strong> is selected in <strong class="screenText">Shadow type</strong>, the shading bar is displayed, and you can drag the arrow right or left to adjust the shade range.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Reverse shadows</strong>: When it’s on, shadows and highlights applied to the canvas are inverted.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Level 1 Color</strong>: This sets the color of the shade.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Blending mode</strong>: This sets the blending mode of the generated layer.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">When <strong class="screenText">Shadow</strong><strong class="screenText"><a id="_idIndexMarker1273"/></strong><strong class="screenText"> type</strong> is set to <strong class="screenText">Smooth shading</strong>, you will see different settings, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16.28</em>.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_16_16.28.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.28: Shading Assist dialog for Smooth shading</p>
<p class="normal">There are a great<a id="_idIndexMarker1274"/> number of bars, and the breakdown of <a id="_idIndexMarker1275"/>each setting is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Invert shadows and highlights</strong>: When it’s on, it swaps shadow areas and highlight areas in the image.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Highlights Color</strong>: You can select either <strong class="screenText">Use layer color</strong> or <strong class="screenText">Use base color</strong>. When <strong class="screenText">Use layer color</strong> is selected, the selected layer is used for the base color, and the highlights and shadows are generated according to it. When <strong class="screenText">Use base color</strong> is selected, you can pick a new color for the base color and can set <strong class="screenText">Blending mode</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Strength</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Blur level</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Shadow balance</strong>.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Hue</strong>: This specifies the amount of hue change relative to the base color, which makes highlights brighter and shadows darker.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Saturation</strong>: This specifies the amount of change in saturation relative to the base color, which makes highlights brighter and shadows darker.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Strength</strong>: This determines the intensity of highlights and shadows.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Blur</strong>: The larger the value, the smoother the highlights and shadows are blended.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Shadow balance</strong>: This sets the percentage of shading relative to the total shadows generated. The closer to 100, the larger the shaded area.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Now, you are a <a id="_idIndexMarker1276"/>master of the <strong class="screenText">Shading</strong> settings! Let’s move on to <strong class="screenText">Light</strong> <strong class="screenText">source</strong> settings, which you can see in <em class="italic">Figure 16.29.</em></p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_16_16.29.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.29: Light source settings </p>
<p class="normal">Compared with the <strong class="screenText">Shading </strong>settings, the <strong class="screenText">Light source </strong>settings are much more compact. Let’s have a close look at them:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Light source type: </strong>Gives <a id="_idIndexMarker1277"/>two different types of light source. The <strong class="screenText">Ball light</strong> type places a light source that can be moved to anywhere on the canvas. </li>
</ul>
<p class="normal-one">The Directional light type applies light to the entire canvas at the same angle and intensity to generate shading with the angle of your choice.</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Light position (X) </strong>and <strong class="screenText">(Y):</strong> Enabled when the light source type is set to <strong class="screenText">Ball light</strong>. These set where the light source is placed on the canvas in regards to width and height. You can set any value from -100 to 100; when both <strong class="screenText">X</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Y</strong> are set to <strong class="screenText">50</strong>, the <strong class="screenText">Ball light</strong> position comes in the middle of the canvas. If we want a light directly above, try <strong class="screenText">X</strong> for <strong class="screenText">50</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Y</strong> as <strong class="screenText">0</strong>, or directly underneath, try <strong class="screenText">X</strong> as <strong class="screenText">50</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Y</strong> as <strong class="screenText">100</strong>. When the light source type is set to <strong class="screenText">Directional light</strong>, you can set a value of the <strong class="screenText">Light angle</strong>.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Refer to lines on reference layer</strong>: When it’s on, this refers to lines on the reference layer to generate shading. When off, shading is generated using only the information on the color layer.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Strength</strong>: Enabled <a id="_idIndexMarker1278"/>when <strong class="screenText">Refer to lines on reference layer</strong> is turned on. This sets the strength at which the line art influences the shading. The higher the value, the more likely it is to generate shading along the lines of the line art.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Great, you can now have control of the <strong class="screenText">Shading Assist</strong> settings! I’m sure you want to save the settings you have just adjusted to the <strong class="screenText">Preset</strong> shading. Follow the steps to learn how to save and delete it:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Click the <strong class="screenText">create preset</strong> button next to the <strong class="screenText">Preset</strong> drop-down menu for registering a preset, which is <a id="_idIndexMarker1279"/>marked in a red circle in <em class="italic">Figure 16.30.</em></li>

<p class="normal">What a great way of shading and highlighting your image. You might find the brilliant coordination of them totally by chance!</p>
<p class="normal">You have inked, colored, changed your line art, and shaded your artwork. Now, do you have fun <a id="_idIndexMarker1280"/>exploring the complete new color tones by<a id="_idIndexMarker1281"/> using Color Match and filters using the artwork you just finished? Read on to find out how.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-294">Using Color Match options and filters</h1>
<p class="normal">Color Match and filters <a id="_idIndexMarker1282"/>are fun tools to explore new <a id="_idIndexMarker1283"/>possibilities <a id="_idIndexMarker1284"/>for changing the final look of your artwork. It will be helpful for game art, especially when we are working with many artists together and use artworks from different artists but still want to have consistency in the game visual. For example, whenever a story takes a thrilling turn, all characters get the same Color Match option and filter, and if we keep this throughout the game, there will be a consistent tone throughout the game. This also helps you to try out different colors on your ordinary choice of color combinations or texture. This might be a good opportunity to step out of your comfort zone.</p>
<p class="normal">In this section, we are going to look at the Color Match options first then how to use them, and learn what the filters are and how you can apply them to your art. Read on to explore <a id="_idIndexMarker1285"/>different tones and textures on the<a id="_idIndexMarker1286"/> final looks of your art.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-295">The Color Match options</h2>
<p class="normal">Color Match comes <a id="_idIndexMarker1287"/>in handy when you are uncertain about the color balance. Yes, you can make a drastic color change to your art by matching colors to those of imported images or gradients.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s find out how to use it by following these steps.</p>
<p class="normal">First of all, you need to create a layer that contains all the materials you want to apply Color Match to by creating a layer folder and selecting <strong class="screenText">Merge selected layers</strong>. You can refer to the <em class="italic">Working with layers</em> section in <em class="italic">Chapter 3, Penciling: Layer and Layer Property Palettes</em> to see how to do it.</p>
<p class="normal">In the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu, click <strong class="screenText">Edit</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Tonal Correction</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Color Match…</strong>, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16.32.</em></p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a video game  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_16_16.32.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.32: Tonal Correction menu</p>
<p class="normal">This will bring up a Color Match dialog window. By clicking the image thumbnail, you can see your art change its color accordingly, as in <em class="italic">Figure 16.33</em>. When you disable <strong class="screenText">Maintain brightness</strong>, you can totally change the colors.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_16_16.33.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.33: Color Match image dialog window</p>
<p class="normal">Use the <strong class="screenText">Intensity</strong> slider<a id="_idIndexMarker1288"/> in the dialog in the preceding screenshot to control the strength of the color adjustment. You can also import your images by clicking one of those three icons on the right at the bottom of the window: from your folder, from your photo album, or by taking pictures (this can only be done on tablets and mobile phones). Or, delete images from the gallery by clicking the trashcan icon at the bottom right.</p>
<p class="normal">If you prefer using the <strong class="screenText">Gradient</strong> option, click <strong class="screenText">Gradient,</strong> and the dialog changes, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16.34.</em></p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_16_16.34.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.34: Color Match Gradient dialog window</p>
<p class="normal">By clicking the default <strong class="screenText">Somber Shade</strong> gradient set, you can pick any default gradient set from the<a id="_idIndexMarker1289"/> drop-down menu from <strong class="screenText">Somber Shade</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Sky</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Effect</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Tool (read-only)</strong>. You can find more gradients on <strong class="screenText">Clip Studio Assets</strong>, which you can learn how to access in <em class="italic">Chapter 18, Exploring the Clip Studio Assets and Animation</em>. Then, import downloaded gradient sets by clicking the down arrow with the square icon at the bottom.</p>
<p class="normal">Once you select the most suitable gradient, adjust it by using the adjustment bar on top by sliding the tiny arrows underneath if you want. </p>
<p class="normal">When you are satisfied with the result, click <strong class="screenText">OK</strong> to close the window.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Of course, you can apply the Color Match options to your grayscale artwork! Just draw your art in grayscale, use the <strong class="screenText">Color Match Gradient</strong> option, and see what happens. You might find a brilliant quick way to color your art!</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Well done, and what a brilliant way to change the whole mood of your drawing by using the Color<a id="_idIndexMarker1290"/> Match options!</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-296">Filters</h2>
<p class="normal">Clip Studio Paint<a id="_idIndexMarker1291"/> has tons of filters, which will come in handy once you know what they are! Just click <strong class="screenText">Filter</strong> on the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu and you will see a list of filters, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16.35</em>.</p>

<p class="normal">The options you see in the preceding screenshot are explained here:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Blur</strong>: This contains filters for blurring an image. Playing with different blur filters can give our illustrations a photographic effect and depth.

<p class="normal">We are particularl<a id="_idIndexMarker1292"/>y looking at two amazing filters: the <strong class="screenText">Chromatic aberration</strong> filter and the <strong class="screenText">Noise</strong> filter in the <strong class="screenText">Effect</strong> filters because they will give you imperfect but nostalgic looks in the artwork in a very fun way. Let’s jump into the wonderful usage of the <strong class="screenText">Effect</strong> filters! Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">First, create a raster layer that contains the materials you want to add a filter to by combining multiple layers into one (don’t forget to duplicate them before combining them).</li>
<li class="numberedList">Go to the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu, then click <strong class="screenText">Filter</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Effect</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Chromatic aberration</strong> to bring up the <strong class="screenText">Chromatic aberration</strong> dialog window, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16.37.</em></li>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 16.37: Chromatic aberration dialog window</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="3">Select how you want to apply <strong class="screenText">Chromatic aberration</strong> from <strong class="screenText">Radial (use center point</strong>) or <strong class="screenText">Lateral (use Angle</strong>) by clicking<strong class="screenText"> the Mode </strong>drop-down menu at the top of the preceding <a id="_idIndexMarker1293"/>screenshot. You can see the way the effects applied changes.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Adjust the intensity of the effect by sliding the <strong class="screenText">Intensity</strong> bar.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Adjust the direction of the effect by sliding the <strong class="screenText">Angle</strong> bar.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Once you like the result of the effect, click <strong class="screenText">OK</strong> to close the dialog window.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">Do you see the beauty of the art with the Chromatic aberration effect applied? The coloris now divided into red, green, and blue. Then, each color image was slightly off place, so you can see the image now looks like old printing with the colors not overlapping perfectly.This gives the image a nostalgic beauty. Let’s enjoy another wonderful filter: <strong class="screenText">Noise</strong>.</p>
<p class="normal">The<strong class="screenText"> Noise</strong> filter will give you a similar nostalgic impression. It simulates an old magazine image with textured imperfection. Follow these steps to use the <strong class="screenText">Noise</strong> filter:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Create a raster layer with all materials, which you have done in <em class="italic">Step 1</em> in the preceding guidance.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Go to the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu, and<a id="_idIndexMarker1294"/> then click <strong class="screenText">Filter</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Effect</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Noise</strong> to bring up the <strong class="screenText">Noise</strong> dialog window, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16.38.</em></li>

<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="3">Select a <strong class="screenText">Color Mode</strong> option, either <strong class="screenText">Color</strong> or <strong class="screenText">Gray</strong>, from the drop-down menu at the top of the dialog. The noise will be applied in RGB hues in the <strong class="screenText">Color</strong> mode, and black and white in the <strong class="screenText">Gray</strong> mode.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Increase or decrease the noise particles by sliding the <strong class="screenText">Noise strength</strong> bar or entering numbers in the box.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Once you like how the <strong class="screenText">Noise</strong> effect is applied, click <strong class="screenText">OK</strong> to close the dialog window.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">Now, you might be very impressed by how noise texture changes the whole impression of the image! Yes, the image now possesses a crafty printed-on-paper feeling. Of course, we can apply multiple filters on one image; keep experimenting <a id="_idIndexMarker1295"/>and have fun!</p>
<p class="normal">Next, we are adding a beautiful paper texture to our art; read on to find out.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-297">Adding a paper texture</h1>
<p class="normal">There is, of course, no <a id="_idIndexMarker1296"/>paper texture that really exists in digital <a id="_idIndexMarker1297"/>drawings since they’re not drawn on physical paper, but we can add it as a final touch to our art. We can express a sense of paper texture on a digital drawing using the pencil or watercolor tools to some extent, but it is easier to add it to the entire page by using texture materials and layer blending modes.</p>
<p class="normal">Follow these steps to add a rough paper texture to your art:</p>

<p class="normal">It’s done! Your image now has a rough paper texture!</p>
<p class="normal">If you have a look at the <strong class="screenText">Textures</strong> category in the <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> palette, you will find so many textures available, plus you can download new ones from Asset, too! You can try out tons<a id="_idIndexMarker1304"/> of textures, and you will find your favorite to<a id="_idIndexMarker1305"/> add to your art to make it truly unique!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-298">The Liquify tool adjustment</h1>
<p class="normal">This is not a coloring tool, but <a id="_idIndexMarker1306"/>we might need it for the fina<a id="_idIndexMarker1307"/>l touch once the color drawing has been done. The Liquify tool will distort our art however we want by the motion of our stylus. So, let’s say we are not satisfied with the face or body balance on our character drawing; we can use the Liquify tool to fix the imperfection!</p>
<p class="normal">Follow these steps to retouch your finished art:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Select all your layers, go to the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu, and click <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Create folder and insert layer</strong>.

<li class="numberedList">Select the <strong class="screenText">Blend</strong> tool from the <strong class="screenText">Tool</strong> palette and select <strong class="screenText">Liquify</strong> in the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> palette.

<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-299">Summary</h1>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we started applying color to our images. We started out by discussing reference layers and how we can use them to make our colored flats easier with anti-overflow brushes and the Fill tools. Then, we explored how to change line art color, and looked at three of the many blending modes available in Clip Studio Paint that can help us shade and highlight our images. We also learned how to shade using Shading Assist, changing the tone of a finished piece of colored art using the Color Match options, and we explored adding the <strong class="screenText">Chromatic aberration</strong> filter and the <strong class="screenText">Noise</strong> filter. We explored adding a paper texture to our art. Finally, we learned how to use the Liquify tool to retouch the finished art. You can apply these new coloring skills to both digitally drawn and scanned manga images, for a more polished and professional look.</p>
<p class="normal">In the next chapter, we are going to start talking about auto actions. Auto actions are tools that can help you save a lot of time and effort when creating your digital art. Read on to learn how!</p>
