- en: Bootstrap is one of the world’s most popular frontend UI toolkit and comes with
    easy-to-use and off-the-shelf solutions for building responsive websites with
    the use of components, utilities, JavaScript plugins, and more. You can customize
    Bootstrap 5 with Sass to achieve a unique-looking layout that stands out from
    the crowd. Learning how to customize Bootstrap 5 enables a developer to create
    something unique that doesn’t look like Bootstrap.
