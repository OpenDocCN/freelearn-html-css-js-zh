    supported by every major browser and platform, PWAs eliminate many of the missing
    capabilities previously reserved for native apps. If you are a developer who works
    on application frontends, you need to understand what progressive web apps are,
    their advantages, and how to effectively architect modern web apps.

    how HTTPS works through advanced service worker life cycle and caching strategies.
    The book covers web performance optimization practices and tools to help you consistently
    create high-quality progressive web apps.
