    more than 15 million artists around the world to create manga artwork. It is one
    of the most loved software among illustrators, manga artists, and comic writers
    due to its special features for drawing manga and comics. With just this software,
    a computer, and a graphics tablet, you can create black and white comics, fully
    colored comics, illustrations, and short animations.
