- en: Sencha Architect is an HTML 5 visual app builder that allows you to create Sencha
    Touch (mobile) and Ext JS (desktop) applications by dragging-and-dropping components
    and previewing your application live. All code built in Sencha Architect is designed
    to be best practice compliant, making it easy to build large applications or simply
    to learn. And all the code that is generated could be written manually by you,
    which demonstrates how powerful this tool is.
