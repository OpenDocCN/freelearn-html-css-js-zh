- en: The field of web development is an exciting one, where rapid technological changes
    are the order of the day. This can make it a challenging field when it comes to
    knowing where to start. When I broke into this field, all we really needed was
    a basic text editor such as Notepad, and some time to look at the code behind
    websites to glean the basics of what was involved in building them. Being self-taught
    was still difficult back then, but it was certainly easier as there wasn’t nearly
    as much to learn.

- en: Things are far from that simple now though! Figuring out where to begin your
    journey is tricky. And then, when you *do* figure that out and learn the basics
    of the technology, you have to confront the challenge of entering the field in
    a professional capacity, which can be difficult when you don’t have a lot to demonstrate
    your capabilities.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then once you figure out how to crack *that* nut, the challenge shifts to
    keeping up with the constant churn of technology, continuing to expand your capabilities,
    and learning how to fit in and do good work.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So yes, while it’s an exciting field, it’s also a challenging one. But I hope
    that I, through this book, will be able to draw on nearly 30 years of professional
    experience to help you start the journey on solid footing, building up a good
    foundation in technology, plus a lot of other skills you’ll need to be a successful
    web developer.
