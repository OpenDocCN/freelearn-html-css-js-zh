- en: 'Developing apps for mobile devices can be done using many different approaches
    and languages. Many apps are developed natively; meaning that they are developed
    in Java, Objective C, or some other language natively understood by the SDK available
    for the device. While native development allows the greatest flexibility and performance,
    the problem arises when you want to move an app from one platform to another:
    suddenly you''re writing the app nearly from scratch. Then if you want to move
    to another platform, the same thing occurs. There''s got to be a better way!'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All current mobile platforms support the idea of *web apps*. These are applications
    coded entirely in HTML and JavaScript. For simple apps, or for apps that don't
    need to interact with the device's capabilities, this works just fine. But the
    moment you need to access the file system, work with the camera, and so on, you
    start needing more access to the device.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is where PhoneGap comes in. PhoneGap (built on Cordova) wraps your HTML
    and JavaScript with just enough of a native app to let your web app feel more
    at home on the device. This wrapper is different for each platform, but exposes
    common capabilities in a consistent way. This helps you to write less code across
    multiple platforms.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since PhoneGap is wrapping your HTML and your JavaScript in a native shell,
    you also gain the ability to submit your app to the platform's app store—something
    you can't do with just a simple web app. Keep in mind, though, that most app stores
    want your app to look and feel something like a native app, and some are more
    strict than others when it comes to how the app should look and feel. Furthermore,
    don't just wrap your existing website that is hosted on some other server—many
    app stores will reject these kind of apps. Your app needs to have local HTML and
    JavaScript that supports the UI and interacts with the device.

- en: Which is where this book comes in. While we're using PhoneGap as the shell and
    the interface to some of the more interesting device abilities, we're not just
    repeating the PhoneGap documentation, either. Instead, there are full apps; each
    one designed to take advantage of one or more features of the device, yes, but
    also fully functioning apps.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book will hopefully show you how to take PhoneGap and make interesting,
    even exciting apps that are also cross platform. While we focus only on iOS and
    Android, the techniques within this book can be easily extended to BlackBerry,
    Windows Phone, and others with minor modifications.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Project 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Let''s Get Local!"), *Let''s Get Local!*,
    introduces us to PhoneGap with a simple quiz game. We''ll also be introduced to
    app localization by making the game available in English as well as in Spanish.
    We''ll also be introduced to the simple framework we''ll be using for the rest
    of the book.'

- en: '[Project 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Let''s Get Social!"), *Let''s Get Social!*,
    helps us develop a simple social app that displays feeds from select Twitter accounts.
    We''ll cover plugin installation into PhoneGap, for when we need access to native
    functionality that PhoneGap doesn''t supply.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Project 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Being Productive"), *Being Productive*, introduces
    us to an app, which like most apps needs to work with the file system for persistent
    data storage. It is a simple note-taking app and will allow us to fully explore
    creating, renaming, copying, and deleting files.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Project 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Let''s Take a Trip"), *Let''s Take a Trip*,
    helps us build an app that records the location of a user over a given period
    of time. This will require access to the GPS functionality of the device. We''ll
    also need to use Google Maps. We''ll build further on the file management introduced
    in [Project 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Being Productive").'
  prefs: []

- en: '[Project 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Talking to Your App"), *Talk to Your App*,
    helps us create an app that will record voice memos, and allow the user to play
    them back at will. Along the way we''ll integrate with PhoneGap''s audio capture
    and playback APIs.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Project 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Say Cheese!"), *Say Cheese!*, covers how
    to display thumbnails in a memory-efficient manner as display and capture of media
    is critically important in most apps. We''ll also interface with the device''s
    camera and photo gallery.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Project 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Let''s Go to the Movies!"), *Let''s Go to
    the Movies!*, is much like [Project 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Say Cheese!"), only
    here we''re dealing with video. We''ll be introduced to playing video on iOS and
    Android (each very different), and we''ll also be tasked with recording video.
    Finally, we''ll write our first plugin to extract a thumbnail from the video for
    display in the app.'

    us to a simple game that uses the HTML5 canvas to play a simple game, as there
    are plenty of apps that do something important, sometimes we just want to have
    fun. We''ll also work with the device''s accelerometer.'

- en: '[Project 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Blending In"), *Blending In*, takes an app
    previously developed and applies native components on to it so that it looks and
    feels more like a native app, because sometimes we just want to blend in. While
    this project is tailored specifically for iOS, you can use the concepts for other
    platforms.'

- en: '[Project 10](ch10.html "Chapter 10. Scaling Up"), *Scaling Up*, introduces
    us to the concept of detecting a tablet, since so far each app in this book has
    been tailored for a phone-sized device but tablets are quite prolific as well.
    We will also get acquainted with the common design patterns used to scale our
    app up to a tablet-sized device.'
