    to **LMS**) offered by Google to teachers. It provides a central location to communicate
    with students, share resources, pose questions, and create assignments. In an
    increasingly digital world, Google Classroom helps facilitate online learning
    for today''s digital learners. As with many new applications, Google Classroom
    comes with a unique look and feel. Since your method of setting up your physical
    classroom is as unique as your method of teaching, Google Classroom begins as
    a blank canvas. Before we can add students into Google Classroom, you will need
    to create online Classes for your physical classes.'

    Being the teacher of the Classroom will provide access to options that are not
    visible to students and will allow you to change settings, such as what students
    can do in Google Classroom. You will be able to add students to the Classroom,
    create announcements and assignments, and upload course materials from this *teacher*
    view of the Classroom. But first, you will need to create and set up your first
    Class.

    of the online Class before creating it. As creatures of habit, establishing online
    expectations through Google Classroom, similar to what we do in person, will help
    us and our students know where to turn. Examples of some of the questions I ask
    myself when planning an online Class include: *How do students ask questions?*
    *When is it appropriate for them to ask questions?* *Where do they find resources?*
    *How are they dismissed?* By establishing this structure at the beginning, you
    will feel less guilty about not responding when a student contacts you at 7:30
    in the evening with a question.'
