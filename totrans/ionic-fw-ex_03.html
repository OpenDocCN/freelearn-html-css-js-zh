We will start by learning to test our application using the simplest Ionic technique: by serving our app to the Chrome browser using the <code class="email">ionic serve</code> command. We will then go ahead and use the Ionic view mobile app for iOS/Android to see how we can test our application on a mobile device. Lastly, we will learn to run and deploy our Ionic application to a mobile device using the traditional build system of the native SDKs of our respective platforms.</p></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_1"><a id="ch03lvl1sec15" class="calibre1"/>Running our todo app</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre10">In the last chapter, we created our first Ionic application using the Ionic blank template. We worked on the application further, and made a to-do list app. We wrote some Angular code and had some initial exposure to some Ionic code. However, we did not get to see our application in action. There are many ways by which we can run an Ionic app, and the first technique we will be learning is the <code class="email">ionic serve</code> technique.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_2"><a id="ch03lvl2sec15" class="calibre1"/>The ionic serve technique</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre10">The <code class="email">ionic serve</code> technique<a id="id69" class="calibre1"/> is the simplest way to see your app in action. It requires no extra setup after the Ionic CLI, and only requires you to have a web browser. We are now going to test our <code class="email">todo</code> application, which we created in the<a id="id70" class="calibre1"/> preceding chapter using the <code class="email">ionic serve</code> technique. To test your application with this technique, simply open a new command-line window and follow the following steps.</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="tip03" class="calibre1"/>Tip</h3><p class="calibre10">
<strong class="calibre11">Browser choice</strong>
</p><p class="calibre10">It is advisable that you use<a id="id71" class="calibre1"/> Google Chrome as your default browser. Google Chrome has some very powerful development tools and all exercises in this book expect that you have Google Chrome installed as your default browser. You can download a copy <a id="id72" class="calibre1"/>of Google Chrome by visiting this URL: <a class="calibre1" href="http://www.google.com/chrome">http://www.google.com/chrome</a>.</p></div><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem" value="1">From your terminal, navigate to the root directory of your Ionic <code class="email">todo</code> application.</li><li class="listitem" value="2">Run the following <a id="id73" class="calibre1"/>command in your command-line<a id="id74" class="calibre1"/> window:<div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong class="calibre11">ionic serve</strong>
</pre></div><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="note02" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre10">In case you are prompted to select an IP address, you can select any one from the list prompted and press <em class="calibre14">Enter</em> to initiate.</p></div></li></ol><div></div><p class="calibre10">If you followed the steps correctly, you should see a browser window come up with your app running in it. You will also notice that the command-line window where you typed the command has some things going on within it.</p><p class="calibre10">With this, we have successfully served our application to the browser and can test our Ionic application like any other web application on Chrome. The great thing about this technique is the fact that no extra setup is required, and all you need is just Ionic CLI and the Chrome browser installed on your machine.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch03lvl3sec05" class="calibre1"/>Emulating with Chrome</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre10">Even though our <a id="id75" class="calibre1"/>application is served on the Chrome browser, it is fullscreen and is served like a normal fullscreen web app. This is not ideal for us, as our application is a mobile application. Luckily, Chrome has a neat emulation tool that lets you emulate your application as if it were running on a normal mobile phone.</p><p class="calibre10">To use Chrome's emulation feature, follow<a id="id76" class="calibre1"/> the following steps.</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="note03" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre10">These steps assume that you already have your app served on the Chrome browser and you are currently on the tab that it is served on.</p></div><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem" value="1">Click the Chrome menu icon, as shown in the following screenshot:<div><img src="img/00011.jpeg" alt="Emulating with Chrome" class="calibre12"/></div><p class="calibre25"> </p></li><li class="listitem" value="2">Scroll down<a id="id77" class="calibre1"/> to the <strong class="calibre11">More Tools</strong> options and select the <strong class="calibre11">Developer Tools</strong> option, as<a id="id78" class="calibre1"/> shown in the following screenshot:<div><img src="img/00012.jpeg" alt="Emulating with Chrome" class="calibre12"/></div><p class="calibre25"> </p></li><li class="listitem" value="3">Click the <strong class="calibre11">Device Mode</strong> toggle icon, as shown in the following screenshot:<div><img src="img/00013.jpeg" alt="Emulating with Chrome" class="calibre12"/></div><p class="calibre25"> </p></li></ol><div></div><p class="calibre10">This should bring <a id="id79" class="calibre1"/>up the Chrome emulator window with your app running on it. You might need to refresh the page for it to render the app correctly. If you have a look at the window, you will see a dropdown menu on the upper-left corner that has a list of devices that you can emulate. I normally recommend using the Nexus 5 for testing Android and the iPhone 6 for iOS. The reason for this is that the resolution of the Nexus 5 eclipses many of the Android phones available today so using it as a basis makes a lot of sense. The same goes for the iPhone 6 as well; since it is Apple's flagship device at the time of writing, it makes sense to use it for emulation.</p><div><img src="img/00014.jpeg" alt="Emulating with Chrome" class="calibre12"/></div><p class="calibre13"> </p><p class="calibre10">You can fully<a id="id80" class="calibre1"/> interact with your app as if it were running in an emulator. You also have the full power of the Chrome developer tools to<a id="id81" class="calibre1"/> inspect elements and see how the code of your application is represented. Why don't you have a go with your app and try and add some to-do list items and see them populating.</p></div></div></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_3"><a id="ch03lvl2sec16" class="calibre1"/>Ionic serve labs</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre10">There is <a id="id82" class="calibre1"/>another flavor in the <code class="email">ionic serve</code> technique that lets us see our app the way it looks on both iOS and Android simultaneously. This technique is called the<a id="id83" class="calibre1"/> Ionic labs technique.</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="tip04" class="calibre1"/>Tip</h3><p class="calibre10">This technique<a id="id84" class="calibre1"/> should only be used to view your app and is not intended to be used for debugging.</p></div><p class="calibre10">To view your<a id="id85" class="calibre1"/> app using the Ionic labs technique, simply follow the following steps.</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="tip05" class="calibre1"/>Tip</h3><p class="calibre10">If you are already viewing your app using the <code class="email">ionic serve</code> technique, simply press <em class="calibre14">Q</em> to quit the current session or close the command-line window and open a new one.</p></div><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem" value="1">Make sure<a id="id86" class="calibre1"/> you are in the root folder of your project.</li><li class="listitem" value="2">Enter the<a id="id87" class="calibre1"/> following command in your terminal:<div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong class="calibre11">ionic serve --lab</strong>
</pre></div><div><img src="img/00015.jpeg" alt="Ionic serve labs" class="calibre12"/></div><p class="calibre25"> </p></li></ol><div></div><p class="calibre10">Running this should bring up a new browser window the same way as it did the first time when we ran the <code class="email">ionic serve</code> command; only that this time, you will see two emulations for your app, one for iOS and one for Android, as shown in the preceding screenshot. This is a really nice way to see your app running in action on both platforms simultaneously. Ionic has a term called <a id="id88" class="calibre1"/>
<strong class="calibre11">Continuum</strong> which you will see in action in later chapters. This phenomenon refers to the fact that certain elements look different on different platforms. For example, tabs <a id="id89" class="calibre1"/>on iOS are normally placed on the bottom, while on Android, they are traditionally positioned on the top. Ionic offers us these features out of the box with a further way to<a id="id90" class="calibre1"/> override these behaviors. The <code class="email">ionic serve</code> technique is a great way to see the features like the tab positioned differently on different platforms simultaneously.</p></div></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_4"><a id="ch03lvl2sec17" class="calibre1"/>The Ionic view</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre10">Another technique to view an<a id="id91" class="calibre1"/> Ionic app is by using the Ionic view application. The Ionic view app is a mobile application created by Ionic with Ionic framework available on iOS and Android. The application is used to view any Ionic application you <a id="id92" class="calibre1"/>are developing and works hand-in-hand with the Ionic IO platform. The Ionic IO platform is a suite of tools that Ionic provides for some extra services like push notifications, analytics, and so on.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch03lvl3sec06" class="calibre1"/>Testing todo app with the Ionic view</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre10">In order to use<a id="id93" class="calibre1"/> the Ionic view app, you<a id="id94" class="calibre1"/> must have an iOS or Android device. You must also possess an<a id="id95" class="calibre1"/> Ionic IO account. Navigate to <a class="calibre1" href="http://apps.ionic.io">http://apps.ionic.io</a> to create your Ionic IO account. Go ahead and <a id="id96" class="calibre1"/>download the Ionic view app by visiting <a class="calibre1" href="http://view.ionic.io">http://view.ionic.io</a> on your mobile<a id="id97" class="calibre1"/> device and downloading the correct version for your mobile device.</p><p class="calibre10">In order to test our <code class="email">todo</code> application, follow the following steps to test it with the Ionic view app:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem" value="1">Open a terminal window and navigate to the root folder of your <code class="email">todo</code> application from <code class="email">Chapter 2</code>.</li><li class="listitem" value="2">Simply enter the following command on your terminal:<div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong class="calibre11">ionic upload</strong>
</pre></div></li></ol><div></div><p class="calibre10">This command will request the e-mail and password details of your Ionic IO account. Enter these details when prompted and if the app uploaded correctly, you should see a message saying <code class="email">Successfully Uploaded (APP_ID)</code>, where <code class="email">APP_ID</code> is an auto-generated identifier for you app.</p><p class="calibre10">Now you are ready to view the app on your mobile device. To do this, simply open your Ionic view app on your phone and login with the same Ionic IO account you uploaded your app to. You should see your application in a similar fashion to the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/00016.jpeg" alt="Testing todo app with the Ionic view" class="calibre12"/></div><p class="calibre13"> </p><p class="calibre10">From here, you <a id="id98" class="calibre1"/>simply tap the <code class="email">todo</code> app and a prompt will come up with a number of options. You should select the <strong class="calibre11">download files</strong> option. After this has finished, you can simply click the <strong class="calibre11">View App</strong> option. If you followed the instructions <a id="id99" class="calibre1"/>correctly, the <code class="email">todo</code> app should replace your current view and you should see it running within the Ionic view app.</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="tip06" class="calibre1"/>Tip</h3><p class="calibre10">You can simply tap the screen with three fingers to go back to the Ionic view menu at any time.</p></div><p class="calibre10">The Ionic view is<a id="id100" class="calibre1"/> a good way to view your application, and is extremely useful when you want to share progress with your friends, clients, or your boss about an app. It has a feature that lets you share to people's e-mails and you can find these documented in the Ionic official documentation. You<a id="id101" class="calibre1"/> can also manage the apps you upload to Ionic view from within the app or online via the<a id="id102" class="calibre1"/> Ionic IO website at <a class="calibre1" href="http://apps.ionic.io">http://apps.ionic.io</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>

To do this, however, you must have the native SDK for each platform installed on your computer. Let's take a brief look at how you can run an Ionic app on your device.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch03lvl3sec07" class="calibre1"/>Android</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre10">To run an Ionic app on a <a id="id104" class="calibre1"/>physical device, first you simply ensure that you have your Android device plugged in via USB. You also need to ensure that you <a id="id105" class="calibre1"/>have developer mode enabled in your computer with USB debugging on.</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="note04" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre10">This step assumes that you have already set up the Android SDK on your computer and you also have Cordova and Ionic set up on your machine.</p></div><p class="calibre10">Ensure that you are in the root folder of your project in a terminal window and run the following command:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong class="calibre11">ionic run android</strong>
</pre></div><p class="calibre10">If you have everything set up correctly, this command will build your app and run it on the device plugged into the computer automatically.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch03lvl3sec08" class="calibre1"/>iOS</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre10">To run an Ionic app<a id="id106" class="calibre1"/> on an iOS device, first you need to ensure that you<a id="id107" class="calibre1"/> have the <code class="email">iOS-deploy</code> package installed.</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="note05" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre10">You can only deploy your app to an iOS device using a Mac computer.
