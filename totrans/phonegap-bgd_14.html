The easiest way is to use the PhoneGap Developer App. It's a mobile application available for Windows, Android, and iOS platforms. Once you have installed the mobile application, you can easily test your project without actually building and installing the application on your physical device connected to the same wireless network as your desktop.</p><p>Once you have the project ready to test, you can use the <code class="literal">serve</code> command of the PhoneGap command-line tool to start a local server listening on an IP address. </p><div><img src="img/B03476_AppD_01.jpg" alt="The PhoneGap Developer App"/></div><p>Now, open the installed application in your device, enter the IP address listed on the command line, and click the <strong>Connect</strong> button. Now, your desktop computer and the mobile device will be wirelessly paired, and you can see your app on the device. Any changes made to the code will be instantly reflected on the device. The device APIs that do not work on <a id="id875" class="indexterm"/>browsers, will be working on your device even without installing the application.</p><p>More details and download<a id="id876" class="indexterm"/> links for all platforms can be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://app.phonegap.com">http://app.phonegap.com</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec112"/>The PhoneGap Desktop App</h1></div></div></div><p>To make our life<a id="id877" class="indexterm"/> easier, we now have a desktop app and you are now free to use it, instead of the PhoneGap command-line interface. You can create a new PhoneGap project, import an existing one, and start the local server with a single click. It's still not a mature product and many features are getting added every month.</p><div><img src="img/B03476_AppD_02.jpg" alt="The PhoneGap Desktop App"/></div><p>You can download<a id="id878" class="indexterm"/> the application for your Windows desktop or Mac OS at <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-desktop/releases">https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-app-desktop/releases</a>.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec113"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>We have seen some recent PhoneGap-related tools available for developers to make hybrid mobile application development much easier. Both the Developer App and Desktop App will help you to debug and test your applications without many difficulties.</p></div></body></html>
