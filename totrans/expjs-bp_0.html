Node.js is an especially exciting tool that is easy to use, allows you to build APIs, and develop your backend code in JavaScript. It powers the server side of web apps, including PayPal, Netflix, and Zenhub.</p><p>Express.js is the most popular framework that can be used to build on top of Node.js—it provides an essential level of abstraction to develop robust web applications. With the emergence of this minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework, creating Node.js applications has become much simpler, faster, and also requires minimal effort.</p><p>This book takes a pragmatic approach to leveraging what Express.js has to offer, introduces key libraries, and fully equips you with the skills and tools necessary to build scalable APIs from start to finish while offering subtle details and nuggets of wisdom that come from years of experience.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
