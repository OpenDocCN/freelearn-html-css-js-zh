The best way to understand this is by having a short history on mobile development, in general, and understand how tools like Ionic help mobile developers create beautiful mobile apps.</p></div>

<div class="book" title="Chapter&#xA0;1.&#xA0;First Look at Ionic" id="E9OE1-798adc86542b445d8a1bb648e10b6714">
<div class="book" title="The beginning"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_1"><a id="ch01lvl1sec08" class="calibre1"/>The beginning</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre10">The year 2006 saw the<a id="id0" class="calibre1"/> beginning of the smartphone era with the launch of the iPhone by Apple. By 2008, Google had launched its answer to Apple's iOS operating system. This new operating system was called <a id="id1" class="calibre1"/>
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre11">Android</strong></span>, and by 2010, it was clear that smartphones running iOS and Android dominantly covered the mobile ecosystem. Fast forward to today, the dominance of iOS and Android is not so different even though Windows for mobile by Microsoft has made some gains on the mobile front. It is fair to say that Android, iOS, and Windows make up the majority of the ecosystem with the first two at the forefront by a large margin.</p><p class="calibre10">The launch of the smartphone era also gave birth to the concept of mobile applications. Mobile apps are the medium by which we deliver and obtain most of our content on mobile phones. They are great and everyone with a smartphone pretty much has a number of apps downloaded on their devices to perform specific actions or achieve specific goals. This was massive for developers, and the software vendors also provided tools that enabled <a id="id2" class="calibre1"/>developers to create their own third-party mobile apps for users. We refer to these applications, built using the tools provided by the software vendors, as <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre11">native mobile applications</strong></span>.</p></div></div>

Firstly, for each mobile development platform, the software vendor provides its own unique set of tools to build applications for its platforms. We know these tools as SDKs. The following table shows how each platform differs in terms of tools and SDK options to create native mobile apps for their ecosystems:</p><div class="informalexample"><table border="1" class="calibre16"><colgroup class="calibre17"><col class="calibre18"/><col class="calibre18"/><col class="calibre18"/></colgroup><thead class="calibre19"><tr class="calibre20"><th valign="bottom" class="calibre21">

</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p class="calibre10">To make a clear statement, we are not trying to downplay the use of native tools. As noted earlier, native tools are great but come with a great cost and time constraint. Firstly, you are unable to build the same app for different platforms with the same set of tools. For the Android version of your app, you will need a team of skilled android developers. For the iOS version of your app, you will need a team of Objective-C or Swift developers to create the iOS version of the same app. Also, there is no code sharing between these two teams, meaning<a id="id4" class="calibre1"/> that a feature developed on one platform will have to be completely developed on the other platform again. This is highly inefficient in terms of development and very time consuming.</p><p class="calibre10">Another problem is that because you are hiring two separate teams that are completely independent of one another even though they are both trying to create the same thing, you are left with a growing cost. For example, if you decided you wanted to create a Windows for mobile version of your mobile app, you will need to recruit another team of .NET developers and they will have to build everything present on the other existing platforms from scratch since they cannot reuse any of the already built tools.</p><p class="calibre10">For a company like Facebook, which makes revenue in the billions, it might make sense to go down the native path as cost and talent for native development would probably not be a part of their concern. However, for the most part, not everyone building or trying to build a mobile app is a company like Facebook. Most people want to get a simple, great, powerful app out there as quick as possible. Furthermore, some of these people want to use their preexisting skill set to build apps for multiple platforms without having to learn new programming languages.</p><p class="calibre10">Before mobile applications, web apps ruled the world for the most part. We had more people developing for the web technologies consisting mostly of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. One great thing we got used to with the web was that it was platform independent. This meant that as long as you had a browser application on any device, you were able to interact with any web application without any problem.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00002.jpeg" alt="The problem" class="calibre12"/></div><p class="calibre13"> </p><p class="calibre10">So when mobile<a id="id5" class="calibre1"/> apps came, it was a big change for most web developers because with mobile apps, each platform was self-dependent, and apps made for one platform would not work for another platform.</p></div></div></div>

<div id="page" style="height:0pt"/><div class="book" title="Apache Cordova" id="F8901-798adc86542b445d8a1bb648e10b6714"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch01lvl1sec09" class="calibre1"/>Apache Cordova</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre10">Apache Cordova<a id="id6" class="calibre1"/> is a technology that lets any web application be packaged as a native mobile application while also providing access to device features. Thanks to Adobe and the open source community, this technology has seen great growth over the years and more and more apps are being built with Cordova. The apps built with Cordova are<a id="id7" class="calibre1"/> commonly referred to as <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre11">hybrid applications</strong></span>. But what is a hybrid app?</p><p class="calibre10">A hybrid application in the context of Cordova is actually a web app that lives within the thin container of a<a id="id8" class="calibre1"/> native mobile application.</p><p class="calibre10">In reality, the only difference between a native mobile app and a web application in terms of what they can do is the fact that the native mobile app has access to the device hardware features.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00003.jpeg" alt="Apache Cordova" class="calibre12"/></div><p class="calibre13"> </p><p class="calibre10">In truth, a <a id="id9" class="calibre1"/>hybrid app is actually a native app that serves up a web application on the phone's web view. It behaves and acts like a normal application and has complete device access, thanks to Cordova.</p><p class="calibre10">However, the main advantage that Cordova has over native development techniques is that you only have to maintain one code base, and can use that same code base to build applications for multiple platforms. This was and still is the main selling point of Cordova to date, as with this technique you are provided with a big cost and time saving advantage.</p></div>

<div class="book" title="Apache Cordova" id="F8901-798adc86542b445d8a1bb648e10b6714">
<div class="book" title="Early hybrid apps"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_1"><a id="ch01lvl2sec08" class="calibre1"/>Early hybrid apps</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre10">When the first few hybrid apps started rolling out, there were a couple of problems that seemed to persist. The first problem was that a lot of people complained that these hybrid applications did not<a id="id10" class="calibre1"/> have the same user interface and user experience as native mobile apps. The major reason for this was that when building a native app, all the building blocks are already provided for you. For example, we have things like pre-provided animations, swipe gestures, tabs, and so on. Hybrid apps failed to provide similar features like these because on the web, all we have is HTML, CSS, and JS. There is no pre-provided component for things like animations, gestures, and tabs.</p><p class="calibre10">This meant that pretty much anyone trying to build a hybrid app had to build these features from scratch. This was not very good and different people had different implementations of the same features. As a result, a lot of applications that were built by the hybrid way were<a id="id11" class="calibre1"/> not so visually appealing. What we needed was a framework that was centrally maintained that provided us with all the tools we needed to build features that native apps had with web technologies.</p></div></div>

<div id="page" style="height:0pt"/><div class="book" title="What is Ionic?"><div class="book" id="G6PI2-798adc86542b445d8a1bb648e10b6714"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch01lvl1sec10" class="calibre1"/>What is Ionic?</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre10">Ionic is a framework<a id="id12" class="calibre1"/> that lets you build hybrid mobile applications with web technologies like HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. But that is not where it stops with Ionic. Ionic provides you with components that you can use to build native-like features for your mobile applications. Think of Ionic as the SDK for making your Hybrid mobile application. Most of the features you have on a native app such as modals, gestures, popups, and many more, are all provided to you by Ionic and can be easily extended for new features or customized to suit your needs.</p><p class="calibre10">Ionic itself does not grant you the ability to communicate with device features like GPS and camera; instead, it works side-by-side with Cordova to achieve this. Another great feature of Ionic is how loosely coupled all its components are. You can decide to use only some of Ionic on an already existing hybrid application if you wish to do so.</p><p class="calibre10">The Ionic framework is built with AngularJS, which is arguably the most well-tested and widely-used JavaScript framework out there. This feature is particularly powerful as it gives you all the goodness of Angular as part of any Ionic app you develop. In the past, architecting hybrid applications proved to be difficult, but with Angular, we can create our mobile applications using the <a id="id13" class="calibre1"/>
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre11">Single Page Application</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre11">SPA</strong></span>) technique. Angular also makes it really easy to organize your application for the development and working across teams while providing you the possibility of easily adding custom features or libraries.</p></div>

Remember that <a id="id14" class="calibre1"/>a hybrid mobile application is simply a web application that runs in a web view, within a thin native wrapper environment.</p><p class="calibre10">Also remember that native apps came with already built components that enabled you to create beautiful user interfaces for mobile applications. Since hybrid apps used web technologies, there was no SDK or components provided for creating mobile UIs. The Ionic team saw this problem and created a solution in the form of the Ionic framework. The Ionic framework provides UI components to build beautiful hybrid applications.</p><div class="book" title="Features of Ionic"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch01lvl3sec01" class="calibre1"/>Features of Ionic</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre10">Ionic provides<a id="id15" class="calibre1"/> you with a lot of cool neat features and tricks that help you create beautiful and well functioning hybrid apps in no time. The features of Ionic come under three categories:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">CSS features</li><li class="listitem">JavaScript features</li><li class="listitem">Ionic CLI</li></ul></div><div class="book" title="CSS features"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title3"><a id="ch01lvl4sec01" class="calibre1"/>CSS features</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre10">To start off, Ionic comes stock with a great CSS library that provides you with some boilerplate styles. These<a id="id16" class="calibre1"/> Ionic CSS styles are generated with <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre11">SASS</strong></span>, a CSS <a id="id17" class="calibre1"/>preprocessor for more advanced CSS style manipulation.</p><p class="calibre10">Some of the cool CSS features that come built-in with Ionic include:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Buttons</li><li class="listitem">Cards</li><li class="listitem">Header and footers</li><li class="listitem">Lists</li><li class="listitem">Forms elements</li><li class="listitem">Grid system</li></ul></div><p class="calibre10">All these features and more, are already provided for you and are easily customizable. They also have the same look and feel that native equivalents have so you will not have to do any editing to make them look like native components.</p></div><div class="book" title="JavaScript features"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title3"><a id="ch01lvl4sec02" class="calibre1"/>JavaScript features</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre10">The JavaScript features <a id="id18" class="calibre1"/>are at the very heart of the Ionic framework and essential for building Ionic apps. They also consist of other features that let you do things from under the hood like customize your application or even provide you with helper functions you can use to make developing your app more pleasant. A lot of these JavaScript features actually exist as HTML custom elements that make it easy to declaratively use these features.</p><p class="calibre10">Some of these features include:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Modal</li><li class="listitem">Slide box<div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00004.jpeg" alt="JavaScript features" class="calibre12"/></div><p class="calibre25"> </p></li><li class="listitem">Action<a id="id19" class="calibre1"/> sheet<div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00005.jpeg" alt="JavaScript features" class="calibre12"/></div><p class="calibre25"> </p></li><li class="listitem">Side menu<div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00006.jpeg" alt="JavaScript features" class="calibre12"/></div><p class="calibre25"> </p></li><li class="listitem">Tabs<div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00007.jpeg" alt="JavaScript features" class="calibre12"/></div><p class="calibre25"> </p></li><li class="listitem">Complex<a id="id20" class="calibre1"/> lists<div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00008.jpeg" alt="JavaScript features" class="calibre12"/></div><p class="calibre25"> </p></li><li class="listitem">Collection repeat</li></ul></div><p class="calibre10">All the JavaScript features of Ionic are built with Angular, and most can be easily plugged in as Angular directives. Each of them also perform different actions that help you achieve <a id="id21" class="calibre1"/>specific functions and are all documented in the Ionic website.</p></div><div class="book" title="The Ionic CLI"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h4 class="title3"><a id="ch01lvl4sec03" class="calibre1"/>The Ionic CLI</h4></div></div></div><p class="calibre10">This is the final part that<a id="id22" class="calibre1"/> makes up the three major arms of the Ionic framework. The Ionic CLI is a very important tool that lets you use the Ionic commands via the command line/terminal. It is also with the Ionic CLI that we get access to some Ionic features that make our app development process more streamlined. It is arguably the most important part of Ionic and it is also the feature you will use to do most actions.</p><p class="calibre10">Ionic CLI features<a id="id23" class="calibre1"/> let you do the following:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Create Ionic projects</li><li class="listitem">Issue Cordova commands</li><li class="listitem">Development and testing</li><li class="listitem">Ionic splash/Icon generator</li><li class="listitem">Ionic labs</li><li class="listitem">SASS</li><li class="listitem">Upload app to Ionic view</li><li class="listitem">Access <code class="email">Ionic.IO</code> tools</li></ul></div><p class="calibre10">The Ionic CLI is <a id="id24" class="calibre1"/>a very powerful tool and most of the time, it is the tool we will be using throughout this book to perform specific actions.
