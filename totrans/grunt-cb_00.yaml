- en: Grunt is a task automation tool that provides the platform for an ever-growing
    ecosystem of plugins. These plugins provide the actual implementation for the
    tasks that can be automated. File management, testing, deployment, template rendering,
    code generation, and much more can be automated using easily configurable tasks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Grunt platform's key strength lies in the simple methodology it has defined
    for task configuration, and the fact that all the plugins it supports tend to
    adhere to this methodology. This provides developers with a faster way to start
    using tools that would previously have taken more time to learn, while also presenting
    the configuration in a standard format that can be easily understood, manipulated,
    and shared.

    kinds of tasks that your projects need to perform on a regular basis. We'll start
    with the most basic and common tasks, work our way up to creating our own tasks,
    and eventually generate entire sites using only Grunt.

    of recipes will be provided. Many of the recipes will explore the automation of
    similar tasks, using different tools or libraries. Each recipe also explores popular
    variations on its theme, just in case you have more specific needs.
