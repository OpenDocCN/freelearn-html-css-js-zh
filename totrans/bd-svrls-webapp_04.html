<p>The frontend is the easiest layer to go serverless. You just need a service to host your website's static files, and the user's browser will download the files, render the pages and execute the client-side JavaScript code. On AWS, the service we will use to host the frontend pages is Amazon S3. In this chapter, you'll also learn how to configure and optimize your website by adding a CDN and the supporting HTTPS connections.</p>
<p>In summary, we are going to cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using Amazon S3 to host static files</li>
<li>Configuring Route 53 to associate your domain name with S3</li>
<li>Using CloudFront to serve files through a CDN</li>
<li>Requesting a free SSL/TLS certificate to support HTTPS connections</li>
</ul>
<p>After this chapter, you'll have learned how to host a frontend in a serverless infrastructure.</p>

<p>Amazon S3 is extremely useful because it is a cheap service that provides high availability and scalability, requiring zero management effort. The infrastructure is fully managed by AWS. In this section, we are going to use S3 to host our website static files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images. You will see that this is done by uploading the files to a bucket and configuring S3 to enable website hosting.</p>
<p>Besides hosting static websites, you can also host complex applications. You just need to have a clear separation of concerns: the <em>frontend</em> files (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) will be hosted on S3 and will be used by the browser to render the web page and request additional data to the <em>backend</em> code, which will be hosted and executed by Lambda functions. As we are going to discuss in <a href="6cb9ccdc-61f3-437d-81ac-d05ec652f1a4.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Building the Frontend</em>, you can build your frontend as an SPA. This requires the browser to render the pages. Alternatively, you can use Lambda to serve server-side rendered pages.</p>

<p>In <a href="246b3080-28af-4aa3-805f-5fbf9908caae.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Getting Started with AWS</em>, we created a bucket using the CLI. In this section, we are going to use the Management Console to create another bucket so you can see the configuration options that S3 offers.</p>
<p>Let's perform the following steps to create a bucket:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first step is to browse the S3 console at <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3">https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3</a> and select the <span class="packt_screen">Create bucket</span> option:</li>

<ol start="2">
<li>We are creating a new bucket to host the website. If you don't have a domain name, you can still use S3 to host the website. You will have to access it from a URL in the following format: <kbd>http://my-bucket-name.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com</kbd>. If you have a domain name, such as <kbd>example.com</kbd>, you <em>must</em> set the bucket name with the same name as that of your domain, in this case, <kbd>example.com</kbd>. It is mandatory that you match the domain with the bucket name to allow Route 53 to make the association. As for the region, choose the one that is closer to your target audience:</li>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Handling errors</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>There are four common ways to handle errors using S3. I will explain the options you have, but before I do that, let me define what I mean by "handling errors". When a user makes an HTTP request, S3 may fail to get the answer and it will return a status code to explain the failure. An HTTP 500 <em>Internal Server Error</em> could be a possible result, but it would be extremely rare and odd. However, S3 returning either a 404 <em>Not Found</em> or 403 <em>Forbidden</em> error is pretty common.</p>
<p>404 <em>Not Found</em> is an error that will be returned when the user browses your website for a page that does not exist. For example, if you have a page named <kbd>company.io/about</kbd> and the user incorrectly browses <kbd>company.io/abot</kbd>, S3 won't be able to find the <kbd>abot.html</kbd> file and will return a 404 error. <span>Another example is when you use a JavaScript framework to create a <strong>Single-Page Application</strong> (<strong>SPA</strong>). Although your frontend code knows how to serve the <kbd>/about</kbd> page, the framework will not create a physical <kbd>about.html</kbd> file to upload to S3, and a 404 error will be returned even when browsing <kbd>company.io/about</kbd>.</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">We are going to discuss SPA in <a href="6cb9ccdc-61f3-437d-81ac-d05ec652f1a4.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Building the Frontend</em>. For the time being, note that an SPA can serve multiple pages, but there is only one complete HTML file, named <kbd>index.html</kbd> file.</div>
<p>403 <em>Forbidden</em> is an error that happens when the bucket has restricted permissions. If the bucket doesn't allow access to <em>everyone</em> or there is a specific file with restricted access, the 403 error will be returned. In my opinion, I prefer to consider <em>all</em> the files within the bucket public. If there is a page that shouldn't be public, showing the HTML file should not be a problem. The objective is to protect the <em>data</em> and not the <em>layout</em>. Setting authorization and data visibility is something that needs to be handled on the server side, not the client side. Also, if there are static files that must remain private, such as photos, you can save them in another bucket instead of reusing the bucket that was created to host the website. These <em>photos</em> can be considered <em>data</em> and, likewise, need to be controlled by the backend with special care.</p>
<p>Considering that all the files of a bucket will remain public, and that we don't need not worry so much about strange S3 errors, the only problem that we need to handle now is 404 errors.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>A very common approach to handle 404 errors for an SPA is to add a redirection rule in the <span class="packt_screen">Static website hosting</span> page using the <kbd>ReplaceKeyPrefixWith</kbd> option:</p>
<pre>
    &lt;RoutingRules&gt;<br/>      &lt;RoutingRule&gt;<br/><strong>        &lt;Condition&gt;</strong><br/><strong>          &lt;HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals&gt;</strong><br/><strong>            404</strong><br/><strong>          &lt;/HttpErrorCodeReturnedEquals&gt;</strong><br/><strong>        &lt;/Condition&gt;</strong><br/>        &lt;Redirect&gt;<br/>          &lt;Hostname&gt;<br/>            example.com<br/>          &lt;/Hostname&gt;<br/><strong>          &lt;ReplaceKeyPrefixWith&gt;</strong><br/><strong>            #!/</strong><br/><strong>          &lt;/ReplaceKeyPrefixWith&gt;</strong><br/>        &lt;/Redirect&gt;<br/>      &lt;/RoutingRule&gt;<br/>    &lt;/RoutingRules&gt;
</pre>
<p>With this solution, when the user browses <kbd>company.io/about</kbd>, the address will be replaced by <kbd>company.io/#!/about</kbd> and the <kbd>index.html</kbd> file will be returned. If you have an SPA, it can identify which page needs to be displayed and render it correctly. If the page doesn't exist, it will be able to render a generic 404 page. Also, you can configure HTML5's pushState to remove the hashbang sign (<kbd>#!</kbd>) after the page loads, but it will make the page to blink.</p>
<p>The drawback of this approach is that you need to choose between a polluted URL with <kbd>#!</kbd> or experience the page blinking when it is loaded.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Instead of setting a redirection rule, you can set an error document with <kbd>index.html</kbd>. This is the easiest solution for SPAs. When the user requests an <kbd>/about</kbd> page that doesn't have a physical <kbd>about.html</kbd> file to match, the <kbd>index.html</kbd> file is loaded and the SPA reads the address and understands that it needs to serve the contents of the <kbd>/about</kbd> page.</p>
<p>This configuration is what we have done in the previous image and it works pretty well without polluting the URL address with <kbd>#!</kbd> and without blinking the page when loading. However, search engines may refuse to index your website because, when browsing the <kbd>/about</kbd> page, the result's <kbd>body</kbd> message will be set using the correct page, but the <kbd>status code</kbd> will still be set as 404. If the Google crawler sees a 404 error, it will understand that the page doesn't exist and the page content is probably a generic error page.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>You can set the error document to <kbd>index.html</kbd>, as in the previous solution, but using CloudFront instead of S3. CloudFront provides a <em>custom error response</em> setting that allows you to change the status code of the <kbd>response</kbd> object. In this case, we can configure CloudFront to act on 404 errors, returning S3's <kbd>index.html</kbd> file and modifying the <kbd>status code</kbd> to <kbd>200 <em>OK</em></kbd> instead of returning 404.</p>
<p>If you opt for this, the problem is that you will return status code 200 even for pages that doesn't exist. </p>

            <article>
                
<p>Another issue with the other solutions is that <strong>Search Engine Optimization</strong> (<strong>SEO</strong>) is not considered, because they require JavaScript to be enabled in the browser to render the correct page. Since most web crawlers can't execute JavaScript code, they will not be able to index the webpage. This problem is solved with prerendering.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, you are going to learn how you can prerender pages. This technique creates physical pages for SPA routes. For example, in an SPA, the <kbd>/about</kbd> page doesn't have an <kbd>about.html</kbd> file, but with prerendering, you will be able to create it.</p>
<p>When you prerender all the possible pages and upload the files to S3, there will be no need to worry about 404 errors. If the page exist, S3 will find an HTML file for it. We still need to configure the error document to <kbd>index.html</kbd> to handle pages that doesn't exist, but we don't need to configure CloudFront to force the status code 200.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>A domain name without the <strong>www</strong> anchor text is usually referred to as a <em>naked</em> domain. For instance, <kbd>www.example.com</kbd> is a domain with the www anchor and <kbd>example.com</kbd> is a naked domain. The <em>canonical</em> URL is the option that you choose as the main address.</p>
<p>There are pros and cons that you'll need to consider when deciding which address should be your website's main one. One issue with using naked domains is that if your site has cookies, then placing static files in a subdomain, such as <kbd>static.example.com</kbd>, will not be optimized because each browser request for static files will automatically send cookies that were created for <kbd>example.com</kbd>. If your login happens at <kbd>www.example.com</kbd>, you can place static content inside <kbd>static.example.com</kbd> without worrying about cookies.</p>
<p>This issue can be mitigated by creating another domain or using a CDN to retrieve the static files. Despite this, the current trend is to drop the www anchor. It looks more modern to brand your tech company as <kbd>company.io</kbd> than it does using the old <kbd>www.company.com</kbd> format.</p>
<p>Choose your main address, but support both formats. Some people are used to adding www to the address and some of them may forget to include it. In the previous example, we created a domain without the www address. Now we are going to create another bucket, in the <kbd>www.example.com</kbd> format, and set the <span class="packt_screen">Static website hosting</span> configuration with the <span class="packt_screen">Redirect requests</span> option to target the address without www:</p>

<p>Uploading is pretty straightforward. Let's perform the following steps to upload static files:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, create a very simple <kbd>index.html</kbd> file for testing purposes:</li>
</ol>
<pre>
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br/>        &lt;html&gt;<br/>            &lt;title&gt;My Page&lt;/title&gt;<br/>        &lt;body&gt;<br/>            &lt;h1&gt;Hosting with S3&lt;/h1&gt;<br/>        &lt;/body&gt;<br/>        &lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>When you click on the main bucket name, an <span class="packt_screen">Upload</span> button will be made available. Click on it:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" height="410" src="assets/5001da1d-cb8d-4bac-b7a7-9053555a0886.png" width="515"/></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>The next screen is simple. Click on <span class="packt_screen">Add files</span>, select the <kbd>index.html</kbd> file, and continue by clicking on <span class="packt_screen">Next</span>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" height="481" src="assets/c04237b1-2b72-4ca1-abd2-f850d72ae508.png" width="479"/><br/></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>At the <span class="packt_screen">Set permissions</span> step, under <span class="packt_screen">Manage public permissions</span>, select the option <span class="packt_screen">Grant public read access to this object(s)</span>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" src="assets/288cd06e-1f6c-47ae-bc94-9caafa7e11ca.png" width="479"/><br/></div>
<ol start="5">
<li>At the <span class="packt_screen">Set properties</span> step, keep the default option for <span class="packt_screen">Storage class</span> as <span class="packt_screen">Standard</span> because files will be frequently accessed. Also, set <span class="packt_screen">Encryption</span> to <span class="packt_screen">None</span> because all the files will be publicly available, and therefore, adding an extra layer of security is not necessary and will only slow down your responses. As for the <span class="packt_screen">Metadata</span> fields, you don't need to set them:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" height="442" src="assets/a8e62c85-9cd0-4528-a022-579309c94e4d.png" width="439"/></div>
<ol start="6">
<li>Finally, review the options and confirm by clicking on <span class="packt_screen">Upload</span>.</li>
<li>Now you can check whether it is working by browsing the bucket's endpoint, for example, <kbd>http://example.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com</kbd>.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">If it doesn't work on the first try, clear your browser cache and try again because when you test the endpoint before uploading a file, the browser may cache the information indicating that the link is invalid. This may avoid further requests for a short time.</div>

<p>We have gone through the necessary steps to upload our site's frontend using the S3 console. It's easy and fast, but it's also pretty easy to automate this task. If you haven't configured the AWS CLI, as instructed in <a href="246b3080-28af-4aa3-805f-5fbf9908caae.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Getting Started with AWS</em>, do so now and see how useful it is to automate the uploading of files. In fact, what we are going to do is synchronize the bucket contents with a local folder. The CLI will upload only the modified files, which will make the upload much faster in future when your site grows.</p>
<p>You can execute the following command to upload your files:</p>
<pre>
<strong>aws s3 sync ./path/to/folder s3://my-bucket-name --acl public-read</strong>

<p>The gzip file format is a standard format used on the Web to compress files and improve the download speed by reducing the transferred file sizes. It can lower the bandwidth costs for you and for your users by providing smaller files. This approach has a huge impact on the perceived performance when loading the website.</p>
<p>It is currently supported by every major browser. By default, for every request, the browser will add an <kbd>Accept-Encoding: gzip</kbd> header. If the server supports gzip, the file is sent in compressed form.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows an HTTP request without gzip support:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" height="121" src="assets/26db65cb-1b15-4635-a7ec-9b5e434a5ea4.png" width="415"/></div>
<p>The following diagram shows how much bandwidth you can save with gzip. The compressed response is usually 10 times smaller:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" height="127" src="assets/f75fb39d-f681-4660-a8e2-be1e28310e6b.png" width="431"/></div>
<p>With this format, the server needs CPU time to compress the file and the user's browser needs CPU cycles to decompress the same file. However, with modern CPUs, the time to compress/decompress is much lower than the extra time taken to send the uncompressed file through the network. Even with low-end mobile devices, the CPU is much faster than the mobile network.</p>
<p>However, there is a problem. Since we don't have server-side processing with Amazon S3, there is no option to natively compress files in response to requests. You need to compress them locally before uploading the files and setting the metadata to identify <kbd>Content-Encoding</kbd> as <kbd>gzip</kbd>. Thankfully, you can skip the trouble of including this step in the deployment workflow if you use CloudFront. As we are going to see later, CloudFront has an option to automatically compress all your files with gzip.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Route 53 is a DNS management service. You don't need to use it if you want to expose subdomains, such as <kbd>www.example.com</kbd>, however, it is indeed obligatory if you want to serve your website data under a naked domain, such as <kbd>example.com</kbd>, hosted on S3 or CloudFront. This is due to the RFC rule: you can't have a CNAME record for your domain root, it must be an A record.</p>
<p>What's the difference? CNAME and A records are both record types that help the DNS system to translate a domain name into an IP address. While CNAME references another domain, an A record references an IP address.</p>
<p>So, if you don't want to use Route 53, you can use your own domain management system, such as GoDaddy, to add a CNAME that will map your <kbd>www.example.com</kbd> domain to an S3 endpoint, for example, <kbd>www.example.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com</kbd>. This configuration works fine, but you can't do the same for <kbd>example.com</kbd> because the IP address of the <span><kbd>example.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com</kbd> endpoint changes frequently and your third-party domain controller (GoDaddy, in this example) won't follow the changes.</span></p>
<p>In this case, you need to use Route 53 because it will allow an A record to be created referencing your S3 bucket endpoint, such as <kbd>example.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com</kbd>. You just need to say that this endpoint is an alias and Route 53 will be able to track the correct IP address to answer DNS queries.</p>

<p>If you register your domain address with Amazon, a hosted zone will be automatically created. If you register your domain with another vendor, you will need to create a new hosted zone.</p>
<p>A hosted zone allows you to configure your domain's DNS settings. You can set where your naked domain and subdomains are hosted and configure other parameters, for example, a <em>mail exchange</em> record set.</p>
<p>To create a hosted zone, perform the following steps:</p>

<p>A CloudFront distribution is what makes it possible to associate a DNS configuration (Route 53) with CloudFront to distribute static content. A distribution needs an origin server to know where the files are stored. In our case, the origin will be the S3 bucket that was previously configured.</p>
<p>Let's perform the following steps to create a CloudFront distribution:</p>
<ol>
<li>Browse the CloudFront Management Console at <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront">https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront</a> and click on <span class="packt_screen">Create Distribution</span>:</li>

<ol start="3">
<li>The next screen is a big form that we need to fill out. In the first fieldset, <span class="packt_screen">Origin Settings</span>, the <span class="packt_screen">Origin Domain Name</span> option will provide a drop-down list of S3 endpoints.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">You should not use the endpoints provided here because some S3 configurations, such as redirects or error messages, won't be available when using this address.</div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Instead, use the endpoint that is available in the bucket properties inside the <span class="packt_screen">Static Website Hosting</span> settings. The difference between these S3 endpoints is that the suggested endpoint doesn't have the bucket region (for example, <kbd>example.com.s3.amazonaws.com</kbd>) and the endpoint that we will use does have the region (for example, <kbd>example.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com</kbd>). <span class="packt_screen">Origin ID</span> will be set automatically after you provide <span class="packt_screen">Origin Domain Name</span>.

<p>By default, CloudFront will cache all the files for 24 hours. It means that if you modify the files in your S3 bucket, you won't see any changes when browsing through a CloudFront distribution. Forcing a cache reset in your browser will not help because it's server-side caching. So, what's the recommended practice to handle caching? You have the following two options for this:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Server side</strong>: Create a cache invalidation request</li>
<li><strong>Client side</strong>: Add suffixes to all the static files when changing their contents</li>
</ol>

<p>Creating a cache invalidation request to CloudFront takes some minutes to process because CloudFront will need to contact all the edge locations and request them to clear their individual caches.</p>
<p>Since this will be a recurring task, I don't recommend that you use the CloudFront console. It's better to use the CLI. However, CLI support for CloudFront is currently only available at the preview stage. So you may need to enable it by running the following command:</p>
<pre>
<strong>    aws configure set preview.cloudfront true</strong>
</pre>
<p>To create a cache invalidation request for all files (path <kbd>/*</kbd>), execute the following command:</p>
<pre>
<strong>    aws cloudfront \<br/>      create-invalidation --distribution-id=DISTRIBUTION_ID --paths "/*"</strong>
</pre>
<p>You can find <kbd>DISTRIBUTION_ID</kbd> of your CloudFront distribution by looking at the CloudFront console or running the following CLI command:</p>
<pre>
<strong>    aws cloudfront list-distributions</strong>
</pre>
<div class="packt_tip">You can add <kbd>--query DistributionList.Items[0].Id</kbd> to the previous command in order to only output the distribution ID of the first distribution.</div>
<p>This solution requires a long time for the invalidation to take effect, and it doesn't solve the problem of client-side caching.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>When you browse a web page, the browser will cache all the files that were downloaded to display the page (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and so on) and avoid requiring the same files in the near future to improve performance. However, if you modify the contents of one file, how can you tell the browser to dispose of the previous cached content? You can't create an invalidation request because this time the cache is at the client side, not server side, but you can force the browser to make a new request by changing the name of the file that has been modified. For example, you can change the file name from <kbd>script.js</kbd> to <kbd>script.v2.js</kbd> and use its new name inside the HTML page:</p>
<pre>
    &lt;script src="<strong>script.v2.js</strong>"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p>Another option is to add a query string to the filename when declaring it inside the HTML page, such as the following:</p>
<pre>
    &lt;script src="<strong>script.js?v=2.0</strong>"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p>In this example, the filename was not changed, but the reference was changed, and this is enough for the browser to consider the previous cache invalid and make a new request to get the updated content.</p>
<p>The problem of both strategies is that you can't cache the HTML page. All other data can be cached, except the HTML page. Otherwise, the client will not understand that it should download a newer version of a file dependency.</p>
<p>To upload HTML files in such a way that they will never be cached, you must set the <kbd>Cache-Control</kbd> header to <kbd>no-cache</kbd> when uploading the files. In our website, after syncing a local folder with your bucket, upload the <kbd>index.html</kbd> file again, but this time, use the <kbd>cp</kbd> (copy) command and add the <kbd>Cache-Control</kbd> header:</p>
<pre>
<strong>    aws s3 cp index.html s3://my-bucket-name \<br/>      --cache-control no-cache --acl public-read</strong>
</pre>
<p>This strategy works pretty well, but it requires you to automate your build process to change the filenames or query string parameters for all changed files. <span>In the next chapter, we are going to build a React app using the "Create React App" tool. Thankfully, this tool is already configured to change the filenames of all the deployments. It adds random strings, as in the <kbd>main.12657c03.js</kbd></span> file.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Supporting HTTPS</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p><span>Unfortunately, Amazon S3 does not support HTTPS connections, it only supports HTTP. We have set the Route 53 record sets to use a CloudFront distribution, but we haven't enabled support to HTTPS in CloudFront yet.</span></p>
<p>But why should we support HTTPS? There are many reasons nowadays. Let's list some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are building an online store. We need to handle logins and payment transactions. Doing such things without an encrypted connection is not safe. It's too easy to eavesdrop the network and steal sensitive data.</li>
<li>HTTP/2 is the newest protocol and is much faster than the old HTTP/1.1 version. Currently, <em>all</em> major browsers that support HTTP/2 <em>require</em> HTTPS. It is not possible to support HTTP/2 over an unencrypted HTTP connection.</li>
<li>HTTP/2 with encryption is faster than HTTP/1.1 without encryption. Troy Hunt shows an interesting demo at this link: <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/i-wanna-go-fast-https-massive-speed-advantage">https://www.troyhunt.com/i-wanna-go-fast-https-massive-speed-advantage</a>. In his test, loading a website with hundreds of small files was 80 percent faster with HTTP/2 over TLS due to the multiplexing feature of the newer protocol.</li>
<li>Another good reason is privacy. Using HTTPS everywhere helps to keep your browsing data safe. It's not enough because the domain names of the sites that you visit will continue to be exposed, but it helps a lot. The pages that you visit and the things that you read or write will not be (easily) compromised because data will always be transferred with encryption.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are convinced and want to support HTTPS, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a mail exchange record in Route 53.</li>
<li>Request a free SSL/TLS certificate to AWS.</li>
<li>Edit the CloudFront distribution to use this new certificate.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first step, to create a mail account, is necessary because AWS will only issue a free SSL/TLS certificate if you prove that you own the domain, and this verification is done by following a link sent to the <kbd>admin@example.com</kbd> e-mail address.</p>

<p>We need a service that will handle e-mail messages before we request our free certificate to AWS. I suggest Zoho Mail as a free option (up to 5 GB space). In this section, we will see how to configure this service by performing the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, browse <a href="http://www.zoho.com/mail">www.zoho.com/mail</a> and sign up for a free <em>business</em> e-mail account. This account will be associated with your domain. When selecting the administrator account, choose the name <kbd>admin</kbd>. This name is important because AWS will check your domain ownership by sending a confirmation e-mail to <kbd>admin@example.com</kbd>.</li>
<li>After you create your account, you will be requested to confirm the ownership of the associated domain. There are a few options to prove your ownership, and I prefer using the CNAME method. In the <span class="packt_screen">Select your domain's DNS Manager (DNS Hosting provider) from the list</span> option, choose <span class="packt_screen">Others..</span> because AWS is not listed. Now, select <span class="packt_screen">CNAME Method</span>, and the <span class="packt_screen">CNAME</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Destination</span> will be presented. You need to configure a new temporary Route 53 record set with this pair and finish clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">Proceed to CNAME Verification</span> button:</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
<li>After verifying, confirm the creation of the <kbd>admin</kbd> account. You can add in the sequence other users.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>The next step is to configure MX (mail exchange) records in Route 53. Copy the values that are presented by Zoho:</li>
</ol>

<ol start="5">
<li>Go back to Route 53. Delete the CNAME record set that was created to verify your Zoho account because it is no longer necessary. Now you need to create a new record set of the type MX using the values from the preceding screenshot:</li>
</ol>

<ol start="6">
<li>We are done. You can test whether it is working correctly by sending an e-mail to this new address and by checking your Zoho e-mail account for received e-mails.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let's see how to request free certificates with AWS Certificate Manager by performing the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Request a TLS certificate at <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home?region=us-east-1">https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home?region=us-east-1</a>.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">You need to be on us-east-1 because CloudFront only uses certificates from this region.</div>
<ol start="2">
<li>On the welcome screen, click on <span class="packt_screen">Get started</span>. In the next screen, type your naked domain name and the www version and click on <span class="packt_screen">Review and request:</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" height="511" src="assets/0b0a779c-f324-4ae8-a5c0-82eed3a82a93.png" width="750"/></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>In the following screen, you just need to click on <span class="packt_screen">Confirm and request</span>. Amazon will try to prove your domain ownership by sending an e-mail to <kbd>admin@example.com</kbd>. If you have configured your e-mail account correctly in the previous section, you will receive an e-mail in your Zoho inbox.</li>
<li>The e-mail has a confirmation link that you must click on to prove your ownership. After that, Amazon will issue a new TLS certificate that will be available for your account.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox">You don't need to worry about the certificate expiration date. AWS will renew it automatically when necessary.</div>

<p>The last step to support HTTPS is to edit the CloudFront distribution to use the new certificate. To perform this task, take a look at the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Browse the CloudFront Management Console at</span> <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront">https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront</a> and open your distribution.</li>
<li>Under the <span class="packt_screen">General</span> tab, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> option.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Click the <span class="packt_screen">Custom SSL Certificate (example.com):</span> option and select your domain certificate using the drop-down button:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" height="480" src="assets/169b6130-fe64-4b84-86ab-a5e244a20945.png" width="600"/></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Save to return to the previous page, then click on the third tab, <span class="packt_screen">Behaviors</span>, and click on <span class="packt_screen">Edit</span> to edit the existing behavior.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Now we can change the <span class="packt_screen">Viewer Protocol Policy</span> parameter to <span class="packt_screen">Redirect HTTP to HTTPS</span> to force the users to always use HTTPS:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="image-border" height="347" src="assets/b3be0f11-99cb-4981-a1b5-e6304abc7ce2.png" width="457"/></div>
<ol start="6">
<li>After changing these settings, CloudFront will automatically deploy the new configuration to all the edge nodes.</li>
<li>After waiting for some minutes, you can browse your domain to confirm HTTPS support.</li>
</ol>

<p>In this chapter, you learned how to configure S3, CloudFront, and Route 53 to host a serverless frontend solution. Now you have your site distributed all around the world for reduced latency and increased speed along with HTTPS support to make the Web more safe and private.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we are going to build the frontend of our serverless store application using React as an SPA.</p>
