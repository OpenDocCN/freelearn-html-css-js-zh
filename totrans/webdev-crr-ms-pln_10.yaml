    engines and other online tools effectively, how to make effective use of developer
    tools that aren’t focused on producing code but rather ensuring the quality of
    the code you write, and your ability to multitask. These are things that anyone
    can learn and know, regardless of your level of experience, and that should become
    habits over time (even if you stop consciously thinking about them after a while).

    level of quality and always producing solid results, but without killing yourself
    to achieve it. Your boss will want this of you, but if you take personal pride

- en: You have probably heard the expression “Don’t sweat the small stuff.” The idea
    here is to not let stress build by worrying about things that have a low impact,
    or that you can’t do much about. However, in earlier chapters, I made the point
    that attention to detail is a key attribute of a good developer. “Sweating the
    small stuff,” as I like to say, is what web development is all about.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Having good attention to detail is an important skill to cultivate in yourself
    because while it’s obvious that big mistakes can lead to big problems, small oversights
    can sometimes snowball into significant issues as well, if not necessarily with
    the same immediacy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, you *do* have to sweat the small stuff in this field, but the phrase, in
    this case, isn’t about managing stress – it’s about being as thorough and as accurate
    in your work as you can be, accounting for as much as you can, whether big or
    small. This is a crucial skill in producing work that is as robust, efficient,
    and bug-free as possible.
  prefs: []

    your designs meet both current and future needs are the things we’re most interested
    in doing well and with proper attention to detail.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As an example, let’s say that you’re building a website that involves storing
    user information. This involves writing information to a relational database.
    You might decide that the key of your user table – the column that uniquely identifies
    a user – should be a combination of each person’s first and last names. This might
    seem reasonable at first, and in fact, it would work perfectly fine, at least
    for a while. But what happens if two people with the same first and last name
    – a situation that certainly can occur in the real world – try signing up? Due
    to a relatively small mistake in the database’s design, a new user can’t even
    register due to the name conflict. Or worse, the system could, depending on how
    the code is written, comingle the two people’s data. Ironically, as I wrote these
    words, I’m dealing with a situation where my insurance company has somehow comingled
    my and my dad’s accounts precisely because we have the same first and last names.
    You wouldn’t think things like that happen for real, but you’d be very wrong!

- en: So, learning to pay attention to details is important. It can also be difficult
    because, especially early in your career, you won’t have much experience to base
    your observations on. All you can do at that point is to try and think through
    various scenarios, game them out, and look for gotchas as best you can. Experience
    isn’t a guarantee of success, nor is it always needed. Thinking logically – another
    point I’ve made a few times – is ultimately what it comes down to. Of course,
    the more experience you have, the better you will be able to think logically since
    you’ll have more information to base it on, but it’s not the be-all, end-all of
    attention to detail.

- en: You also have to be a little bit careful if you focus too exclusively on the
    minutia of a project as you can sometimes lose the forest for the trees, as the
    saying goes. You also always need to be mindful of the big picture and keep sight
    of the overall goals and objectives that the details work to achieve. Striking
    the right balance is what’s needed, and that primarily comes from practice. You’ve
    got to do these things and exercise these mental muscles to build them up properly
    over time.

    the moment.” It’s easy for all of us to become distracted by the various trials
    and tribulations of life – we all have things working in the back of our minds
    almost all the time, things we’re worried about or persistent problems we’re trying
    to solve – but the trick is to learn to push that stuff way back in your mind
    and focus on the here and now, on the main problem at hand.

- en: If your mind is wandering or pre-occupied by things other than, for example,
    working on that database mentioned earlier – even if you don’t immediately realize
    it’s happening – you will often find your focus isn’t where it needs to be, and
    you’ll wind up missing details that could have led you to better decisions, such
    as the problem with the key of the database if you use names. The problem with
    the key may have occurred to you if you were fully focused on that design task
    and not allowing your mind to wander (there are never any guarantees of course,
    but you want to give yourself the best odds at least).
  prefs: []

    you can take to help you achieve this – things we call **mindfulness exercises**.
    These are practices that are designed to help bring your attention to the present
    moment and help you become more aware of your thoughts, feelings, and surroundings.
    They can be quite beneficial for improving focus, reducing stress, and enhancing
    overall well-being.

    also can be the most useful. All it takes is to focus your attention on your breath.
    Notice the inhalation and exhalation, the rhythm of it. It’s an autonomic function
    of your body, of course, something you rarely pay attention to (unless there’s
    a problem!), so focusing on it can be an interesting experience. When your mind
    inevitably wanders, gently bring it back to your breath, and re-focus on the moment.
    This can be done anywhere at any time, even for just a few minutes, and can not
    only help you learn to focus on details but can also serve as a fantastic way
    to simply relax, which also tends to aid in attention to detail.'

    but it’s something you can do at home. You simply lie down or sit in a comfortable
    chair and focus your attention slowly and deliberately on each part of your body,
    from your toes to the top of your head. You’re “scanning” your body, in other
    words. As you do, notice any sensations, tension, or discomfort in each part,
    and try to relax any tension you notice.'

    – any object will do – and focus your mind on just observing it for a minute or
    two. Notice everything you can about it, observing it as if you’re seeing it for
    the first time. If you happen to be near a window, finding a bird, squirrel, or
    other animal can be an especially enjoyable “object” to use for this exercise.'

    help you pay attention to detail during a given task, it’s an exercise that can
    hone your skill a bit by exercising it with a common example. This exercise involves
    paying full attention to the simple, everyday experience of eating! As you eat,
    take notice of the color, texture, and taste of your food. Chew slowly and be
    aware of the sensations and flavors in each bite. You can almost make a game of
    it! It will train your brain to focus more on the moment, getting it used to the
    sensation of doing so.'

    This involves becoming aware of the sensation of your feet touching the ground,
    the rhythm of your steps, and your breathing. Take note of the simple fact that
    your legs are moving more or less on their own! It’s kind of a weird thing to
    realize! Also, take care to see the sights, sounds, and smells around you as you
    walk.'

    it can help focus the mind! Fortunately, it doesn’t require buying a proper yoga
    mat and finding a good yoga class in your town. Instead, you can sit in a comfortable
    position and engage in slow, deliberate, light stretching, taking care to pay
    attention to the physical sensations in your muscles and joints as you move. The
    key here is to be very gentle because this exercise is supposed to be relaxing,
    so you don’t want to overdo it, especially if this isn’t a regular activity for
    you.'

    for a few minutes and allow your mind to wander for a little while! You’d be surprised
    how just letting go for a minute or two can paradoxically help you re-focus on
    the task at hand afterward. In addition, it allows your mind time to process things
    at a lower level, which is often exactly what you need to break through a tricky
    problem or challenge.

    to know everything off the top of your head. There is simply too much to know
    – too much to keep in your meat-computer all at once. Instead, what *will* be
    expected of you is that you keep some general concepts in your head, particularly
    concerning the stuff you’re using at the moment in your head – if you’re currently
    writing a lot of JavaScript, then it’s reasonable (and, fortunately, natural)
    to start to remember things such as the methods available on arrays since you’ll
    be using those frequently
  prefs: []

    often used to describe this ability, playfully combining “Google” and “Kung-fu”
    to describe a person’s skill and efficient use of Google (or any search engine).
    It involves the ability to quickly find precise information.
  prefs: []

    the information you need.

    skills:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Effective keyword selection*: It should come as no surprise that choosing
    precise, relevant keywords is necessary to get you the information you need quickly.
    For example, searching for `array methods` won’t provide such specific results
    compared to `javascript array methods`. However, you also have to be aware that
    being *too* specific can result in missing some results that would have been useful.
    For example, searching for `javascript array methods that deal with collections`
    might filter out some sites dealing with methods such as `map()` and `reduce()`
    – this is because some sites might discuss these methods without actually using
    the word collections, so they wouldn’t match your query as much as others. Those
    sites may also be ranked lower in the results, causing you to miss them either
    way. It’s all about finding the right balance between being specific *enough*
    but not *too* specific.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Boolean operators*: Google allows you to use the same sort of Boolean keywords
    as most programming languages do, allowing you to craft more precise search terms.
    For example, searching for `javascript array methods for collections not map`
    can get you the results you need if you know that `map()` isn’t involved. The
    `and`, `or`, and `not` keywords are the most common Boolean operators to be used
    in this way.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Quotes*: When using a search engine such as Google, you have to understand
    the difference between using and not using quotes. When you use quotes, you’re
    telling Google to search for that *exact* phrase. Searching for `"javascript methods
    of array"` will only find pages that say `javascript methods of array` in that
    precise way.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Without the quotes, sites that contain the words `javascript`, `methods`, and
    `array` will be in the result (Google and most other search engines drop frequently
    used words such as `of` and `an`). As with effective keyword selection, quoting
    a search term can unnecessarily make your search too specific and cause you to
    miss good results.
  prefs:
  - PREF_IND
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Asterisks*: In a search term, an asterisk can be used as a wildcard. A wildcard
    essentially means “can be anything.” For example, searching for `*zamm*` means
    that so long as `zamm` appears in a result, there can be anything before and/or
    after it (or nothing before and/or after it) and it will match. So, for example,
    results with Zammetti in it would be found (because there’s nothing before `zamm`,
    which the leading asterisk allows for, and `etti` after it, which the trailing
    asterisk allows for), as well as the Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics
    (which is named ZAMM and therefore would satisfy the wildcards as well), ZAMM
    Foods, Zamm Advisors, and Alex Zamm.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You should use this sparingly as it can often lead to a lot of results unrelated
    to what you’re looking for, but it can sometimes be useful, especially if combined
    with other keywords and perhaps Boolean operators. For example, searching for
    `*zamm* mathematics, not advisors` might get you results more in line with technical
    materials while excluding those about cloud migration companies (Zamm Advisors).
  prefs:

    for can be found on a given site, but you might not be sure where specifically.
    In such cases, Google allows you to search specific sites by prepending `site:`
    to your search query. For example, to search the popular movie database site IMDB
    for information about the movie Predator, you could search for `site:imdb.com
    predator`. As a web developer, searching GitHub specifically is a common thing
    you’ll do when looking for an example of how to do something in code, so `site:github.com`
    is one to keep in mind.'

    engines, also allow you to search for specific document types. If you’re looking

    For example, you can find some chapters of one of my books about Flutter by searching
    for `filetype:pdf` `zammetti flutter`.'

    to a specific timeframe. In Google, it’s under the **Tools** menu that you should

    from just the past week or month, for example. This can be immensely helpful when

    such as Google is something you can practice. To do so, just think of a topic,
    and start trying some searches. As a general rule, if you have to look down past
    the fifth or tenth search result, then you probably could improve the search query.
    After a while, you’ll tend to find that the first couple of results will generally
    contain what you need; otherwise, it’ll tell you that your search query wasn’t
    quite good enough. This is a general rule and there will always be exceptions,
    but I’ve found it to be true the vast majority of the time when you’re crafting
    good queries. Keep working on queries that don’t give you the results you need
    quickly by making them more specific.

    I would encourage you to copy the entire error message and search for it literally
    (though I would always start with no quotes in it). It’s exceedingly rare that

    then, writing a literal question often yields better results. In my experience,
    it comes down to how common a question it is. For example, `how do I sort an array
    in JavaScript` is a common question developers ask, and so, AI results aside,
    you’re highly likely to get a good first web search result.

    are being mean or aren’t legitimately trying to help. Give them the benefit of
    the doubt, expand on the question if needed, and provide additional information,
    always while being polite. Of course, if you do run into people who just seem
    to want to make you have a difficult day, ignoring them is perfectly acceptable
    and probably the best thing to do in such situations.

    from the problem as possible so it’s focused as best you can. If you have a piece
    of code that isn’t working, try to remove any code that you are certain works
    and that isn’t necessary to understand the problem code. Developers rarely need

    problem” is too generic to be of value, but “JavaScript array sort not resulting
    in properly sorted array” is much more specific and isn’t overly long either.

    you may need to go through some back-and-forth to get there. And, of course, fight
    the urge to get frustrated if it takes a while or you ultimately don’t get an

    the answer was. This happens in the same way that rubber duck debugging does.

    a problem to a rubber duck. Yes, a real, physical, rubber duck like kids often
    play with in the bathtub! It sounds weird and silly, I know, but the simple act
    of explaining a problem, talking through what you’ve tried to resolve it, and
    detailing what you think could be the problem is all it takes to unblock your
    brain and have that “eureka!” moment you need. So, whether you get yourself an
    actual rubber duck, or just type a question on SO that you ultimately don’t even

    what happens. To be sure, you may sometimes get a reply like “No, that’s wrong,
    I tried that, do better next time” or something rude like that. Just ignore it

    make it perform better. Maybe there are security issues that will only be problems

    it where your source code is and it will go off and do its thing. Some of them
    have GUIs to make using them a little easier. Most can be integrated into your
    IDE and executed from there.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    CI/CD pipeline, and sometimes in drastic ways. For example, it’s often the case
    that the build will fail, alerting the entire development team if any SCA failure
    occurs. This helps to ensure that the code is in good shape before it’s pushed
    out and deployed for people to see, whether to a development environment or even
    to production.

    can result in a security exploit. It supports the notion of quality gates, which
    are rules that you can set that determine whether a review passes or fails. Since
    it can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines, the build can fail based on these gates
    if configured to do so. While SonarQube is generally seen as a very good tool,
    it can be a bit more complex to set up and use.'

    You’ll get back a report that details its findings, complete with links directly
    to the source code. It can not only detect problems in your code but can also
    point out dependencies you may be using that themselves have known exploits. Veracode

    particularly in detecting security vulnerabilities. It claims to test every line
    of code and potential execution path, and then state the root cause of each defect
    clearly, making it easy to fix problems. Some of the types of problems it can
    detect include resource leaks (when your code doesn’t properly clean up after
    itself and wastes things like memory), use of uninitialized data (a very common
    flaw that often leads to security vulnerabilities), and control flow issues (when
    the logic of your code can lead to code being executed that you don’t intend to).'

    CI/CD pipelines, and also IDEs, though the capabilities provided in each case
    can differ significantly. For example, while Veracode can be integrated into your
    IDE and report problems immediately, the capabilities are a bit limited since
    the cloud hosting model means the full capabilities of Veracode can’t run on your
    machine. This is just something to keep in mind when using these tools.

    tools support multiple programming languages and technology stacks. Other tools

  prefs: []

    daily workflow can significantly enhance code quality and maintainability, as
    well as reduce bug counts. Integrating them into your development workflow, including
    CI/CD pipelines, can streamline code reviews, enhance team collaboration, and
    enforce coding standards (which is something developers otherwise almost enjoy
    fighting about!). They are particularly beneficial in larger projects or teams,
    ensuring a unified code base despite multiple contributors.

    your code better in some way, be that more error-free, formatted well, or anything

    one that you should be using at all times, and that’s you – you and your brain!

    No one is perfect, of course, which is why we need these tools to be watching
    over our backs, so to speak, to catch what we miss. But if we’re doing things
    right, then there should be very little for these tools to catch anyway because
    we will, out of habit, have been writing our code with proper formatting all along,
    and with solid development principles all along.

    these tools can point out places you haven’t commented well, to some extent, this
    is by and large an area you have to do yourself because generally speaking, the
    machine doesn’t know what you’re thinking (some of the new AI-based tooling is
    starting to change this, but we’re still in early days of that, so it’s better
    to develop good habits yourself).

    such a way that they convey information about their purpose.'

    conveyed by just good variable and function names. That’s where comments in the
    code come into play. As I mentioned, there is a fair bit of debate about commenting
    in code, with some developers preferring as little as possible, while others would
    argue that there should be more comments than actual code in your code!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'In my experience, the best answer falls somewhere in the middle. One key tenet
    to keep in mind is that comments should explain the *why* of the code, not the
    *what*. In other words, you shouldn’t comment on every line of code explaining
    what it does because – assuming it’s written clearly, as described previously
    – the line tells you what it does anyway. The code itself is the what, so don’t
    do this:'

    and functions plus some judicious comments is sufficient. If you also have a blank
    line after the `saveToDatabase()` call before starting the next action, then the
    single comment has the benefit of logically grouping the lines. You can easily
    tell those six lines of code are related to updating the account, and the comment
    acts as a signpost for them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But even that comment might not truly be necessary (except for the aforementioned
    signpost) because it doesn’t explain *why* the code exists. Why are we adding
    a transaction and updating the account? The why of things is where comments come
    to earn their keep. Explaining how parts of the code work together is ripe for
    commenting. Describing any gotchas that might be in the code – that’s worth commenting.

    the function, as well as some details that might aid future developers (which
    may well be you!). You can also see what arguments it accepts, what it returns,
    and some conditions on its operation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the reasons some developers say that commenting is to be avoided is because
    “the comments lie.” What they mean is that if you modify that function such that
    it will return `null` rather than an empty `Account` object when `inLastName`
    is `null` – a change that might be necessary for some reason later – if you don’t
    update the comment along with the code then the comment will, in fact, “lie.”
    It tells you to expect an empty `Account` object when `inLastName` is `null`,
    but that’s no longer the case.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While some say you can avoid this by not writing comments, which is undoubtedly
    true, it’s not a good answer. Instead, the right way to solve that problem is
    to treat comments as being just as important as the code. When you change the
    code, get in the habit of changing the comment too. Some developers will update
    the comment first to, in a sense, give themselves a guideline for the work they’re
    about to do. Either way, don’t treat comments as an afterthought and you’ll tend
    not to wind up with “lying” comments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the end of the day, get into the habit of commenting more, not less, but
    also keep an eye out for superfluous comments. If you find yourself commenting
    more about what is happening rather than why, then you’re probably taking it too
    far, and it also may indicate that you haven’t written your code in a self-documenting
    way (because why would you need so many comments if the code didn’t make things
    obvious already?)

    it’s written. Even bad comments are like bad pizza: it’s still pretty good! Ultimately,
    it’s all about balance. Too much commenting that isn’t useful can just get in
    the way, but not enough is just as bad. Shoot for the middle ground.'

    multiple tasks at once. Of course, a human being just can’t do quite as much at
    a single time as a CPU can, but the CPU is pulling a trick on you. You see, it’s
    not doing multiple things at once either (I admit I’m simplifying this a bit here
    to make the comparison work, but it’s true enough at a high level to work). Instead,
    what a CPU is doing is switching between many tasks very fast – so fast that the

    coding and then redo the images – and sometimes that’s totally viable and probably
    the best way to go – but other times, redoing the images may then feed back into
    the HTML and CSS in some way that causes you to have to tweak that now (maybe
    you decide that you need to put shadows on the images, which means you may have
    to go back and remove the CSS that also puts shadows on them).

    the steps I’ve already taken. I’ll also write down what I plan to do next, and
    what I think is required going forward.

    even simple diagrams to help me pick up where I left off faster.

    time – my current choice is Google Keep, but you can use anything that lets you
    get to your information anywhere. I find this beneficial because sometimes you’ll
    have random, intrusive thoughts about a task during downtime, or during other
    tasks sometimes, and it’s helpful to be able to jot down notes about the thought
    in the same place all the other information about the task already is. That way,
    when I go back to the task, the thought is right there waiting for me (even if
    it immediately left my head after I wrote it down, which happens a lot!)

    and manage those tasks, and that can be stressful, notes or not. One part of that
    stress can come from poor time management. So, how do you manage the time allotted
    to each task in a way that this at least has a chance to reduce stress? One approach

    you either reach your hour time box limit or you finish earlier than that (which
    is always okay). Only then do you move on to the images, and again you would time-box
    that task as well.

    can usually wait until your current task is done. Of course, you may consider
    something you discover as you work to simply be part of the task at hand anyway,

    response for example, then an email is usually better than a phone call. If, on
    the other hand, they have a problem that is keeping them from continuing their
    work at all (what we usually call a **blocker**), then they may have no choice
    but to come over to your desk and get your immediate attention.

    the option of deferring! You can simply say “I’m right in the middle of something
    at the moment, let me get back to you as soon as I free up.” Yes, if they perceive
    their need as being more immediate, then they may not take it quite as well as
    they otherwise would, but at some point, that becomes a “not my problem” situation
    for you. After all, you have work to get done, and that’s hard to do if you can’t
    focus on it because you have to help others.
