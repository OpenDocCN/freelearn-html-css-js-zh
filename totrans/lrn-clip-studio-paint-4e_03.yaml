    a stage of the manga or comic creation process in which an artist sketches out
    a layout of the page with their pencil before they move on to the “inking” stage.
    In Clip Studio Paint, we have a great function for it! One of the best features
    of working in a digital art program is the ability to work in **layers**. We can
    use layers to edit and separate finished pencil artwork from ink artwork, and
    you will find tons more benefits as we read through this chapter!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Layers are like stacks of transparencies used for projection: every transparency
    carries a bit of text or an element of the image, so that we can separate the
    pencil sketch layer from the inked art layer, and when all the transparencies
    are stacked on top of each other, they form the complete image. You can make each
    layer visible or invisible with only one click, and manipulation of one layer
    doesn’t affect the other layer’s art. Most digital art software allows the creation
    of layers, and Clip Studio Paint is no exception. This chapter is all about the
    layers!'

- en: Penciling is one of the manga creation stages in which you draw a pencil sketch
    referring to a manga script before the inking stage. In the manga process, there’s
    often a first-draft pencil sketch and a second-draft pencil sketch. The first
    one is called **Ne-mu**, pronounced like “Name,” which is a very rough pencil
    drawing, with panels and speech bubbles to create an overall page draft.

- en: 'We do this to get a good visual plan of the page, and it’s important to show
    it to an editor, a designer, and/or a scriptwriter if you’re working with a publisher.
    After getting approval, we move on to a second pencil sketch, which is more detailed
    and easier to work on with inking pens. In the image on the right, we can see
    the whole process of the manga page creation, including the Ne-mu on the very
    left top and the second penciling sketch next to it:'

    the figure. We can see how figure drawings are composed in the following sketches:'

    until the proportions look right. The heads rule shown here is a good start! You
    may need to spend some time getting the head, arms, and legs the right sizes.
    It may be frustrating at first, but once you’re happy with the overall shape,
    you won’t have to worry about it again as you go into more detail with clothes,
    expressions, and so on. Of course, the more you practice proportions, the more
    intuitively they’ll come to you.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes, we realize we want to change the character’s pose after drawing the
    figure, but still want to refer to the original pose without erasing it. Layers
    come in handy in this case. Simply create a new layer, use a different colored
    pencil tool, and start drawing alternative poses on the new layer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    each other. Each element is drawn on a different layer, so we can move one element
    around at a time without affecting other drawings.

    It would have been more difficult to draw the blue alternative pose shown here
    if we didn’t have the black original pose as a reference. Penciling is a good
    time to make mistakes, so long as you iron them out before inking.

    On top of that, there is a layer with some gray, which is the carpet the character
    is standing on. Then, there is a layer with most of the colors of the drawing.

    layers easily by grouping them by color. For instance, when making an image with
    many characters, each layer related to one character can be assigned a layer color
    for easy identification.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To the right of the **Blending Mode** drop-down menu is a slider. This controls
    the opacity of the layer. Opacity refers to the amount of transparency that the
    objects on the layer have. If the slider is set to **100**, then the layer contents
    are at full opacity. If it is set to zero, then the layer contents will be completely
    transparent and therefore invisible. I normally set the sketch layer opacity to
    30% when I start inking on the layer above it so that we can see the inked line
    clearly!

    drawing, these tones were applied using a sticker-like sheet of pre-printed patterns
    that would be applied over the top of the drawing. Some companies even started
    printing background images, such as photos of city skylines or forests, to make
    the comic creation process faster and easier. This is now easy to create using
    digital tones. Using digital tones means we don’t have to replenish our screentone
    supplies, because we never run out, and we can make custom tones. We can find
    more about using screentones in the *Adding screentones* section in Chapter 12,
    *Making Masks and Screentones*.

    can be set in accordance with the color or brightness of the image. Changing this
    setting to increase the brightness will make lighter parts of the image more transparent.

    creation process. This is the best time to make mistakes, keep practicing, and
    eventually get the proportions right. It may be frustrating if you’re new to drawing
    figures, as well as being new to drawing on a tablet, but it will get better as
    you go. In fact, this could be seen as the hardest part of a composition; if you’ve
    got a good pencil sketch, the rest of the details will fall into place naturally.

    are and how to use them when creating your penciling sketch. We can use layers
    to add sketches in alternate poses or with additional foreground elements. Remember
    that, when you start inking your artwork on a new layer, you should reduce the
    pencil sketch layer’s opacity so you can focus on the ink. It’s also helpful to
    change the color of the penciling layer, to further distinguish it from the ink.

    freedom for experimentation while protecting each element of your artwork, making
    your piece easy and safe to edit. With that in mind, we learned about the **Layer**
    palette and the various options and icons it has. We also learned about the **Layer
    Property** palette and the different effects it can have on our layers. In *Chapter
    15* and *Chapter 16*, we will explore coloring in much more detail when we look
    at creating your color palette and exploring layer blending modes.
