    element tag or a complex animation; a website is not a website without color and
    action. Building styles for any online presence takes time and effort—we can reduce
    development time by using a preprocessor to automate the creation of styles, automatically
    apply vendor prefixes and the like, but the extra dependency of a library can
    be like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut!

    manner of features, such as variables, mixins, functions, and more. Although processors

    perform the post-processing, such as adding vendor prefixes or minifying the results.
    Once this is established, we can start to incorporate some of the plugins available
    for PostCSS that allow us to replicate functionality, such as from within SASS.
    Once we've adjusted existing code to use the format required by the plugins, we
    can then switch to using PostCSS, and begin to remove our dependency on using
    SASS.

    series of nodes. Each node in the tree contains a symbolic representation of an
    element in your code. In other words, if you had a condition statement that pointed
    to three possible outcomes, then the AST would have a single node, with three
    branches representing the possible outcomes.

    in the form of valid CSS. We can use this as a basis for creating our own plugins,

    plugins, and more, to help make the transition process easier and help remove
