This powerful functionality does not come for free, however; it requires well written JavaScript and CSS styling. The Kendo UI Framework for the Web provides prebuilt controls that give you this functionality for very little effort. This chapter will explore these controls and illustrate their use.</p><div class="section" title="Uploading files"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec58"/>Uploading files</h1></div></div></div><p>File uploads have<a id="id668" class="indexterm"/> traditionally been a clumsy element within web pages. Uploading multiple files was an even worse experience, often requiring multiple HTML upload elements which forced users to click on a separate button for every file. The Kendo UI Framework provides a specialized Upload widget that helps both users and developers in this process. Instead of clicking on buttons for every file, users can simply drag and drop as many files as necessary onto a web page and have them upload automatically, and asynchronously, in the background. Developers, likewise, can program to receive multiple files simultaneously and receive file uploads through JavaScript without causing web pages to become slow and unresponsive.</p><div class="section" title="Learning the Upload widget"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec84"/>Learning the Upload widget</h2></div></div></div><p>Since the <a id="id669" class="indexterm"/>Upload widget is designed to upload the contents of one <a id="id670" class="indexterm"/>or more files to a server, even the most basic implementation of this widget requires a server that can accept file uploads. You can accomplish this by using your ASP.NET MVC project. To receive the file uploads, you need to create an action method that accepts <code class="literal">IEnumerable&lt;HttpPostedFileBase&gt;</code> as an input parameter. The following is how the server will receive the files from the Kendo UI Upload widget:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">// Action method to receive uploaded files
[HttpPost]  // This attribute guarantees that only 
            // Form POST requests can call this action method
public ActionResult Submit(IEnumerable&lt;HttpPostedFileBase&gt; files)
{
  if (files != null)
  {
    // ... 
    // Process the files and save them
    // ...
  }

  return View();
}</pre></div><p>With this server code in place to receive the uploaded files, you can now build the page that will host the Kendo UI Upload widget from where the user will choose the files to upload. The <a id="id671" class="indexterm"/>following code sample shows an HTML form that has been configured for use as a Kendo UI Upload widget. Take special note that the form has two required input elements: a file input and a submit input. These are the normal input elements that you should expect for any form that uploads files, but in this case, there is also a <code class="literal">script</code> element<a id="id672" class="indexterm"/> that creates a special Kendo UI Upload widget on the file upload element.</p><p>Here is the HTML for the index view:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;form method="post" action="submit" style="width:45%"&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;input name="files" id="files" type="file" /&gt;  // HTML file upload
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit" class="k-button" /&gt; // Submit button
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $("#files").kendoUpload();  // Create the Kendo Upload Widget
  });
&lt;/script&gt;</pre></div><p>The following is how this markup will appear on an actual web page. Take special note that the file input element is displayed as a button instead of the normal style that you see with default HTML.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4346OT_10_05.jpg" alt="Learning the Upload widget"/></div><p>With all of this in place, you can click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Select</strong></span> button to choose a file to upload to the server. Once <a id="id673" class="indexterm"/>you have selected that file and clicked <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span>, the server will receive the file and will run any processing instructions that you have set in the server-side code.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4346OT_10_06.jpg" alt="Learning the Upload widget"/></div><p>The preceding screenshot shows the file selection dialog that will appear on the user's computer, so that he or she can choose the files to upload.</p><p>By adding a <a id="id674" class="indexterm"/>breakpoint within the <code class="literal">action</code> method code that receives the uploaded files, you can see how ASP.NET MVC interprets the posted data using Visual Studio 2012. The following is a screenshot of an uploaded file and the objects that display information about that uploaded file. In this case, I uploaded a small text file called <code class="literal">Reflection.linq</code>. You can see that the web server has received the file successfully and is able to process it as you see fit. This screenshot is showing Visual Studio in debug mode, which allows us to see the internal state of objects. Also, in this screenshot, we can see that the first object in the <code class="literal">IEnumerable&lt;HttoPostedFileBase&gt;</code> is a file with the <code class="literal">FileName</code> property value of <code class="literal">Reflection.linq</code>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4346OT_10_07.jpg" alt="Learning the Upload widget"/></div></div><div class="section" title="Enabling asynchronous uploads"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec85"/>Enabling asynchronous uploads</h2></div></div></div><p>While the <a id="id675" class="indexterm"/>upload experience that we just saw<a id="id676" class="indexterm"/> is already a superior experience to a traditional HTML upload element, the experience can get much better. JavaScript is now capable of sending file uploads asynchronously, or in the background, which means that the user does not have to submit a form that causes the page to reload. In other words, the process can run faster and smoother and requires less involvement. To enable this functionality, all you have to do is add the <code class="literal">async</code> configuration property to the Kendo Upload widget instantiation block. The following code sample shows how to do it:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;form method="post" action="submit" style="width:45%"&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;input name="files" id="files" type="file" /&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit" class="k-button" /&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $("#files").kendoUpload(
    {
      async: {       // async configuration
        saveUrl: "save",   // the url to save a file is '/save'
        removeUrl: "remove", // the url to remove a file is '/remove'
        autoUpload: true   // automatically upload files once selected
      }
    }
    );
  });
&lt;/script&gt;</pre></div><p>This functionality also requires some changes to the server. Although the majority of this code is the <a id="id677" class="indexterm"/>same as in the earlier example, <a id="id678" class="indexterm"/>this action method returns <code class="literal">ContentResult</code> instead of an <code class="literal">ActionResult</code>, because this action method is not sending a new web page back to the browser. Instead, it sends back a string result that notifies the JavaScript in the web page that the file upload(s) completed successfully. If something goes wrong with the file upload(s), the server will send an error code, such as a code <code class="literal">500</code> internal server error.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">public ContentResult Save(IEnumerable&lt;HttpPostedFileBase&gt; files)
{
  // The Name of the Upload component is "files"
  if (files != null)
  {
    foreach (var file in files)
    {
      // ...
      // Process the files and save them...
      // ...
  }

  // Return an empty string to signify success
  return Content("");
}</pre></div></div><div class="section" title="Uploading multiple files simultaneously"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec86"/>Uploading multiple files simultaneously</h2></div></div></div><p>By default, the <a id="id679" class="indexterm"/>Kendo UI Upload widget enables <a id="id680" class="indexterm"/>uploading multiple files at the same time, but you can specify this setting explicitly, as in the following code sample:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;script&gt;
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $("#files").kendoUpload(
      {
        multiple: true
      }
    );
  });
&lt;/script&gt;</pre></div><p>To upload multiple files, use the <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> key while you click on the files in the upload window. See the following screenshot for a display of multiple files selected at once. When you click the <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span> button, all of the files will be uploaded together to the server and will be processed in a single transaction. No more multiple buttons and dialogs required!</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4346OT_10_01.jpg" alt="Uploading multiple files simultaneously"/></div></div><div class="section" title="Removing uploaded files"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec87"/>Removing uploaded files</h2></div></div></div><p>As files are <a id="id681" class="indexterm"/>uploaded with the Kendo UI Upload widget, <a id="id682" class="indexterm"/>you will see a list of the filenames appear on the page in the file upload area. If you are using the standard upload behavior, not the <code class="literal">async</code> configuration, the files listed on the page have not yet been uploaded to the server. Rather, their filenames have been stored in preparation for when you click the <span class="strong"><strong>Submit</strong></span> button on the page to submit the HTML with the files attached. You can see a list of files in the following screenshot that have been marked for upload; they have not yet been sent to the server:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4346OT_10_08.jpg" alt="Removing uploaded files"/></div><p>Since these files have not yet been uploaded, you can click the <span class="strong"><strong>Remove</strong></span> button beside any of these files to <a id="id683" class="indexterm"/>remove them from the list without any side effects. <a id="id684" class="indexterm"/>If you are using the asynchronous file upload functionality, however, the files are uploaded instantly to the server and there is no way to remove them until they have already been fully uploaded. As you can see in this next screenshot, this file has already been loaded asynchronously to the server and has already been saved somewhere by that sever code:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4346OT_10_02.jpg" alt="Removing uploaded files"/></div><p>There is still a way to remove the file, but it requires some extra code on the server to make this work. Specifically, for removing asynchronous automatic uploads, another controller action method is required. This action method receives a list of one or more file names and deletes them from the server since they have already been uploaded and saved. The Kendo UI Upload widget calls this method automatically when the <span class="strong"><strong>Remove</strong></span> button is clicked on the page.</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">public ContentResult Remove(string[] fileNames)
{
  // The parameter of the Remove action must be called "fileNames"

  if (fileNames != null)
  {
    foreach (var fullName in fileNames)
    {
      // ...
      // delete the files
      // ...
    }
  }

  // Return an empty string to signify success
  return Content("");
}</pre></div></div><div class="section" title="Tracking upload progress"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec88"/>Tracking upload progress</h2></div></div></div><p>While a<a id="id685" class="indexterm"/> file is being uploaded asynchronously, <a id="id686" class="indexterm"/>you can see the progress of the upload with a progress bar displayed beneath the filename and a swirling circle of dots to indicate that the action is still occurring. The following screenshot shows a file upload in progress:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4346OT_10_13.jpg" alt="Tracking upload progress"/></div></div><div class="section" title="Cancelling an update in progress"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec89"/>Cancelling an update in progress</h2></div></div></div><p>While a file<a id="id687" class="indexterm"/> upload is taking place asynchronously, <a id="id688" class="indexterm"/>a button will appear beside the progress bar for cancelling the upload. If you click this button, it will attempt to cancel the asynchronous upload that is in progress. You should note that cancelling asynchronous uploads is never a guaranteed success. Most file uploads occur very quickly and it is unlikely that you will be able to cancel it in time. Also, even if you are able to click the <span class="strong"><strong>Cancel</strong></span> button in time, the process will still continue for a short period of time before the background threads respond to the cancellation. This is just to say that cancelling a file upload may work, but it also may not and it is hard to predict either way.</p></div><div class="section" title="Using file drag and drop"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec90"/>Using file drag and drop</h2></div></div></div><p>If you are<a id="id689" class="indexterm"/> using the asynchronous file upload functionality, <a id="id690" class="indexterm"/>there is another special feature that you can take advantage of. Since the asynchronous file upload processes the files immediately through JavaScript, the web page can enable some special behavior, such as dragging and dropping files onto the page using your mouse. This functionality is also enabled by default, so you can take advantage of it without any further configuration. All you have to do is drag a file from your computer and drop it on the screen where the Kendo UI Upload widget is present. As you drag the file onto the page, you will see the page react by showing some text instructing the user where to drop the file. When the file is dropped, the upload starts immediately.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4346OT_10_04.jpg" alt="Using file drag and drop"/></div></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="The Kendo UI Window widget"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec59"/>The Kendo UI Window widget</h1></div></div></div><p>JavaScript has<a id="id691" class="indexterm"/> long supported pop-up windows that can send messages to a user in a web browser. These messages can be simple text for the user to see, they can be <a id="id692" class="indexterm"/>confirmation boxes to ask permission, or they can even sometimes prompt the user to enter some information. Of course, these pop-up messages have two big problems. First, they are unattractive and have the appearance of a system message instead of a coherent portion of a website. Second, they have been so overused and abused in the past that many users disable them entirely or make it a habit to avoid sites that use them because they are annoying at best and a potential security risk at worst.</p><p>Modern web programmers have found a solution to this problem. JavaScript frameworks have been created that can create a different kind of pop-up message. Instead of using the actual system prompts that JavaScript did in the past, they have found a way to display hovering HTML <code class="literal">div</code> elements that are not actual pop-up messages at all, they are a true portion of the page that can be hidden or displayed on demand. The Kendo UI Window widget is a tool to build these nice hovering page elements.</p><p>Since the underlying concept to this technology is hiding and displaying specific HTML <code class="literal">div</code> elements, the basic use of this widget is simply to create a Kendo UI Window widget directly on a <code class="literal">div</code> tag. This will hide it until you are ready to show it and, once you are ready to show it, it will animate it onto the screen as a hovering element above the rest of your page. See the following code sample<a id="id693" class="indexterm"/> for a basic example:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;div id="window"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Windows Azure is a cloud computing platform

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;button id="windowButton"&gt;See Details&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $("#window").kendoWindow({
      width: "600px",
      title: "About Windows Azure",
      close: onClose
    });
    
    var onClose = function(){
      $("#windowButton").show();
    };

    $("#windowButton").on("click", function(){
      $("#window").data("kendoWindow").open();
      $("#windowButton").hide();
    });
  });
&lt;/script&gt;</pre></div><p>You can see the Kendo UI Window widget being created over the HTML element with an <code class="literal">id</code> value of <code class="literal">window</code>. The button with the ID of <code class="literal">windowButton</code> is wired up to open the Window widget and the event handlers hide this button while the Window widget is open and then show it again when the Window widget is closed.</p><p>The markup inside your <code class="literal">div</code> will be the markup inside the Window widget when it appears. This means that all of your styles and layouts are still shown properly in the same way as the rest of your page; there is no disconnect. The following is how this code looks when rendered on the page. Notice that the content of the Kendo UI Window widget is not yet shown, it must first be activated through an event; in this case that event is clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Show Window</strong></span> button:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4346OT_10_09.jpg" alt="The Kendo UI Window widget"/></div><p>This is how<a id="id694" class="indexterm"/> the Kendo UI Window widget looks when it is activated:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4346OT_10_10.jpg" alt="The Kendo UI Window widget"/></div><div class="section" title="Customizing Window actions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec91"/>Customizing Window actions</h2></div></div></div><p>The <a id="id695" class="indexterm"/>Kendo UI Window widget adds some <a id="id696" class="indexterm"/>default functionality to all windows that it creates. There is a button at the upper-right corner of the window, which is used as a close button, there is a title bar to give the purpose of the window content clear to the user, and the window is resizable if a user clicks one of the edges with a mouse and drags it. The buttons that appear in the upper-right corner of the Window widget can be customized for your web page and specific needs.</p><p>As you see, the only button that appears by default is the close button. However, there are three other buttons that can be added very easily: <code class="literal">Refresh</code>, <code class="literal">Minimize</code>, and <code class="literal">Maximize</code>. These buttons already <a id="id697" class="indexterm"/>have default functionality attached to them. The <code class="literal">Refresh</code> button will refresh the content inside the Window <a id="id698" class="indexterm"/>widget if it has been loaded from a remote source. The <code class="literal">Minimize</code> button will reduce the size of the Window widget to just the title bar. The <code class="literal">Maximize</code> button will enlarge the Window widget so that it takes up the entire web browser's screen size. After you click either the <code class="literal">Minimize</code> or <code class="literal">Maximize</code> buttons, a new special button appears for the sole purpose of restoring the Window widget back to its original position and size. Here is the code you need to use in order to enable these actions in your Window widget:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;script&gt;
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $("#window").kendoWindow({
      width: "600px",
      title: "About Windows Azure",
      actions: ["Minimize", "Maximize", "Close"],
      close: onClose
    });

    var onClose = function(){
      $("#windowButton").show();
    };

    $("#windowButton").on("click", function(){
      $("#window").data("kendoWindow").open();
      $("#windowButton").hide();
    });
  });
&lt;/script&gt;</pre></div><p>Here is how the Window widget appears with these actions enabled:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4346OT_10_11.jpg" alt="Customizing Window actions"/></div><p>Here is a minimized Window widget, note that the <code class="literal">Minimize</code> button has been changed to the button <a id="id699" class="indexterm"/>which <a id="id700" class="indexterm"/>will restore the original size and shape of the window:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4346OT_10_12.jpg" alt="Customizing Window actions"/></div><p>Here is a maximized Window widget in the next screenshot. Note that the <code class="literal">Maximize</code> button has been changed to the button that will restore the original size and shape of the window:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4346OT_10_13.jpg" alt="Customizing Window actions"/></div></div><div class="section" title="Loading content with AJAX"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec92"/>Loading content with AJAX</h2></div></div></div><p>All of the <a id="id701" class="indexterm"/>examples you have seen so far have displayed local content in the Window widget, or content already embedded in the web page.<a id="id702" class="indexterm"/> This is only useful in limited scenarios. The Window widget is much more flexible when it can load content from external sources, such as other web pages in your overall site. To make this work, you need to configure the Window widget with a content source. You can see an example of this in the following code sample:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;script&gt;
  $(document).ready(function() {
    $("#window").kendoWindow({
      width: "600px",

      close: onClose
    });

    var onClose = function(){
      $("#windowButton").show();
    };

    $("#windowButton").on("click", function(){
      $("#window").data("kendoWindow").open();
      $("#windowButton").hide();
    });
  });
&lt;/script&gt;</pre></div><p>With this enabled, the Window widget will load and display this external content as soon as it is <a id="id703" class="indexterm"/>activated. <a id="id704" class="indexterm"/>This has the added benefit that the loaded content is not downloaded until necessary, so the page will load somewhat faster. Here is a Window widget that has loaded external content in this way:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/4346OT_10_14.jpg" alt="Loading content with AJAX"/></div></div><div class="section" title="Using the animation effects"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec93"/>Using the animation effects</h2></div></div></div><p>When the <a id="id705" class="indexterm"/>Window widget is activated on the page, it animates onto the screen with some pleasant effects. By default, it will use the zoom effect which <a id="id706" class="indexterm"/>makes the Window widget appear as if it zooms in from a very small object into the full size. The other available effects are the toggle effect, the expand effect, and a choice of whether or not the Window widget animation should start as semi-transparent. The following code sample shows the animation effects as they are configured by default:</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note18"/>Note</h3><p>Note that no special animation configuration is included.

<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec60"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, we learned how to use the Window and Upload widgets. These widgets give you the power to create scalable and interactive web pages that your users will appreciate. Most importantly, these widgets provide ready-made solutions to very common web development problems so that you can focus on your code instead of solving repetitive problems.</p><p>In this book, we have seen a full array of the different Kendo UI Web tools that are available for developing powerful web pages. As you have seen in every chapter, these widgets are very friendly to use and offer a wide range of configuration options to be tailored to your specific needs and situation. Not only this, but Telerik has an active community of developers that can assist with implementation details through web forums and blogs and even paid support, if necessary. I hope you have enjoyed learning about the powerful tools available from Telerik in the Kendo UI Web framework. These tools will lower the overall time investment and effort involved in delivering rich web pages, and that is something most of us can happily appreciate.</p></div></body></html>
