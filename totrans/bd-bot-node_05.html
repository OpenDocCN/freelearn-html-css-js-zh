<strong>Telegram</strong> (<a class="ulink" href="https://telegram.org/">
https://telegram.org/
</a>) is a free, cloud-based mobile and desktop messaging app. Telegram takes us into a new era of messaging, which focuses primarily on security and the speed of the message delivery.</p><p>Telegram has clients for platforms including Windows, OS X, Linux 64 bit, and Linux 32 bit. The Telegram messaging app is available for use as a web version too. When it comes to mobile devices, Telegram has native apps for Android, iOS, and Windows Phone.</p><p>With Telegram, you can send messages, photos, videos, and files of any type (doc, zip, mp3, and many more); and you can create groups for up to 5,000 people, or channels for broadcasting your messages and media.</p><p>One of the great things about Telegram is that Telegram messages are encrypted and can be set to self-destruct. While chatting or messaging, for those who want more privacy and secrecy, Telegram has secret chats. This means only you and the recipient can see these messages; nobody else can see them, including Telegram. Such messages from this secret chat cannot be forwarded and, more importantly, when you delete such messages from your side, Telegram secret chat also deletes the messages from the other side as well.</p><p>In this chapter, we'll explore how to use Telegram. Also, we'll look at how we can build a Telegram powered bot that will act like a virtual assistant for us. This virtual assistant will provide information about the sentiments of our Telegram messages.</p><p>Sounds great!! Let's get started.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec30"/>How a Telegram bot works</h1></div></div></div><p>A Telegram bot is a special account that does not require an additional phone number to be set up. Users can interact with these bots in two ways:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Send messages and commands to bots by opening a chat with them, or by adding them to groups. This means of communication is used for typical chat bots.</li><li class="listitem">Send requests directly from the input field by typing the bot's username and a query. These are called inline bots.</li></ul></div><p>Such bots can enhance Telegram chats with content from external sources, can alert or notify you about news and translations, and can provide relevant information to you. Bots can even connect like-minded people looking for conversation partners within Telegram.</p><p>Technically, Telegram bots are third-party applications running inside Telegram. When a user sends a message to a Telegram bot, Telegram's intermediary server takes care of the encryption and communication with the help of Telegram bot APIs.</p><p>In this chapter, we will focus on chatting conversations (text interaction) by opening a chat with our bot and not calling it, with our Telegram bot.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec18"/>Setting up a Telegram account</h2></div></div></div><p>So far, we are just talking about Telegram and bots within it. In this section, we will actually start setting up our own Telegram account, followed by an account for our Telegram chat bot.</p><p>I am using the web version of Telegram to create my own account first. Open the browser window and enter the URL <a class="ulink" href="https://web.telegram.org/#/login">
https://web.telegram.org/#/login
</a>. This will launch a <strong>Sign in</strong> screen, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image00254.jpeg" alt="Setting up a Telegram account"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>Provide your <strong>Country</strong>, <strong>Code</strong>, and <strong>Phone number</strong>. Click on the <strong>Next &gt;</strong> link in the top-right corner to launch the next step, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image00255.jpeg" alt="Setting up a Telegram account"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>Enter the SMS code you have received, in the space provided, and you are set for your own account for Telegram. Once you enter your profile details, you can start messaging with the help of the following screen:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image00256.jpeg" alt="Setting up a Telegram account"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>With this, we have now set up our own Telegram account. You can start messaging your colleagues, and search for them as well. In the next section, we will start building Telegram powered bots.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec19"/>Setting up a bot account using a Telegram bot - @BotFather</h2></div></div></div><p>Sounds confusing! But this is the easiest way to start with Telegram bots. As I mentioned, Telegram bots are special accounts and, to set up these accounts, we will be using another Telegram bot named <em>BotFather</em>.</p><p>This is the awesome technique that Telegram has specially provided for developers to create their own bots. Here, we can see the capability of one bot that helps us in creating other bots.</p><p>Let's search for <code class="literal">@Botfather</code> and add it for our conversations, or you can directly open the URL <a class="ulink" href="https://telegram.me/botfather">
https://telegram.me/botfather
</a> to start conversations with BotFather. To start, BotFather will introduce itself and will display a <strong>START</strong> button at the bottom for the user.</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image00257.jpeg" alt="Setting up a bot account using a Telegram bot - @BotFather"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>Once you click on the <strong>START</strong> button, <strong>BotFather</strong> will provide you with all the commands that can be used for creating a new bot, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image00258.jpeg" alt="Setting up a bot account using a Telegram bot - @BotFather"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>Now, let's click on link <strong>/newbot</strong> from our conversation with BotFather. With this command, BotFather will ask us to choose a name for our bot.</p><p>Let me choose the name <code class="literal">MadansNewTelegramBot</code>. BotFather internally validates whether the name is available. If it is available, BotFather asks for a username for the newly created bot. I have provided a username for my bot. Refer to the following conversations for the same:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image00259.jpeg" alt="Setting up a bot account using a Telegram bot - @BotFather"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>With this, BotFather has created our bot and has also provided a token for our bot. This token will be used while wiring up our bot with Telegram bot APIs.</p><p>Now we can use this bot for conversations using the URL <code class="literal">telegram.me/MadansNewBot</code> or by searching for the name of the bot in the search field, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image00260.jpeg" alt="Setting up a bot account using a Telegram bot - @BotFather"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>After searching once, you select the bot for further conversations.</p><p>To summarize the steps carried out so far, we've created our own account at Telegram and also created a basic Telegram bot using BotFather. Our first Telegram bot will be a no-brain bot as there is no intelligence built within it.</p><p>In the next section, we will actually build some basic intelligence with the help of Node.js We will build a bot that will tell us the sentiments of our messages. But what is sentiment analysis? Let's spend some time in understanding sentiment analysis.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec20"/>What is sentiment analysis?</h2></div></div></div><p>In simple words, sentiment analysis is simply classifying a given term or a sentence as positive, negative, or neutral. This is also known as opinion mining or deriving the attitude of the person who is writing or speaking.</p><p>In relation to Telegram, sentiment analysis can be extremely useful for media monitoring and extracting opinions on some public topics.</p><p>Sentiment analysis can be achieved with approaches such as knowledge-based techniques, statistical methods, and a combination of both. Knowledge-based techniques classify text based on words' affinity to particular emotions, such as happy, sad, and so on. Statistical methods leverage elements of machine learning.</p><p>When representing the sentiments of a term or a sentence, words having a negative, neutral or positive sentiment to them are given an associated number on a scale of -10 to +10, and the level of sentiment or the score is determined at term or at sentence level.</p><p>Considering the scope of this book, we are keeping the sentiment analysis topic quite short.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec21"/>Creating a Telegram bot</h2></div></div></div><p>Now, let's see how we can use Node.js and Telegram bot APIs in order to create our basic Telegram bot. In the previous chapter we've seen how to get Node.js installed. For our Telegram bot, we'll follow a very similar process.</p><p>Let's start by creating a folder in our local drive from the command prompt in order to store our bot:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>mkdir telegrambot</strong>
<strong>cd telegrambot</strong>
</pre><p>Assuming we have Node.js and npm installed (if not, please refer to the steps in Chapter 1, <em>The Rise of Bots – Getting the Message Across</em>
), let's create and initialize our <code class="literal">package.json</code>, which will store our bot's dependencies and definitions:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>npm init</strong>
</pre><p>Once you have gone through the <code class="literal">npm init</code> options (which are very easy to follow), you'll see something similar to this:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image00261.jpeg" alt="Creating a Telegram bot"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>In your project folder, you'll see the result, which is your <code class="literal">package.json</code> file.</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image00262.jpeg" alt="Creating a Telegram bot"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>Just like we did in our previous example, we will use <strong>Express</strong> (<a class="ulink" href="http://expressjs.com">
http://expressjs.com
</a>) as our <strong>REST</strong> Node.js framework. We'll install it and save it to our <code class="literal">package.json</code> file as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>npm install express --save</strong>
</pre><p>Once Express has been installed, you should see something like this:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image00263.jpeg" alt="Creating a Telegram bot"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>With Express setup, the next thing to do is to install the <code class="literal">node-telegram-bot-api</code> package. This can be located at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/telegram-bot-api">
https://www.npmjs.com/package/telegram-bot-api
</a>.</p><p>In order to install it, run this npm command:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>npm install node-telegram-bot-api --save</strong>
</pre><p>You should then see something similar to this:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image00264.jpeg" alt="Creating a Telegram bot"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>Having done this, the next thing to do is to update your <code class="literal">package.json</code> in order to include the <code class="literal">"engines"</code> attribute. Open the <code class="literal">package.json</code> file with a text editor and update it as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">"engines": {&#13;
    "node": "&gt;=5.6.0"&#13;
}&#13;
</pre><p>Your <code class="literal">package.json</code> should then look like this:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image00265.jpeg" alt="Creating a Telegram bot"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>With our bot all wired up, we can then focus on creating the core logic for our conversations with the bot. Let's create our <code class="literal">app.js</code> file, which will be the entry point to our bot.</p><p>Our <code class="literal">app.js</code> should like this:</p><pre class="programlisting">var telegramBot = require('node-telegram-bot-api'); &#13;
 &#13;
var token ='267449059:AAGzHJFlDkzOG5SxyOJJT2yHsiC06Ut6ySE'; &#13;
 &#13;
var api = new telegramBot(token, {polling: true}); &#13;
 &#13;
api.onText(/\/help/, function(msg, match) { &#13;
  var fromId = msg.from.id; &#13;
  api.sendMessage(fromId, "I can help you in getting the sentiments of any text you send to me."); &#13;
}); &#13;
 &#13;
api.onText(/\/start/, function(msg, match) { &#13;
  var fromId = msg.from.id; &#13;
  api.sendMessage(fromId, "They call me MadansFirstTelegramBot. " +  &#13;
    "I can help you in getting the sentiments of any text you send to me."+ &#13;
    "To help you i just have few commands.\n/help\n/start\n/sentiments"); &#13;
}); &#13;
 &#13;
console.log("MadansFirstTelegramBot has started. Start conversations in your Telegram."); &#13;
</pre><p>Now let's look at the code snippet line by line. The first thing we do is to reference the node package we previously installed using npm.</p><pre class="programlisting">var telegramBot = require('node-telegram-bot-api'); &#13;
</pre><p>Once we have our reference set up, we are now connected to our bot. Remember, BotFather has provided a token to our bot for accessing Telegram bot APIs; we will be referring to the same token here, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><pre class="programlisting">var token ='267449059:AAGzHJFlDkzOG5SxyOJJT2yHsiC06Ut6ySE'; &#13;
var api = new telegramBot(token, {polling: true}); &#13;
}); &#13;
</pre><p>Now we have a handle to interact with our bot, through the token and bot APIs. Let's see how we can start the conversation with our bot. To start a bot, Telegram bots use the command <code class="literal">/start</code>. On entering the start command, my bot should introduce itself and also ask us how he can help us. This is achieved using the following code snippet:</p><pre class="programlisting">api.onText(/\/start/, function(msg, match) { &#13;
  var fromId = msg.from.id; &#13;
  api.sendMessage(fromId, "They call me MadansFirstTelegramBot. " +  &#13;
    "I can help you in getting the sentiments of any text you send to me."+ &#13;
    "To help you i just have few commands.\n/help\n/start\n/sentiments"); &#13;
}); &#13;
</pre><p>This basically tells our bot that if a user sends the command <code class="literal">/start</code>, our bot will send message in response to that with the help of <code class="literal">api.onText()</code>method.</p><p>Now let's run our Node.js program to start our conversation with the bot.</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image00266.jpeg" alt="Creating a Telegram bot"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>Now let's launch the Telegram web version for your own account.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec22"/>Conversations with our basic Telegram bot</h2></div></div></div><p>Search our newly created and Node.js wired bot using its name, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image00267.jpeg" alt="Conversations with our basic Telegram bot"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>Click on the <strong>START</strong> button, and the <code class="literal">/start</code> command will be sent to our bot to start the conversation. Once you've done that, you'll see our bot has responded to the <code class="literal">/start</code> command. Refer to the following screen:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image00268.jpeg" alt="Conversations with our basic Telegram bot"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>So, whatever we have written for the <code class="literal">/start</code> command in our <code class="literal">app.js</code> has executed and, through the Telegram bot APIs, the response is shown to us.</p><p>Now let's click on the <strong>/help</strong> command or type in <code class="literal">/help</code> for our bot. Our bot will respond to the <code class="literal">/help</code> command with following response, which we have wired into our Node.js program.</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image00269.jpeg" alt="Conversations with our basic Telegram bot"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>Since our Node.js program from <code class="literal">app.js</code> is running behind the scenes, our bot is responding to our commands based on what has been programmed in <code class="literal">app.js.</code>
</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl2sec23"/>Building a sentiment analysis bot</h2></div></div></div><p>Having built a very basic Telegram bot, let's build a sentiment analysis bot for Telegram. Within the context of Telegram, bots would be useful for content or media monitoring. Bots can actually classify terms or sentences that Telegram users are sharing with others. Knowing this, we will build a sentiment analysis bot using Node.js.</p><p>For sentiment analysis, we will be using the sentiment package for Node.js. Sentiment is a Node.js module that uses the AFINN-111 wordlist to perform sentiment analysis on an input text. This package can be located at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/sentiment">
https://www.npmjs.com/package/sentiment
</a>.</p><p>In order to install it, let's determine our code location:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>cd C:\Users\Owner\NodeJS_Bots_Packt\telegrambot</strong>
</pre><p>And then run this npm command:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>npm install sentiment --save  </strong>
</pre><p>You should then see something similar to this:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image00270.jpeg" alt="Building a sentiment analysis bot"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>With this, we are ready to wire up our Node.js code to use the sentiment analysis package. Let's open our Node.js code and include the following code line:</p><pre class="programlisting">var sentiment = require('sentiment'); &#13;
</pre><p>As we know, our bot has many commands, such as <code class="literal">/start</code> and <code class="literal">/help</code>; on similar lines, we have an additional command for doing sentiment analysis. This command is <code class="literal">/sentiments</code>.</p><p>The idea here is that, once you send the command <code class="literal">/sentiments</code> to our bot, the bot will confirm your intentions and will ask you to send a term or a sentence. Upon receiving a term or a sentence, the bot will carry out sentiment analysis with the help of the sentiment package that is wired up in our Node.js program. Then bot will reply with the sentiment analysis score.</p><p>Our updated <code class="literal">app.js</code> should look like this:</p><pre class="programlisting">var telegramBot = require('node-telegram-bot-api'); &#13;
var sentiment = require('sentiment'); &#13;
 &#13;
var token ='267449059:AAGzHJFlDkzOG5SxyOJJT2yHsiC06Ut6ySE'; &#13;
 &#13;
var api = new telegramBot(token, {polling: true}); &#13;
 &#13;
api.onText(/\/help/, function(msg, match) { &#13;
  var fromId = msg.from.id; &#13;
  api.sendMessage(fromId, "I can help you in getting the sentiments of any text you send to me."); &#13;
}); &#13;
 &#13;
api.onText(/\/start/, function(msg, match) { &#13;
  var fromId = msg.from.id; &#13;
  api.sendMessage(fromId, "They call me MadansFirstTelegramBot. " +  &#13;
    "I can help you in getting the sentiments of any text you send to me."+ &#13;
    "To help you i just have few commands.\n/help\n/start\n/sentiments"); &#13;
}); &#13;
 &#13;
var opts = { &#13;
  reply_markup: JSON.stringify( &#13;
    { &#13;
      force_reply: true &#13;
    } &#13;
  )}; &#13;
 &#13;
//sentiment command execution is added here &#13;
api.onText(/\/sentiments/, function(msg, match) { &#13;
  var fromId = msg.from.id;   &#13;
  api.sendMessage(fromId, "Alright! So you need sentiments of a text from me. "+ &#13;
    "I can help you in that. Just send me the text.", opts) &#13;
  .then(function (sended) { &#13;
    var chatId = sended.chat.id; &#13;
    var messageId = sended.message_id; &#13;
    api.onReplyToMessage(chatId, messageId, function (message) { &#13;
      //call a function to get sentiments here... &#13;
      var sentival = sentiment(message.text); &#13;
      api.sendMessage(fromId,"So sentiments for your text are, Score:" + sentival.score +" Comparative:"+sentival.comparative); &#13;
    }); &#13;
  });                                                    &#13;
}); &#13;
 &#13;
console.log("MadansFirstTelegramBot has started. Start conversations in your Telegram.");&#13;
</pre><p>Now let's look at the updated <code class="literal">app.js</code> code.</p><p>Firstly, we have added a reference to the sentiment package in our basic bot code as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">var sentiment = require('sentiment'); &#13;
</pre><p>We also modified the <code class="literal">/start </code>command to include the new command <code class="literal">/sentiments</code>.</p><p>Then we added the actual logic of what should happen when the <code class="literal">/sentiments</code> command is sent to the bot. Upon firing up this command, the bot will confirm the intention and will ask you to send some text, a term or a sentence using the following code line:</p><pre class="programlisting">api.sendMessage(fromId, "Alright! So you need sentiments of a text from me. "+ &#13;
  "I can help you in that. Just send me the text.", opts) &#13;
</pre><p>Once we send some text to a bot, the bot will reply to our message with the sentiment analysis of the text that has been sent. This particular logic is as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting"> api.onReplyToMessage(chatId, messageId, function (message) { &#13;
      //call a function to get sentiments here... &#13;
      var sentival = sentiment(message.text); &#13;
      api.sendMessage(fromId,"So sentiments for your text are, Score:" +   &#13;
        sentival.score +" Comparative:"+sentival.comparative); &#13;
    }); &#13;
</pre><p>In the preceding code, once the bot receives a text, a call to the <code class="literal">sentiment()</code>function is made and text is passed as <code class="literal">message.text</code> to get the sentiment.</p><p>Sentiments are returned in an object called <code class="literal">sentival</code>. This <code class="literal">sentival</code> object has both score and comparative values for the sentiment of the text that has been passed. These values are returned to the user using the following code lines:</p><pre class="programlisting">api.sendMessage(fromId,"So sentiments for your text are, Score:" + sentival.score +" Comparative:"+sentival.comparative); &#13;
</pre><p>Now let's run our Node.js program to start our conversation with the bot.</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image00271.jpeg" alt="Building a sentiment analysis bot"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>Now our updated code is running, let me also start my Telegram web version and start a conversation with my updated bot.</p><p>I have already searched for and added my bot. The screen should look like this:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image00272.jpeg" alt="Building a sentiment analysis bot"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>Click on the <strong>START</strong> button, and the <code class="literal">/start</code> command will be sent to our bot to start the conversation. Once you've done that, you'll see our bot has responded to the <code class="literal">/start</code> command. The <code class="literal">/start</code> command's response is also updated with a mention of the newly added command <code class="literal">/sentiments</code>. Refer to the following screen:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image00273.jpeg" alt="Building a sentiment analysis bot"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>Click on the <strong>/sentiments</strong> link from the response from the <code class="literal">/start</code> command. This will send a <code class="literal">/sentiments</code> command to our bot and the bot will respond as follows:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image00274.jpeg" alt="Building a sentiment analysis bot"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>So, here, the bot is asking the user to send text as a message; in response to that, the bot will share the sentiment of the message sent by the user. Now let's write the message <code class="literal">Bots are awesome!</code> in <strong>Write a message...</strong>, and hit enter or click <strong>SEND</strong>. Do not close the message from the bot, which is shown as a small popup with a close button.</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image00275.jpeg" alt="Building a sentiment analysis bot"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>Immediately, the bot will respond with the score and the comparative value for the sentiment of your text, as follows:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image00276.jpeg" alt="Building a sentiment analysis bot"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>So, we entered the text <code class="literal">Bots are awesome!</code> and, in response to that, the bot sent us a sentiment <strong>Score:4 </strong>and<strong> Comparative:1.33</strong>. For the text sent to the bot, with the score value coming in as positive, the bot is showing us a positive opinion.</p><p>Now to get the sentiment for a new term, again send a <code class="literal">/sentiments</code> command to our bot.</p><p>The bot will again confirm the intentions, and will ask us to share some text. Now let's send the text <code class="literal">The food was very bad.</code> and see what bot returns.</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image00277.jpeg" alt="Building a sentiment analysis bot"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>We entered the text <code class="literal">The food was very bad</code>. In response to that, the bot sent us a sentiment with <strong>Score:-3</strong> and <strong>Comparative:-0.6</strong>. This way, the bot is showing us a negative opinion here from the text.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec31"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>We have had an interesting journey learning how to build a Telegram bot and how we can have a great conversational experience with the intelligence built in to it.</p><p>To summarize, we have seen how to create a Telegram account if you are new to Telegram. Further to that, we have also used an interesting way to create our own bot, using BotFather. BotFather is a Telegram bot that rules all the other Telegram bots.</p><p>After creating our bot, we wired it in to the Node.js program using the npm package and built some basic intelligence for our bot chat.</p><p>Finally, we wanted our bot to provide sentiment analysis, so we looked at the very basics of sentiment analysis. To carry out sentiment analysis, we used the npm package for sentiment analysis and enriched our basic bot to provide us with sentiment analysis. Our bot is mainly of the type that needs a chat session opening and then leverages the bot functionalities by sending it commands. There is also another Telegram bot type, which is the inline bot. Exploring Telegram inline bots further is left with the reader.</p><p>Hopefully, this chapter has given you some insight on Telegram bots, and how we can enhance them using Node.js and Telegram bot APIs to provide an enhanced conversational experience within Telegram. In the next chapter, we will explore how to build a Slack bot. For those who do not know Slack, Slack is simply a real-time messaging app specifically for team collaboration. We will actually be building a bot for Slack, which will help us to locate documents in the document repository based on the user's request.</p><p>Keep exploring further.</p></div></body></html>
