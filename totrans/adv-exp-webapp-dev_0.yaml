- en: Building an Express application that is reliable, robust, maintainable, testable,
    and can scale beyond a single server requires a bit of extra thought and effort.
    Express applications that need to survive in a production environment will need
    to reach out to the *Node* ecosystem and beyond for support. *Advanced Express
    Web Application Development* aims to deliver a working real-world, single-page
    application that can meet these goals and allow us the opportunity to explore
    the more advanced features of Express.

- en: If you are an experienced JavaScript developer who wants to build highly scalable,
    real-world applications using Express, this book is ideal for you. This book is
    an advanced title and assumes that the reader has some experience with Node.js,
    JavaScript MVC web development frameworks, and has at least heard of Express before.
    The reader should also have a basic understanding of Redis and MongoDB. This book
    is not a tutorial on node but aims to explore some of the more advanced topics
    you will encounter when developing, deploying, and maintaining an Express web
    application.
