- en: Knockout is built around a pattern that started in Microsoft. This model is
    Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM), and I think introducing this pattern to newcomers
    is one of the biggest obstacles to wider adoption. Nearly every other JavaScript
    library or framework, along with most server-side frameworks, has been built around
    the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, and the differences between the two are
    sometimes confusing, even for experienced developers. This problem is compounded
    by the fact that some larger frameworks, such as AngularJS, end up with a pattern
    that is nearly identical to MVVM.

- en: Knockout's documentation is excellent, and its live examples and interactive
    tutorials are some of the best. When it comes to organizing full applications,
    though, more explanation is required. When I started writing this book, there
    was only one book on Knockout on Amazon, and it didn't have very favorable reviews.
    It seemed like a complete guide to using Knockout as the central piece of a frontend
    stack was missing.

- en: I have been using Knockout for 3 years now, and I've been an active member of
    the community on StackOverflow and GitHub for 2 years. I've used Knockout in several
    professional applications as well as a dozen or so personal projects. It is, by
    far, my favorite JavaScript library, and I strongly prefer MVVM over MVC for developing
    client applications. Hopefully, you feel that this book gives you everything you
    need in order to be successful with Knockout.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Knockout 3.2 was released while this book was being written. [Chapter 4](part0037_split_000.html#page
    "Chapter 4. Application Development with Components and Modules"), *Application
    Development with Components and Modules*, was rewritten to include the components
    feature, and some minor changes were made to other chapters in order to make them
    accurate. However, most of the code samples were written against Knockout 3.1,
    and so they do not take advantage of pure computed observables or other features
    that were released in Knockout 3.2.
