When they worked, they were fantastic; when they didn't, it was a nightmare. Especially frustrating was the clear fact that there weren't any bugs in the JavaScript code driving the application. No, the problem was that often there was too much code running, perhaps because it was processing a large data set. The end result was always the same: the UI would freeze, and I would helplessly curse the Web.</p><p>Nowadays, this doesn't happen as frequently. We've fixed many of the common JavaScript problems from years ago. Something that hasn't caught on as fast as I had hoped is concurrency in JavaScript. There are little bits of concurrency sprinkled all throughout our applications, but seldom do we see truly concurrent JavaScript code.</p><p>Let's change the status quo.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
