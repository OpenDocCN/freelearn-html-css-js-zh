    through the fascinating intersection of one of the most popular programming languages
    and the ever-evolving world of microservices architecture. JavaScript, with its
    versatility and ubiquity, combined with the modular, scalable power of microservices,
    forms the perfect duo for modern software development. This book is designed to
    bridge these two worlds, offering a comprehensive guide to building, managing,
    and scaling microservices with JavaScript.

    architecture. Gone are the days when monolithic applications dominated the landscape,
    offering simplicity but at the cost of scalability and flexibility. Microservices,
    with their promise of independent, self-contained units, have brought about a
    new era of development: agile, resilient, and highly scalable. However, with great
    power comes great responsibility, and the challenges of adopting a microservices
    architecture should not be underestimated.'
