Aptana Studio is a powerful open source integrated development environment (IDE) that specializes in building web applicati ons. Aptana Studio has been around since 2008. It provides language support for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, Rails, PHP, Python, and many others, by using plugins. Since Version 3.0.4, the developer team of Aptana Studio has integrated the latest HTML5 and CSS3 specifi cati ons. This allows the capabiliti es of most modern browsers to be uti lized for the development of Aptana Studio. The latest Version has been downloaded more than 6 million ti mes.
</p><p>Aptana Studio ships with other tasks, such as FTP and Git integration, JavaScript libraries, and JavaScript debugging. Furthermore, the Aptana Jaxer web server is included, which specializes in working with AJAX applications and websites.</p><p>Aptana Studio builds on the Java platform Eclipse, therefore it is a cross platform software and works on common operating systems, such as Linux, Mac OS-X, and Windows.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip01"/>Tip</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>What is Eclipse SDK?</strong></span>
</p><p>The Eclipse software development kit (SDK) is an open source project that is completely written in Java and was started by the IBM company in 2001.</p></div></div><p>It is possible to install Aptana either as an Eclipse plugin or as a standalone version because Aptana Studio builds on Eclipse.
