<p class="mce-root">In this chapter, we will be taking a look at debugging. Debugging is a very important aspect of creating working ServiceNow scripts. We will be taking a look at the script and session debugger, and how these are both used. We will then look at field watchers, debugging applications, the JavaScript log, and debug window. Finally, we will see how to debug REST and SOAP messages in a ServiceNow instance.</p>

<p>The script debugger allows developers to debug server-side script to discover errors or issues with their code. We had a brief look at the script debugger in <a href="170b38f0-5b60-4c8d-aef3-6833efee13f1.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Introduction to Server-Side Scripting</em>.</p>
<p>To recap, we can set breakpoints in the server-side script we have written to debug the script when it is run by using the script debugger. This is the only way we can use breakpoints in ServiceNow to step through and into our script.</p>
<p>To use the script debugger, we first need to set a breakpoint in one of our server-side scripts. This can be any script you want to step through, either a system script or one you have built yourself. A good example is the <kbd>incident_events</kbd> business rule, as we can also see how different events are triggered from the incident form, too.</p>
<p>To start, we add a breakpoint in the <kbd>incident_events</kbd> business rule, as seen in <em>Figure 9.1</em>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/2abc56f5-f4f5-4068-ad46-0c6f43453cbe.png"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Figure 9.1: Business rule incident_events with break point added</div>
<p>To set this breakpoint, we simply click in the margin of the code to make the breakpoint appear, as shown by the arrow. To remove it, we simply click on the blue arrow, and the breakpoint is removed. Once the breakpoint is set, we can open the script debugger.</p>
<p>To open the script debugger, we can navigate to <span class="packt_screen">System Diagnostics</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Script Debugger</span>. This opens the script debugger in a separate window. We can also open the script debugger from any script type field. We need to click on the script debugger icon that looks like a small insect with a scroll to open the script debugger from this type of field.</p>
<p>We can see this icon highlighted in <em>Figure 9.2</em>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-475 image-border" src="assets/4d8e9a9c-b30f-4d11-a7fa-8ac432ce3482.png" style="width:70.17em;height:21.50em;"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Figure 9.2: Script type field showing the script debugger</div>
<p class="mce-root">We can now run the <kbd>incident_events</kbd> script by updating any existing incident, and when we see the window shown in <em>Figure 9.3</em>, we click <span class="packt_screen">Start Debugging</span> to look at the script stopped at our breakpoint:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-476 image-border" src="assets/bd6f4c74-977f-4415-87d3-481fdd05e72d.png" style="width:21.83em;height:12.17em;"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Figure 9.3: Script debugger popup window</div>
<p>Now that we are into the process of debugging, we can switch to the debugging window. From here, we have some fairly standard debugging options that can be seen in the upper right-hand corner of the screen.</p>
<p>We can see these in <em>Figure 9.4</em>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/a31d1f85-df36-4846-a1d5-c01086d6beb2.png"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Figure 9.4: Script debugging options</div>
<p>The options we have for debugging are, from left to right:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pause debugging</strong>: The pausing debugger turns the debugger off. This changes the icon to a power icon, but by clicking this changed icon, we can turn the debugger back on again.</li>
<li><strong>Resume script execution</strong>: This will resume the script from after the current breakpoint until the next breakpoint, or until the script is complete.</li>
<li><strong>Step over next function call</strong>: This button allows you to step through the code and over any function calls, which means skipping over them.</li>
<li><strong>Step into next function call</strong>: Clicking this icon steps through the script and into any function called in the code.</li>
<li><strong>Step out of current function</strong>: This will step through the current script, but out of any function that the code is currently in.</li>
</ul>
<p>These buttons allow you to move through the code you have written from the start point of a breakpoint and find where any issues may lie.</p>
<p>This type of debugging is quite typical in a lot of software debugging, with options to pause, resume, and step in, out, and over functions. If this is new to you, however, spend some time familiarizing yourself with these buttons, as it can save you time when debugging longer scripts.</p>
<p>Let's have a look at what the full window looks like in <em>Figure 9.5</em>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/fa0652c0-fd91-4bcc-918d-c1b7251c2219.png" style="width:62.75em;height:33.58em;"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Figure 9.5: Script debugging window</div>
<p>This debugging method is very helpful and something that was missing from earlier versions of ServiceNow. With the script debugger, we have a much more rounded debugging experience.</p>
<p>Adding breakpoints in scripts and being able to step through them adds an extra level of debugging, beyond just logging outputs.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">The session debugger</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The session debugger allows you to debug certain aspects of the ServiceNow platform during the ServiceNow session. You are also able to turn on or off all session debugging. Session debugging will give you a lot of information, but it can sometimes be information overload, so it can be worth picking individual aspects you want to specifically debug. I often find the security debug to be the most useful.</p>
<p>Session debugging is found in system diagnostics and contains a number of modules. You can enable any of the session debugging areas by clicking the module you would like session debugging turned on for. You can also turn on all debugging by selecting <span class="packt_screen">Enable All</span>. You cannot turn off individual debugging areas, though, except for UI policies, and debugging is disabled by clicking <span class="packt_screen">Disable All</span> or when the session ends, as well.</p>
<p>We can see the session debug modules in <em>Figure 9.6</em>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/9aa0c183-63de-4301-807b-9a5df79f12f4.png" style="width:14.33em;height:43.25em;"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Figure 9.6: Session debugging modules</div>
<p>The session debug information appears on each page that you load when information on debugging has been requested, normally at the bottom of the loaded page.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that it may be that you have to scroll quite far down to see the information provided to you, especially on bigger forms or lists.</p>
<p>A lot of information can be displayed, which can make this method of debugging a little generic, and weaker than a more targeted debugging approach. However, this method of debugging can give information to you that is difficult to find elsewhere in the platform.</p>
<p>Let's have a look at some example session debug output. </p>
<p>First, we will take a look at security. Security in ServiceNow can be a tricky issue to solve if the relevant access is not appearing for the users you are logging in as. </p>
<p>Because is it possible to have multiple access controls for each type of access in ServiceNow, it can be difficult to find the exact rule that is causing issues.</p>
<p>Using session debug, we can see which access controls allowed access and which ones denied it. This can be very helpful in working out whether the access control we are looking at is incorrect and needs to be altered, or if there is an access control we were not aware of that is causing access issues for us.</p>
<p>In <em>Figure 9.7</em>, we can see some session debug output for security on the incident form:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-477 image-border" src="assets/0da264dd-55c2-47ac-8108-1452730aa092.png" style="width:91.67em;height:58.92em;"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Figure 9.7:  Security session debug output</div>
<p>Here, we can see where security rules for the incident form were checked when the incident form was loaded. As you can see, there is a lot of information provided, and this example is only a small section of the session debug information provided for loading an incident form. </p>
<p>The green ticks indicate that the checks against security rules were successful. At the bottom of the example, there are some larger blocks of checks which relate to a specific security check taking place. We can see after <span class="packt_screen">PATH =</span> the check that is being performed, so, for the bottom check we are looking at <span class="packt_screen">record/incident.subcategory/read</span>, which means we are seeing whether the logged-in user can read the subcategory field on the incident record. In this case, it is successful, so the field is displayed to the user.</p>
<p>Now, let's see some business rule session debugging.</p>
<p>In <em>Figure 9.8</em>, we can see an example of business rule debugging on the incident form:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-478 image-border" src="assets/629927e1-9428-4417-b5ad-98bb243a7bb4.png" style="width:103.42em;height:64.50em;"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Figure 9.8: Business rule session debugging</div>
<p>In this example section of the business rule session debug script, we can see timestamps for business rule execution and where business rules start and end. The timestamps are to a one thousandth of a second so that the execution order is easier to determine.</p>
<p>Where you can see a <span class="packt_screen">==&gt;</span>, a business rule execution is starting, and a <span class="packt_screen">&lt;==</span> indicates the business rule completing. We can also see, in this example, where business rules are skipped due to the business rule condition not being matched, which can be helpful.</p>
<p>Again, the preceding is just a sample of the information given during a load of the incident form with business rule session debugging switched on, so there is quite a lot of data to search through to find what you might be looking for.</p>
<p>Finally, we will take a look at a log session debug.</p>
<p>We can see an example of a log session debug in <em>Figure 9.9</em>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/cb1d8dbb-57f3-4e22-8336-a061842f00a4.png"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Figure 9.9: Log session debugging sample</div>
<p>The logs will give you logs relating to the opening of the record; in our example, opening the incident form. I do not tend to use this session debugs as much as others, but it can help to track whether any important logs that can lead to information on potential issues <span>occur when records are opened</span>.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">The Field Watcher</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Field Watcher</span> debugging functionality allows you to watch an individual field and monitor any changes that occur to that field. You can only watch one field at a time using the Field Watcher. If there is a particular field you can see changing, but are not sure what is modifying the value, this can be a helpful tool to use.</p>
<p>To watch a field, right-click on the field in the form view, and at the bottom of the context menu, you should see an option to watch the field. Once this has been selected, a small bug icon appears to show that the field is being watched, and a Field Watcher window appears from the bottom of the frame.</p>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Field Watcher</span> frame shows any changes to the field, and using tick boxes in the <span class="packt_screen">Field Watcher</span> window, you can switch which type of changes the Field Watcher will check for, for example, business rule, client script, and so on.</p>
<p>A good example to show the Field Watcher in action is to watch the priority field on an incident. If you then change the impact or urgency on the form, you will see the Field Watcher catching the change in the value of the priority field. We can see this in <em>Figure 9.10</em>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/6ad38f6a-c024-4e5f-b39e-01d2808f4aeb.png"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Figure 9.10: Field watcher showing change to priority field</div>
<p>In the preceding figure, we can see that because the <span class="packt_screen">Impact</span> field was changed to <span class="packt_screen">1 - High,</span> the <span class="packt_screen">Priority</span> changed from <span class="packt_screen">5 - Planning</span> to <span class="packt_screen">3 - Moderate</span>. This was captured in the Field Watcher and the client script that ran as a result of this change to the field.</p>
<p>The Field Watcher can be a useful tool if you know exactly which field you are interested in and want to know why the value is changing.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Debugging applications</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>When debugging applications, we are often interested in the scope at given times while our code is running. Some of the tools given to debug applications are actually session debugging modules. We saw the modules, ServiceNow classes as application debugging, along with others, in the session debugging section. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Debug business rules</li>
<li>Debug business rules (details)</li>
<li>Debug security</li>
<li>Debug scopes</li>
</ul>
<p>Business rules and security can be useful whether we are in an application or not, but the scope is very important for application coding. To show how debugging the scope works, we can create a test application, and a business rule for that application, in the application scope.</p>
<p>Once the application and the business rule have been created, we need to click the debug scopes and debug business rules modules in the session debugging. As an example, we can see this when updating an incident in the session debug logging.</p>
<p>We can see this in <em>Figure 9.11</em>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/28aabe26-3154-453d-86a8-be23af433f46.png"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Figure 9.11: Session debugging for scopes and business rules</div>
<p>We can see in the logging that, as we enter the business rule from our test application, we also enter the scope of our test application. Once the business rule has completed executing, we revert back to the global scope.</p>
<p>As we saw in <a href="170b38f0-5b60-4c8d-aef3-6833efee13f1.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Introduction to Server-Side Scripting</em>, when we debug using GlideSystem in an application, we need to remember that <kbd>gs.log</kbd> will not work. For debugging in an application, we need to use four scoped application logging levels.</p>
<p>To recap, these scoped application logging levels are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Error</li>
<li>Warn</li>
<li>Info</li>
<li>Debug</li>
</ul>
<p>These logging levels and their levels of verbosity are helpful to log messages to the system logs when checking values during a script.</p>
<p>We can also enable session debugging for a particular application. This can be enabled from the application page for the related links. Scripts from the application will generate logs to the system log if they use the GlideSystem logging method.</p>
<p>We can see this in <em>Figure 9.12</em>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/3f091ae5-ea00-47b0-ab14-aaa7c3ac0e7f.png" style="width:21.42em;height:10.25em;"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Figure 9.12: Application related links</div>
<p>To enable session debugging, the <span class="packt_screen">Related Links</span> needs to be clicked. The related link will change and show as <span class="packt_screen">disable session debug</span> while the debugging is active. It can be selected again to disable session debugging.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">The JavaScript Log and Debug window</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The JavaScript <span>L</span>og window is a further way that logs can be viewed in the ServiceNow platform. Rather than using the GlideSystem logging methods, this method allows you to define a different type of log to send to a window that appears at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>To see the JavaScript <span>L</span>og window, you can go to the system settings of the instance you are working on. Once displayed, select the <span class="packt_screen">Developer</span> option. From here, set the <span class="packt_screen">JavaScript Log and Field Watcher</span> attribute to show the JavaScript Log window. </p>
<p>We can see the attribute set in <em>Figure 9.13</em>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-479 image-border" src="assets/769ba908-1dff-43d6-bdbf-f6470f13084e.png" style="width:93.00em;height:44.00em;"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Figure 9.13: Developer system settings showing the JavaScript log and Field Watcher option</div>
<p>Once the <span class="packt_screen">JavaScript Log and Field Watcher</span> attribute has been set, you will see a window appear at the bottom of the screen. This is the same window that appears to show a watched field, but this time, the tab set will be JavaScript Log.</p>
<p>We can see the window that appears in <em>Figure 9.14</em>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-480 image-border" src="assets/68eafea7-ea7a-45a2-944a-6f4ded983d8d.png" style="width:130.25em;height:10.08em;"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Figure 9.14: JavaScript Log window</div>
<p>This example of the JavaScript window shows no logs, and the window can be cleared from all logging by clicking the circle with a line through it, towards the right-hand side of the header bar.</p>
<p>We can also change the size of the window by clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">Small</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Medium</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Large</span> buttons in the header bar. The down arrow button in the far-right corner closes the window down.</p>
<p>Logs in the JavaScript Log window are added to the bottom of the list of current logs <span>while the window is open</span>. Logs are timestamped so that you can see which order the logs were added in. This can be especially helpful when looking to see what order client scripts ran in when opening a form in the platform.</p>
<p>To log to the JavaScript Log window, we use <kbd>jslog()</kbd>, which is a global function. This works in a very similar way to <kbd>gs.log</kbd>. We can see an example of how to use <kbd>jslog</kbd> in the following code:</p>
<pre>jslog('Testing writing to the JavaScript log');</pre>
<p>If we add the preceding code to an incident <kbd>onLoad</kbd> client script, we can see the log in the JavaScript Log window.</p>
<p>We can see this in <em>Figure 9.15</em>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/e2d72fcd-8c93-4cd2-b7ee-a0ec556d31de.png"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Figure 9.15: JavaScript Log with sample log</div>
<p>This method of debugging can be helpful as an alternative to using GlideSystem logs. Some mature instances will sometimes have so many system logs per second, it can be difficult to debug, so this JavaScript Log window can be helpful in this case.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Debugging REST</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>REST messages are very helpful for integrating between ServiceNow instances and with third-party software. When debugging your ServiceNow instance, you may also need to see logging for REST messages.</p>
<p><span>To debug REST messages, we need to set the system property <kbd>glide.rest.debug</kbd> found in the system properties table (<span class="packt_screen">sys_properties</span>) to <kbd>true</kbd>. This property may well need to be created, as it is not included in the baseline system. </span></p>
<p><span>Let's have a look at an example of this system property:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-481 image-border" src="assets/947eb808-4ab9-4b6c-a3b3-b0ff9796903d.png" style="width:106.92em;height:48.58em;"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Figure 9.16: System property glide.rest.debug</div>
<p>In the example, we can see our created system property. The <span class="packt_screen">Name</span> needs to be <kbd>glide.rest.debug</kbd> and the <span class="packt_screen">Value</span> set to <kbd>true</kbd>. It is also good practice to write a good description with any system property you create, to assist other administrators.</p>
<p>Once this property is set to <kbd>true</kbd>, when activating the session debugging debug log we saw earlier on in the chapter, REST message logs will also be added to the log that is output. Once this type of debugging has been completed, this property should be set to <kbd>false</kbd> to avoid using up system resources.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">SOAP debugging</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>In a way similar to REST messages, SOAP messages are very important when integrating with other systems. It can be necessary to find out when messages have been received and what exact message came into the instance.</p>
<p>To debug SOAP messages, we need to add a system property, or amend it if it was previously added. The system property that needs to be added is <kbd>glide.processor.debug.SOAPProcessor</kbd> and the <span class="packt_screen">Value</span> needs to be set to <kbd>true</kbd>.</p>
<p>Let's see a completed example of this system property:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-482 image-border" src="assets/61def292-0be4-455e-8823-d62bfc8baff8.png" style="width:106.58em;height:48.33em;"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Figure 9.17: System property glide.processor.debug.SOAPProcessor</div>
<p>The example shows the system property that needs to be created for debugging SOAP envelopes. The name must be exact, and the value set to <kbd>true</kbd>. A good description will also help others looking through the system properties to explain its function.</p>
<p>Once this property is set, we will start to see an incoming SOAP envelope XML in the system logs. This is very helpful to see what was received by the instance when messages are received. </p>
<p>Once debugging has been completed, this system property should be set to <kbd>false</kbd> to stop excessive logging in the instance. This also stops resources from being used to provide these logs when they are no longer being monitored.</p>

<p>The focus of this chapter was debugging. We looked at the various tools ServiceNow gives us to debug our code and the methods we can use to make the most of them. We looked at the script debugger and making breakpoints, the session debugging modules, and debugging applications. We also took a look at the JavaScript Log and Field Watcher window, and how this can aid us in our debugging.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will explore ServiceNow best practices. This includes best practices when writing and debugging script on the client and server side. We will also investigate how this affects system performance and how we can streamline our code to make the best use of instance resources.</p>
