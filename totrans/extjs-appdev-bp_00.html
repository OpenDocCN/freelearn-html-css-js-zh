Slowly but surely, as browsers implemented faster JavaScript engines and new features and as developers and engineers came up with new techniques and ideas, JavaScript became near-ubiquitous in providing the functionality that end users have come to expect. With Ext JS, you have a toolset that allows you to build advanced JavaScript applications, but with great power comes great responsibility.</p><p>An application architect is the guiding hand of a project. They help to ensure that client expectations are met, timescales are achieved, and costs are contained. While juggling these requirements, the architect must provide the foundations for a technically successful project consisting of high quality, understandable code.</p><p>In <span class="emphasis"><em>Ext JS Application Development Blueprints</em></span>, we'll go through the theory and practice of designing and building Ext JS applications. Over the next 11 chapters, you'll learn how Ext JS gives developers the key to a professionally designed software project and how to take this knowledge and use it in a range of real-world scenarios.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

<div class="section" title="Conventions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "This should be familiar to a seasoned Ext JS developer: we use <code class="literal">Ext.define</code> to create a class called <code class="literal">MyApp.SessionManager</code>."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">Ext.define('MyApp.SessionManager', {
   login: function(username, password) {
          User.login(username, password, {
                success: Ext.bind(this.loginSuccess, this)
          });
},

loginSuccess: function() {
         this.isLoggedIn = true;
