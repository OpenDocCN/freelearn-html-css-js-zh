- en: Welcome to *D3.js Quick Start Guide*. In it, we'll be covering the basics of
    D3 through a series of large builds. By the end, you should have a strong enough
    grasp of the library to go out and build your own interactive data visualizations.

    D3.js*, provides a high-level overview of what makes D3 so interesting. We examine
    what an SVG element is and set up our machine so that it is ready to create D3
    code. We also take a look at this book''s approach to learning and how it applies
    to the applications that we''ll build.'

    Images Using Code*, covers the basics of SVG (base tags, basic elements, positioning,
    and styling). We also look at Bezier curves and how to draw organic shapes with
    them. We''re now ready to learn how D3 can be used to modify these elements.'

    Using a Data File*, covers many interesting use cases that any system administrator
    will need to run daily. Many other tasks can be performed as we show with customized
    playbooks. But not every script is considered as good automation. What matters
    is that the right nodes go from state A to state B with no errors and in a short
    time.'

    relationships between various nodes of data. This can be very useful in scenarios
    such as graphing a friend network, showing parent/child company relationships,
    or displaying a company''s staff hierarchy.'
