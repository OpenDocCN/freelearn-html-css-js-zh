Hopefully, by now you have already thought of an idea for a bot that will not just make your own life easier but may also be useful for others. In this chapter, you will learn how to make your bot accessible to users outside of your own team and across the Slack community.</p><p>We will cover the steps necessary to add your bot to the Slack app directory and to make it accessible to others. We will review the following steps to add your bot onto the Slack app directory:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Registering your bot and obtaining tokens</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Understanding the OAuth process</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Configuring the <strong>Add to Slack</strong> button</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Scopes</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Submitting your app or bot to the app directory</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Monetizing your bot</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec31"/>The Slack app directory</h1></div></div></div><p>In order to make <a class="indexterm" id="id297"/>adding apps easy for their users, Slack has created the app directory (<a class="ulink" href="https://slack.com/apps">https://slack.com/apps</a>). This is a place to shop for apps and bots to add to your <a class="indexterm" id="id298"/>Slack team. Like other app stores available, every app submitted <a class="indexterm" id="id299"/>to the app directory is controlled and has to be approved by Slack itself to counteract spam and abuse.</p><p>It is possible for other teams to use your bot by means of webhooks, as we saw in the previous chapter. However, if you are trying to reach a wide audience and potentially monetize your bot, the app directory is the most efficient way.</p><div><img alt="The Slack app directory" src="img/B05384_07_01.jpg"/><div><p>The app directory makes adding new apps easy</p></div></div><p>The end goal of this chapter is to allow users to add a bot to their Slack team by clicking an <strong>Add to Slack</strong> button, which we will cover in detail later.</p><p>Let's start by registering an <a class="indexterm" id="id300"/>app. In this example, we will add the <em>Wikibot</em> bot, which we <a class="indexterm" id="id301"/>built in <a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Adding Complexity">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Adding Complexity</em>.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note35"/>Note</h3><p>Please note that our registering of Wikibot (and the use of the Wikipedia API) is for demonstrative purposes only. Always check the terms and conditions of a third-party API before using it for a bot you intend to publish. In the case of Wikibot, for example, we can use the Wikipedia API but aren't allowed to publish a bot named <a class="indexterm" id="id302"/>
<code class="literal">Wikipedia bot</code>, as we do not own the <a class="indexterm" id="id303"/>trademark.</p></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec32"/>Registering your app and obtaining tokens</h1></div></div></div><p>Certain unique <a class="indexterm" id="id304"/>tokens are required in order to successfully authenticate with <a class="indexterm" id="id305"/>Slack's OAuth servers. This is necessary so that Slack can determine whether we are who we say we are and whether our app or bot is actually integrated with the team we are attempting to get access to.</p><p>We start by navigating <a class="indexterm" id="id306"/>to the Slack new app registration page at <a class="ulink" href="https://api.slack.com/applications/new">https://api.slack.com/applications/new</a>. Fill out the form by picking a name for your bot, the team it originated from, descriptions of your bot, links to help pages, and a redirect URI:</p><div><img alt="Registering your app and obtaining tokens" src="img/B05384_07_02.jpg"/><div><p>Be as descriptive as you can when filling out this form</p></div></div><p>After saving your <a class="indexterm" id="id307"/>settings, you can choose to set up a bot user, webhook, or slash <a class="indexterm" id="id308"/>command. For Wikibot, we will be setting up a bot user.</p><div><img alt="Registering your app and obtaining tokens" src="img/B05384_07_03.jpg"/><div><p>If your specified username is taken, Slack will edit it slightly to avoid conflicts</p></div></div><p>Once you've saved <a class="indexterm" id="id309"/>your changes, you should be presented with OAuth information on the <a class="indexterm" id="id310"/>next screen. First, make sure to save the <strong>Client ID</strong> and <strong>Client Secret</strong> codes from this page before moving on:</p><div><img alt="Registering your app and obtaining tokens" src="img/B05384_07_04.jpg"/><div><p>Never share your client secret with anyone</p></div></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note36"/>Note</h3><p>This process does not make your bot visible to the entire Slack user base; it simply registers your intent to develop an app. You will be able to test your app through the <a class="indexterm" id="id311"/>OAuth process. We will cover how to submit your bot to the <a class="indexterm" id="id312"/>app directory in a later section.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec33"/>Understanding the OAuth process</h1></div></div></div><p>In order to <a class="indexterm" id="id313"/>implement a bot user in a team that is not our own, we require a bot token similar to the ones we created earlier for our own team. We can request this token, but first we must prove that we are who we say we are using the OAuth process. <strong>OAuth</strong> (<strong>Open Authentication</strong>) is an open standard for authentication used by many companies, large and small.</p><p>The authentication process works through the following steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">The user clicks the <strong>Add to Slack</strong> button.</li><li class="listitem">Slack sends a request to the redirect URI provided in our app's settings page.</li><li class="listitem">Once the request is received <a class="indexterm" id="id314"/>on our server, we redirect it to the authorization API endpoint (<a class="ulink" href="https://slack.com/oauth/authorize">https://slack.com/oauth/authorize</a>) and include the following parameters in the query string:<div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">client_id</code>: This is the unique ID given to us when we first created our app.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">scope</code>: This includes the permissions we require for our app. We will go into more detail on scopes later in this chapter.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">redirect_uri</code>: This is an optional parameter. This is the URI that Slack will send the authorization results to. If left blank, the <code class="literal">redirect_uri</code> specified in the app settings page is used.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">State</code>: This is a string we create; it could contain data we wish to preserve or function as our own identification method. For example, we could populate this field with a secret phrase that only we know, which we can later use to ensure that this request came from a trusted source.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">Team</code>: This is the Slack team ID we wish to restrict our application to. This is useful when debugging our integration.</li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem">Slack sends a HTTP GET request to the redirect URI provided in our previous request. If absent, it defaults to the URI we provided in our app's settings page. The request contains the following parameters:<div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">code</code>: This is a temporary code generated by Slack, and it is used to confirm our identity</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">state</code>: This is the string we created earlier, and it can be used to make sure this request is legitimate</li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem">Armed with all the tools and codes we need, we make a request for a bot user token from Slack in another HTTP GET request, passing the following parameters:<div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">client_id</code>: This is the unique client ID given to us in the app's settings page</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">client_secret</code>: This is the unique and secret ID given to us in the app's settings page</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">code</code>: This is the code given to us by the request in step 4</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">redirect_uri</code>: This must match the previous <code class="literal">redirect_</code>uri if one was sent; otherwise, it is optional</li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem">Finally, if <a class="indexterm" id="id315"/>all went well, we will receive a response from Slack with all the data we require. It should look something like this:<div><pre class="programlisting">{

In order to make our lives a bit easier, we will use the Express <a class="indexterm" id="id316"/>web framework (<a class="ulink" href="http://expressjs.com/">http://expressjs.com/</a>) and the familiar <code class="literal">superagent</code> AJAX library. Make sure to install both by using the following command:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">

Run the Node application after making sure that your <code class="literal">client_id</code>, <code class="literal">client_secret</code>, and <code class="literal">redirect_uri</code> are inserted in the highlighted sections of the preceding code. To test the integration, navigate to the <a class="indexterm" id="id321"/>documentation on the <strong>Add to Slack</strong> button here: <a class="ulink" href="https://api.slack.com/docs/slack-button#button-widget">https://api.slack.com/docs/slack-button#button-widget</a>.

<strong>You have successfully installed Wikibot! You can now start using it in your Slack team, but make sure to invite the bot to your channel first with the /invite command!</strong>
</p><p>We returned <a class="indexterm" id="id322"/>a simple string in this example. As per best practices, we need to redirect to a web page with some instructions on how to operate Wikibot.</p><p>Switch to the Slack client and to the channel you'd like to incorporate Wikibot. As we discussed in <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Your First Bot">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Your First Bot</em>, bot users have to be manually invited to a channel, so let's do that and test our bot:</p><div><img alt="Understanding the OAuth process" src="img/B05384_07_08.jpg"/><div><p>Our bot is successfully integrated and working!</p></div></div><p>Wikibot <a class="indexterm" id="id323"/>will now continue to function as long as our Node service is running.</p><p>Next, we will look at the other scopes available for our use.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec34"/>Scopes</h1></div></div></div><p>OAuth scopes allow <a class="indexterm" id="id324"/>you to specify exactly what access your app needs to perform its functions. In the previous example, we requested the <code class="literal">bot</code> scope, which gives our bots access to all the actions a bot user can perform. For example, the <code class="literal">channels:history</code> scope gives us access to the channel's chat history and <code class="literal">users:read</code> allows us to access the full list of users in the team. There is a long list of <a class="indexterm" id="id325"/>scopes available (which you can review at <a class="ulink" href="https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-scopes">https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-scopes</a>), but we will focus on the three most likely to be used scopes in our apps:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">bot</code>: This provides a bot token, allowing us to connect to the team as a bot user</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">incoming-webhook</code>: This provides an incoming webhook token</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">commands</code>: This provides a Slack token, which we can use to ensure that the incoming slash command requests are valid</li></ul></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note38"/>Note</h3><p>Scopes of the bot variety automatically include a subset of other scopes needed for the bot to perform. For more information, visit <a class="ulink" href="https://api.slack.com/bot-users#bot-methods">https://api.slack.com/bot-users#bot-methods</a>.</p></div></div><p>Multiple scopes can be requested without issue. Here's an example of the bot, incoming webhook and command scopes being requested in our initial redirect:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">app.get('/', (req, res) =&gt; {
  res.redirect(`https://slack.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=${CLIENT_ID}&amp;scope=bot+incoming-webhook+commands&amp;redirect_uri=${escape('http://YOUR_REDIRECT_URI/bot')}`);
});</pre></div><p>Note how the <a class="indexterm" id="id326"/>requested scopes are separated with a <code class="literal">+</code> symbol. This will return the following object after we authenticate:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">{ 
  ok: true,
  access_token: 'xoxp-xxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx',
  scope: 'identify,bot,commands,incoming-webhook',
  user_id: 'Uxxxxxxxx',

  team_id: 'Txxxxxxxx',
  incoming_webhook:

  bot:

     bot_user_id: 'Uxxxxxxxx',
     bot_access_token: 'xoxb-xxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'        
   }
}</pre></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note39"/>Note</h3><p>Instead of using the <code class="literal">+</code> symbol, scopes can also be comma separated.</p></div></div><p>We now have all the pieces we need to create a bot (the <code class="literal">bot_access</code>_token), an incoming webhook (the <code class="literal">url</code> parameter in the <code class="literal">incoming_webhook</code> object), and the <code class="literal">access_token</code> we use for slash commands.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec35"/>Submitting your app to the app directory</h1></div></div></div><p>Once you have <a class="indexterm" id="id327"/>tested your integration within your team's <a class="indexterm" id="id328"/>channel, and you are happy with your bot, it's time to submit it to the app directory. To do so, first ensure that your application conforms to Slack's checklist for <a class="indexterm" id="id329"/>deploying an app (<a class="ulink" href="https://api.slack.com/docs/slack-apps-checklist">https://api.slack.com/docs/slack-apps-checklist</a>). In short, your app must:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Request only those scopes that are actually in use.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Display the <strong>Add to Slack</strong> button on a webpage. You are required to have your own website with instructions and help for new users.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Have an appropriate name (for example, no trademark or copyright infringement).</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Have an app or bot icon that is clear and distinctive.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Have a high-quality icon that is at least 512 x 512 pixels in size.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Include short and <a class="indexterm" id="id330"/>long descriptions of your bot's <a class="indexterm" id="id331"/>actions.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Include an installation link (this can simply be a webpage displaying the <strong>Add to Slack</strong> button and a guide on how to use your bot).</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Feature an customer support link and e-mail, in case users run into problems installing your bot.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Include a link to a privacy policy. Your bot could potentially be listening on private conversations, so you will need to specify exactly what data your bot will be collecting (if any).</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Have correct formatting and spelling. Your bot should use clear language and not contain any errors.</li></ul></div><p>Note that our example, Wikibot, fails the <em>appropriate name</em> clause, as Wikipedia is clearly a registered trademark to which we do not own the rights. On this basis alone, Wikibot would be rejected.</p><p>Once you have confirmed that your app or bot conforms to the previous points, you can submit your application for review at <a class="ulink" href="https://api.slack.com/submit">https://api.slack.com/submit</a>.</p><p>Like other app stores, a review process is mandatory for all new submissions. The length of the review period is highly dependent on the complexity of your app and on the quantity of submissions the Slack admissions team has to process.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note40"/>Note</h3><p>When you are ready to publish your app to the Slack app directory, you require hosting. A great way to <a class="indexterm" id="id332"/>get your bot up and running quickly is to use Beep Boop <a class="ulink" href="https://beepboophq.com/">https://beepboophq.com/</a>. A paid service, Beep Boop will host your Slack bots for you so you can focus on developing rather than infrastructure.</p></div></div><p>To ensure that your bot reaches your intended audience, consider submitting it to useful websites such as <a class="indexterm" id="id333"/>Botwiki (<a class="ulink" href="http://botwiki.org">http://botwiki.org</a>), botlist (<a class="ulink" href="http://botlist.co">http://botlist.co</a>), and <a class="indexterm" id="id334"/>Product Hunt (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.producthunt.com">http://www.producthunt.com</a>) in <a class="indexterm" id="id335"/>order to get maximum exposure.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec36"/>Monetizing your bot</h1></div></div></div><p>Monetizing your bot, of <a class="indexterm" id="id336"/>course, is entirely optional and how you monetize it is dependent on the function of your bot and whether there is a market. Bear in mind that if your goal is to sell your bots for a one-off price, the Slack app directory does not support monetary transfers.</p><p>All apps in the app directive are free to install, but how you convert your user base to paying customers is left up to you.</p><p>There are a variety of methods to do this and there is no single correct way or Slack-<em>sanctioned</em> method. A <a class="indexterm" id="id337"/>popular method employed by companies such as Zoho Expense (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.zoho.com/us/expense/slack-integration/">https://www.zoho.com/us/expense/slack-integration/</a>) is a payment plan based on users. The service is free for small teams, but once you require more than three users to have access, you have to migrate to a paid tier.</p><p>The idea here is similar to APIs we have encountered, such as Wolfram Alpha. This means using a tiered approach where a free tier exists (tied either to amount of calls made or an expiration date), but paid tiers are optional if more requests are needed.</p><p>Remember that when attempting to monetize your bot, the "try before you buy" sales tactic is key here. Users are unlikely to convert into paying customers if they don't have an idea of how your bot works and whether it is actually beneficial for them. Consider having either a free trial period or a free tier with limited functionality.</p><p>Above all, the most important aspect is ensuring that you have a product that is truly worth paying for. As useful as our <em>to-do</em> bot from <a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Using Data">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Using Data</em> is, it's unlikely that anyone would pay money for such a simple bot, as free alternatives are readily available or easily recreated.</p><p>Therefore, the focus of your bot should be the solving of a particular problem first and monetizing a distant second.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec49"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, you saw how to make your app accessible to other teams via the Slack App Directory. You saw how to request scopes from Slack to ensure that your apps have the correct permissions to perform actions. Finally, you learned how to correctly authenticate your apps with Slack and obtain the tokens required to make your bots, webhooks, and slash commands work.</p><p>By following the lessons in this book, you have obtained all the knowledge and tools required to create a world-class Slack bot. It is now up to you to create the next leap forward in bot technology and to push the boundaries of how we interact with bots to solve problems and achieve optimum efficiency.</p><p>To perhaps inspire you further, you should be aware that chat bots in general and Slack bots in particular are enjoying an unprecedented explosion in popularity and recognition.</p><p>At the beginning of his keynote speech at the 2016 Microsoft Build developers conference, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella prophesized the future of bots:</p><div><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><em>"Bots are the new apps.
