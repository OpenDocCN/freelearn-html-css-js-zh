<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec13"/>Creating the project</h1></div></div></div><p>First, to create a new <a id="id70" class="indexterm"/>Ext JS project, refer to the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/9819OS_02_02.jpg" alt="Creating the project"/></div><p>Right after the project is created, we will see the landing screen with the toolbar, canvas, project inspector, <a id="id71" class="indexterm"/>config panel, and toolbox. We will save our project right away. To do so, click on <strong>Save</strong> on the toolbox or press <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>S</em> (<em>cmd</em> + <em>S</em> on Mac OS). The <strong>Save Project</strong> screen<a id="id72" class="indexterm"/> will be displayed:</p><div><img src="img/9819OS_02_03.jpg" alt="Creating the project"/></div><p>We will save the project as <code class="literal">extBooks</code> inside the <code class="literal">sencha-architect</code> directory.</p><p>Now that the project is saved, we can start implementing it. We will follow the following development workflow: we will implement first the model then the store, view, and controller, and then repeat until our project is finished.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec14"/>A quick word about MVC</h2></div></div></div><p>
<strong>Model-View-Controller</strong> (<strong>MVC</strong>) is a software architecture pattern, which separates the<a id="id73" class="indexterm"/> representation of the information from the user's interaction with it. The model represents the application data, the view represents <a id="id74" class="indexterm"/>the output of the representation of the data (a form, grid, chart), and the controller mediates the input, converting it to commands for the model or view.</p><p>Ext JS and Sencha Touch use a <strong>Model-View-Controller-Store</strong> (<strong>MVCS</strong>) pattern. The model is a representation of the data we want to manipulate in our<a id="id75" class="indexterm"/> application (a representation of a table from the database). The view contains all the components and screens we create to manage the information of a model. As Ext JS is event driven, all the views fire events when the user interacts with them, and the controller will capture these events and will do something, redirecting the command to the model (or store) or the view. The store in Ext JS is very similar to the <a id="id76" class="indexterm"/>
<strong>Data Access Object</strong> (<strong>DAO</strong>) pattern used on the server side.</p><p>For a quick example, let's say we have <strong>WidgetA</strong>, which is a grid panel that displays all the records from<a id="id77" class="indexterm"/> the table A. <strong>ModelA</strong> represents this table. The <strong>StoreA</strong> table is responsible for retrieving the information (collection of <strong>ModelA</strong> from the server). When the user clicks on a record from <strong>WidgetA</strong>, a window will be opened (called <strong>WidgetB</strong>) that displays information from the table B (represented by <strong>ModelB</strong>). And of course, the <strong>StoreB</strong> will be responsible for retrieving the collection of <strong>ModelB</strong> from server. In this case, we will have <strong>ControllerA</strong> to capture the click event from <strong>WidgetA</strong> and do all the required logic to display <strong>WidgetB</strong> and load all the <strong>ModelB</strong> information. If we try to put this in a quick reference diagram, it would look something like the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/9819OS_02_28.jpg" alt="A quick word about MVC"/></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note03"/>Note</h3><p>For more information about MVC and Sencha applications, go to <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/4.2.1/#!/guide/application_architecture">http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/4.2.1/#!/guide/application_architecture</a>.</p></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec14"/>Configuring the app</h1></div></div></div><p>The first step is to set up the application we are going to develop throughout this chapter. Before we start, on the project inspector, select the <strong>Application</strong> option<a id="id78" class="indexterm"/> (<em>Step 1 in the following screenshot</em>) and then go to the config panel; locate the <strong>name</strong> property and set its value to <code class="literal">Packt</code> (<em>Step 2</em>). This is the namespace of our <a id="id79" class="indexterm"/>application, meaning that all the classes will be named <code class="literal">Packt.</code> <code class="literal">+</code> <code class="literal">package</code> <code class="literal">+</code> <code class="literal">className</code>. Many programming languages use namespacing to avoid collisions with other objects or variables in the global namespace. If we open the code editor, the code we will see is the same as on <em>Step 3</em>:</p><div><img src="img/9819OS_02_04.jpg" alt="Configuring the app"/></div><p>All these configurations will be applied on the <code class="literal">app.js</code> file, since the <strong>Application</strong> option represents the <code class="literal">app.js</code> file.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec15"/>Creating the model</h1></div></div></div><p>Following our development <a id="id80" class="indexterm"/>workflow, we will start with the model. On the top of the project inspector, click on the <strong>+</strong> icon and select <strong>Model</strong> (<em>Step 1</em>):</p><div><img src="img/9819OS_02_05.jpg" alt="Creating the model"/></div><p>Once the model is created, select it, go to the config panel, and set the class name (<strong>userClassName</strong>) to <strong>Book</strong> (<em>Step 2</em>). Then, still on the config panel, locate the <strong>Fields</strong> option, click on its <strong>+</strong> icon, and add the first field, which we will name <code class="literal">id</code>. Continue adding the<a id="id81" class="indexterm"/> following fields: <strong>id</strong>, <strong>name</strong>, <strong>author</strong>, <strong>language</strong>, <strong>paperback</strong>, <strong>releaseDate</strong>, <strong>isbn</strong>,and <strong>isbn13</strong>, as shown in the following screenshot (<em>Step 4</em>):</p><div><img src="img/9819OS_02_06.jpg" alt="Creating the model"/></div><p>If we go back to the project inspector, the book model should look like <em>Step 5</em>. If we look at the canvas, nothing will be displayed on the design mode, but if we take a look at the code editor, the <code class="literal">Packt.model.Book</code> class<a id="id82" class="indexterm"/> will be defined. If we try to edit its code, it will not be possible, because we have a simple model with no functions or methods inside it (created by ourselves).</p><p>Once we save the project and take a look at the files that Sencha Architect has created so far, we will see that it created a file named <code class="literal">Book.js</code> inside the <code class="literal">app/model</code> directory.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec16"/>Creating the store</h1></div></div></div><p>The next step is to create a store. Our data is going to come from the server (Java, Ruby, PHP, .NET, and so on), <a id="id83" class="indexterm"/>and we will use Ajax to load it. So, we need to create a store that will use an Ajax Proxy to read information that is coming from the server in a <strong>JavaScript Object Notation</strong> (<strong>JSON</strong>) format. So, we need to<a id="id84" class="indexterm"/> go back to the project inspector, click on the <strong>+</strong> icon again, and select <strong>Store</strong> and <strong>Json Store</strong>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/9819OS_02_07.jpg" alt="Creating the store"/></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note04"/>Note</h3><p>For more information about Ajax Proxy and Json Store, go to <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/4.2.1/#!/api/Ext.data.proxy.Ajax">http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/4.2.1/#!/api/Ext.data.proxy.Ajax</a>.</p></div></div><p>Right after we create the store, we will see a red exclamation mark icon (<em>Step 1</em>). If we click on it (<em>Step 1</em>), we will see an error message saying that we need to associate a model to this store or create<a id="id85" class="indexterm"/> at least one field on the store (<em>Step 2</em>). As we already have a model, click on the store (<strong>MyJsonStore</strong>) on the project inspector, go to the config panel, search for <code class="literal">model</code>, and then you can choose from the list the <strong>Book</strong> model (which is already created) (<em>Step 3</em>). In this case, we have only created the <strong>Book</strong> model:</p><div><img src="img/9819OS_02_08.jpg" alt="Creating the store"/></div><p>Next, we need to give a name to our store. We will call it <code class="literal">Books</code> (following the Sencha MVC convention, the store name should be the plural of the model name). Sencha Architect also automatically creates the <strong>storeId</strong> field for the store. Let's also change it to <strong>books</strong> (as we can see<a id="id86" class="indexterm"/> in the following screenshot). Also, search for the <code class="literal">pageSize</code> property and set it to <code class="literal">5</code> (we will use a paging toolbar later):</p><div><img src="img/9819OS_02_09.jpg" alt="Creating the store"/></div><p>Then next step is to select the proxy (<strong>MyAjaxProxy</strong>) under the <strong>Books</strong> store in the project inspector and locate the <strong>url</strong> configuration and set its value to <code class="literal">http://localhost/sencha-architect/extBooks/php/list.php</code>. We are going to create the server code for this example inside the <code class="literal">php</code> folder. You can get the server-side code within the source code distributed with this book.</p><div><img src="img/9819OS_02_10.jpg" alt="Creating the store"/></div><p>And finally, we need to set some configurations for the reader. To do so, please select the <strong>MyJsonReader</strong> store<a id="id87" class="indexterm"/>, locate the <strong>root</strong> property, and set its value to <strong>data</strong>:</p><div><img src="img/9819OS_02_11.jpg" alt="Creating the store"/></div><p>When we load the information from the server, we expect to receive a JSON object that will have a property named <strong>data</strong>, which will wrap the collection of book objects.</p><p>The last step to test—if everything is okay—is to load the store. To do it, select the <strong>Books</strong> store, right-click on it, and select <strong>Load Data</strong>; then, a new window will be displayed with the data loaded from the server. If you want to see the information that was loaded, you can also click on the eye icon as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/9819OS_02_12.jpg" alt="Creating the store"/></div><p>We set the proxy URL as <code class="literal">http://localhost/sencha-architect/extBooks/php/list.php</code> (the complete path) so we can perform this test. Usually, we simply <a id="id88" class="indexterm"/>need to set the relative URL; in our case, it is <code class="literal">php/list.php</code>. The complete URL is only for testing.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note05"/>Note</h3><p>You can find the <code class="literal">list.php</code> file inside the <code class="literal">extbooks</code> project available for download at <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/loiane/sencha-architect-app-development">https://github.com/loiane/sencha-architect-app-development</a>. Before executing the project, please execute the <code class="literal">dbscript.sql</code> file and change the user and password inside the <code class="literal">db.php</code> file to connect to your database.</p></div></div><p>A mistake most developers make is to have the server code deployed on a server and the Sencha Architect project deployed in a different location. We always need to remember that we are using an Ajax Proxy, meaning that the calls need to be made from the same URL (server) as the project is deployed. If you would like to use a different domain/server, you can use the JSONP proxy or enable <strong>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</strong>
<a id="id89" class="indexterm"/> (<strong>CORS</strong>) in the server side.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note06"/>Note</h3><p>To learn more about CORS, please go to <a class="ulink" href="http://enable-cors.org/">http://enable-cors.org/</a>.</p></div></div><p>Once we save the project and take a look at the files that Sencha Architect has created so far, we will see that it <a id="id90" class="indexterm"/>created a file named <code class="literal">Books.js</code> inside the <code class="literal">app/store</code> directory.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec17"/>Creating the books grid</h1></div></div></div><p>In the next step, we will create our first view, which is the books grid. There are two ways of creating a view. You <a id="id91" class="indexterm"/>can choose the one you like the most. The first one requires selecting the <strong>Views</strong> package on the project inspector, going to the toolbox, locating the <strong>Grid Panel</strong> component, and then double-clicking on it. A new <strong>Grid Panel</strong> view<a id="id92" class="indexterm"/> called <code class="literal">MyGridPanel</code> will be created under the <strong>Views</strong> package:</p><div><img src="img/9819OS_02_13.jpg" alt="Creating the books grid"/></div><p>You can use this approach for anything. If you want to add a toolbar to the grid, select the grid from the project inspector then go to the toolbar and double-click on the component you would like to add as an item of the grid (or any other view, store, model, or controller from the project inspector).</p><p>The second way of doing it is to select the component from the toolbox and drag-and-drop it inside the <strong>Views</strong> package (or it can be a view, store, model, or controller as well):</p><div><img src="img/9819OS_02_14.jpg" alt="Creating the books grid"/></div><p>Once we have the <code class="literal">MyGridPanel</code> component under the <strong>Views</strong> package, we need to set some configurations. Select the <code class="literal">MyGridPanel</code> view, go to the config panel, uncheck the <strong>initialView</strong> property, <a id="id93" class="indexterm"/>set <strong>userAlias</strong> as <strong>booksgrid</strong> (alias convention is all in lowercase),and set <strong>userClassName</strong> as <strong>BooksGrid</strong> (which is the name of the class) as shown by <em>Step 1</em>. Then, locate the <strong>store</strong> property and select the <strong>Books</strong> store (<em>Step 2</em>):</p><div><img src="img/9819OS_02_15.jpg" alt="Creating the books grid"/></div><p>Now that our class is named <strong>BooksGrid</strong> in <strong>Views</strong>, select it, right-click on it, and select <strong>Auto columns</strong> (<em>Step 3</em>). This<a id="id94" class="indexterm"/> will generate all the columns based on the fields of the model that is associated with the store we set for the <strong>BooksGrid</strong> class (<em>Step 4</em>). However: we can only generate the autocolumns once we have the store set on the grid.</p><p>Next, we can go to the <strong>Design</strong> tab<a id="id95" class="indexterm"/> on the canvas and change a few things, such as the grid title, column titles, and column width. To modify the title of the grid or a column, simply double-click on it as follows (or you can do it by using the config panel):</p><div><img src="img/9819OS_02_16.jpg" alt="Creating the books grid"/></div><p>These features can save us some time, because we do not need to go to the config panel to configure them.</p><p>Our last step is to add a paging toolbar to the books grid. Select the <strong>BooksGrid</strong> class<a id="id96" class="indexterm"/> on the project inspector, go to the toolbox, locate the paging toolbar, and double- click on it. The paging toolbar will be added to the <strong>BooksGrid</strong> class (or you can drag it from the toolbox and drop it on the <strong>BooksGrid</strong> class). As the store is already set on the grid, it will be set automatically to the paging toolbar as well.</p><p>Once we save <a id="id97" class="indexterm"/>the project and take a look at the files that Sencha Architect has created so far, we will see that it created a file named <code class="literal">BooksGrid.js</code> inside the <code class="literal">app/view</code> directory.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec18"/>Creating the viewport</h1></div></div></div><p>Our next step is to create a viewport. To do so, select the <strong>Views</strong> package (<em>Step 1</em>), and on the toolbox, locate the <strong>Viewport</strong> component and double-click on it (<em>Step 2</em>). Select the <strong>MyViewport</strong> view from the <strong>Views</strong> package on the project inspector, go to the config panel, and set some properties: mark <strong>initialView</strong> and set <strong>userClassName</strong> as <strong>Main</strong> (<em>Step 3</em>). Finally, go to the <a id="id98" class="indexterm"/>
<strong>Design</strong> tab and click on the blank area. A blue border should be displayed. Select the flyout config button and select <strong>fit</strong> as <strong>Layout</strong> as demonstrated in the following screenshot (<em>Step 4</em>):</p><div><img src="img/9819OS_02_17.jpg" alt="Creating the viewport"/></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note07"/>Note</h3><p>To learn more about viewports, please go to <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/4.2.1/#!/api/Ext.container">http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/4.2.1/#!/api/Ext.container</a>. To learn more about the Fit Layout, please go to <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/4.2.1/#!/api/Ext.layout.container.Fit">http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/4.2.1/#!/api/Ext.layout.container.Fit</a>.</p></div></div><p>We cannot forget to always have <strong>initialView</strong> on the project. One of the <strong>View</strong> classes must have the <a id="id99" class="indexterm"/>highlighted icon as shown in the next screenshot, otherwise we will get a blank screen when we execute the project:</p><div><img src="img/9819OS_02_18.jpg" alt="Creating the viewport"/></div><p>Once we save the project and take a look at the files that Sencha Architect has created so far, we will see that it created a file named <code class="literal">Main.js</code> inside the <code class="literal">app/view</code> directory.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec15"/>Linking the grid to the viewport</h2></div></div></div><p>Our next goal is to make<a id="id100" class="indexterm"/> the <code class="literal">booksgrid</code> class<a id="id101" class="indexterm"/> an item of the viewport we created. So, let's go ahead and make it happen. The first step is to select the <code class="literal">booksgrid</code> class, then drag-and-drop it on the <code class="literal">Main</code> class:</p><div><img src="img/9819OS_02_19.jpg" alt="Linking the grid to the viewport"/></div><p>A window will be displayed with a <strong>Copy</strong> <strong>Component</strong> question. We will choose <strong>Link</strong>; this way, our <code class="literal">booksgrid</code> class will continue a class and we can reuse its code. If we choose <strong>Copy</strong>, Sencha Architect will copy all the <strong>BooksGrid</strong> code into the <code class="literal">Main</code> class as an item. And if we choose <strong>Move</strong>, Sencha Architect will delete the <code class="literal">booksgrid</code> class and put all its code inside the <code class="literal">Main</code> class as an item.</p><p>As a result, we will see a blue line connecting the <code class="literal">booksgrid</code> class to the <code class="literal">Main</code> class. If we verify the <code class="literal">Main</code> class source code on the code editor, we will notice that the <code class="literal">booksgrid</code> class is <a id="id102" class="indexterm"/>declared as an item of the viewport by using its <strong>xtype</strong> (the <code class="literal">userAlias</code> property on the config panel):</p><div><img src="img/9819OS_02_20.jpg" alt="Linking the grid to the viewport"/></div><p>Linking components is a great way of reusing components on Sencha Architect.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec16"/>The output so far</h2></div></div></div><p>It is time to execute our <a id="id103" class="indexterm"/>project for the first time. On the toolbar, click on the <strong>Preview</strong> icon. Your default browser will open a page like this:</p><div><img src="img/9819OS_02_21.jpg" alt="The output so far"/></div><p>This is because Sencha Architect thinks the <code class="literal">app.html</code> page, which is the page that contains all the code from<a id="id104" class="indexterm"/> our application (Sencha Architect creates the <code class="literal">app.html</code> file instead of <code class="literal">index.html</code>), is deployed on the <code class="literal">root</code> folder of the webserver, which is not true. In our case, the application is located at the <code class="literal">htdocs/sencha-architect/extBooks</code> directory (<code class="literal">htdocs</code> is the public folder of Xampp). So, we need to set the correct location on the project's settings. On the toolbar, click on the <a id="id105" class="indexterm"/>
<strong>Settings</strong> icon. A new window will be displayed; click on the <strong>Project</strong> tab and put the full path to the project's directory as shown in the following screenshot (<strong>URL prefix</strong>):</p><div><img src="img/9819OS_02_22.jpg" alt="The output so far"/></div><p>Now, if we try to execute the project again, it will open the correct URL with the grid we just created:</p><div><img src="img/9819OS_02_23.jpg" alt="The output so far"/></div><p>But wait a second, the grid is empty, and on the test we performed with the store, the server is returning some data. We need<a id="id106" class="indexterm"/> to create a controller to load the store when the grid is rendered; this way, we will have some information displayed inside the grid.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec19"/>Creating the controller</h1></div></div></div><p>So, to create the controller, let's go back to the top of the project inspector and click on the <strong>+</strong> icon once again and select the<a id="id107" class="indexterm"/> <strong>Controller</strong> option (<em>Step 1</em>). Then, with the controller selected, go to the config panel and change its <strong>userClassname</strong> to <strong>Book</strong> (<em>Step 2</em>):</p><div><img src="img/9819OS_02_24.jpg" alt="Creating the controller"/></div><p>Still on the config panel, locate the <strong>models</strong>, <strong>stores</strong>, and <strong>views</strong> properties (<em>Step 3</em>). With these properties, we will declare the <strong>models</strong>, <strong>stores</strong>, and <strong>views</strong> that this controller will care about. Once you <a id="id108" class="indexterm"/>select a model, store, or view, Sencha Architect will display the following window with a question. Click on <strong>Remove</strong>:</p><div><img src="img/9819OS_02_25.jpg" alt="Creating the controller"/></div><p>This is because on the application (<code class="literal">app.js</code>), as we create models, stores, and views, they will be declared on the <strong>models</strong>, <strong>views</strong>, and <strong>stores</strong> properties of the application. With this step, we are transferring the responsibility to the controller, and there is no need to keep their declaration on the <code class="literal">app.js</code> file and also on the controller (which is what will happen if we click on the <strong>Keep</strong> button).</p><p>The next step is to add <strong>Controller</strong> <strong>Action</strong> to the <strong>Book</strong> controller. To do so, select the <strong>Book</strong> controller on the project inspector, go to the toolbox, locate <strong>Controler</strong> <strong>Action</strong>, and double-click on it (or drag-and-drop, as you wish) as demonstrated by <em>Step 1</em>. Once <strong>Controller</strong> <strong>Action</strong> is listed under the <strong>Book</strong> controller, select it (<em>Step 2</em>), go to the config panel, and choose <strong>BooksGrid</strong> as <strong>targetType</strong>; then on <strong>EventBinding</strong>, select the name of the event we want to listen to, which is <strong>render</strong>. If you would like, you can change the <strong>controlQuery</strong> to be more specific and the name of <strong>BasicFunction</strong> (<strong>fn</strong>) as well (<em>Step 3</em>):</p><div><img src="img/9819OS_02_26.jpg" alt="Creating the controller"/></div><p>After these steps, the code editor will open the <strong>onGridpanelRender</strong> function editor, so we can add the <a id="id109" class="indexterm"/>code we desire (we need to enter the code as shown in <em>Step 4</em>). In this case, the render event passes the grid reference (<strong>component</strong>) as a parameter and also some options (<strong>eOpts</strong>). So, we need to get the grid reference (<strong>component</strong>), call the <code class="literal">getStore</code> method<a id="id110" class="indexterm"/> to get the store reference, and then the <code class="literal">load</code> method so the store can load the information from the server (<em>Step 4</em>).</p><p>Notice that we worked on the model, store, views and in the controller. Sencha Architect has generated all the code so far for us. Only now, on a controller action, do we have to use the code editor.</p><p>Once we save the project and take a look at the files that Sencha Architect has created so far, we will see that it created a file named <code class="literal">Book.js</code> inside the <code class="literal">app/controller</code> directory.</p><p>We can click on the preview icon again on the toolbar and now we will see the final version of our project.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec20"/>The final project structure</h1></div></div></div><p>As we have now finished<a id="id111" class="indexterm"/> implementing our first Ext JS project with Sencha Architect, let's take a look at the code generated for us:</p><div><img src="img/9819OS_02_27.jpg" alt="The final project structure"/></div><p>Notice that Sencha Architect created all the files for us (with the exception of the server-side code <code class="literal">php</code> folder).</p><p>It is very important to bring to our attention that we cannot modify the files on a code editor. In case we do modify any files and try to open them on Sencha Architect again, all changes will be lost because Sencha Architect will override them. So, in case you decide you want to change any file on a code editor, it is important to know that you will not be able to use Sencha Architect again (and if you do, you will lose the modifications).</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec21"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, we learned how to implement our first Ext JS project using Sencha Architect. We learned how to create a new Ext JS project and set up the <code class="literal">app.js</code> file using the application. We learned how to create models, stores, views, and controller, and how to reuse a component by linking it to another component. We have also learned how to test a store to see if the information is being loaded from the server correctly and how to configure the project settings to execute it for the first time.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will create our first Sencha Touch application with Sencha Architect.</p></div></body></html>
