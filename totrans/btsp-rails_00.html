So, you want to learn Bootstrap and its awesomeness and implement it in a Rails project? I think you made the right choice by selecting this book.</p><p>Web designing is not everyone's cup of tea. I have seen many experienced web developers who are extremely poor at web designing. They have the ability to make the most powerful applications, but lack the skills to create a decent looking website.</p><p>On the other hand, there's a sudden rise in the popularity of CSS and JavaScript frontend frameworks. These frameworks let the users create popular CSS and JavaScript components, such as drop-down menus, responsive menus, a proper grid system to structure websites, and so on easily without having any knowledge about CSS and JavaScript coding. Bootstrap, being one of the pioneers in the book, provides many prestyled CSS components that come ready to be used. You simply need to know the appropriate HTML files to use these frontend frameworks.</p><p>This book will help you understand what Bootstrap is, and how it can be used in a Rails environment. It will guide you through various CSS and JavaScript components of Bootstrap via many practical examples. If you are a Sass developer, this book will help you identify various Sass variables to customize Bootstrap.</p><p>I hope you have fun reading this book!</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
