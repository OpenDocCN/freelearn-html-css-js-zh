- en: The Titanium mobile SDK is open source under the Apache 2 license and available
    on Github. Titanium is built using the same module API as third-party modules
    leverage. Because of this, viewing the Titanium SDK code provides insight into
    the practices for developing such modules. Having the code available provides
    a powerful learning opportunity for Titanium developers as they are able to see
    how their JavaScript interacts with the underlying platform.
