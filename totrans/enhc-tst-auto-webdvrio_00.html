			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>Welcome, and let us embark on an extraordinary journey through the realm of coding with our superhero-themed technical manual! Bid farewell to the mundane as each chapter unfolds like an exciting comic book adventure. Unlike traditional superheroes, you won’t need a brush with a radioactive arachnid to unlock your coding powers. Instead, you will arm yourself with the essential tools to forge a formidable framework using WebdriverIO <span class="No-Break">in TypeScript.</span></p>
			<p>For those stepping into the shoes of a <strong class="bold">Software Developer Engineer in Test</strong> (<strong class="bold">SDET</strong>), the allure of leaping into setting up your JavaScript coding environment, running that inaugural test, and hoping for a victorious pass result might be strong. We’ve been there, only to discover later that crucial tools were overlooked, tools that could have smoothed the path from the very beginning. That’s why the opening chapter dives into system specifications, tools, and configurations, laying the foundation for crafting superior code from <span class="No-Break">day one.</span></p>
			<p>Prepare to be guided by the wisdom of authors who have spent over 20 years in the superhero league of SDETs. Discover tips, tricks, rules of thumb, and advanced techniques tailored to help you not only write more tests but also navigate debugging challenges with finesse. Elevate your testing framework to superhero status—stable, scalable, and requiring minimal code maintenance. Get ready to unleash your coding superpowers and make your mark in the coding <span class="No-Break">superhero universe!</span></p>

			<p>The authors have attempted to use freely available tools for readers’ benefit. There are other paid IDEs available that offer more coding features to make life easier. In addition, the free version of SelectorsHub does an exceptional job, but we recommend the paid Pro version for its advanced Shadow Dom features. Free GitHub accounts are public while paid repos <span class="No-Break">are private.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">If you are using the digital version of this book, we advise you to type the code yourself or access the code from the book’s GitHub repository (a link is available in the next section). Doing so will help you avoid any potential errors related to the copying and pasting </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">of code.</strong></span></p>
			<p>If you are new to test automation, we advise you to get machines equivalent to, or better than, the specification used by the product development team you will be supporting. There is a common misconception that automation is just “record and playback” and does not require heavy-duty resources. There is one simple fact to keep in mind: parallel browsers and virtual machine testing require <span class="No-Break">more resources.</span></p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-11"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"/>Conventions used</h1>
			<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout <span class="No-Break">this book.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">Code in text</strong>: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. Here is an example: “We have a <strong class="source-inline">host</strong> command and a <strong class="source-inline">ghost</strong> party. Writing this line of code could potentially take the <strong class="source-inline">host</strong> command from the <span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline">ghost</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> string.”</span></p>
			<p>A block of code is set <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="source-code">
Set JOURNEY="Attend Ghost"; yarn ch15
if (journey.includes(" host").toLowerCase()) {
// Host path being taken in error.
}</pre>			<p>Any command-line input or output is written <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<pre class="console">
[0-0] ---&gt; Clicking button[type="submit"] ...
[0-0] ---&gt; button clicked.
[0-0] ---&gt; pageSync() completed in 25 ms
[0-0] ---&gt; Clicking button[type="bogus"] ...
[0-0] ---&gt; button[type="submit"] was not clicked.
[0-0] Error: Can't call click on element with selector "button[type="bogus"]" because element wasn't found</pre>			<p><strong class="bold">Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see onscreen. For instance, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in <strong class="bold">bold</strong>. Here is an example: “In this example, the user does not attend the party and instead clicks the <strong class="bold">I’m </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">scared</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> button.”</span></p>
