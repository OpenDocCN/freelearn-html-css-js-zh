    section was added to provide teachers and students with a separate page to view
    all materials, questions, and assignments. Each type of post has a different set
    of features that allow teachers to communicate with students in different ways.
    While the previous chapter discussed announcements and how students can comment
    on announcements, you may have situations where you want to record who responded
    to a post and even grade that response. An example of this situation is when you
    want to have a dialogue like a classroom discussion but through Google Classroom.

- en: There are several advantages to having discussions through Google Classroom.
    In a generation of Instagram and Snapchat, many students will feel comfortable
    communicating through an online tool. Furthermore, students do not have to be
    in the same location to participate. During my time teaching, there were times
    when students were absent on critical discussion days and could not be assessed.
    In addition, students can take time to formulate their responses, rather than
    being put on the spot during a discussion. Therefore, students tend to feel more
    secure discussing things online instead of in an in-person class because of its
    familiarity and a lower chance of failure.

    Favoring one form of discussion can reduce the effectiveness of the other. Consider
    incorporating both types of discussion. Some examples of methods of incorporating
    both online and in-class discussions include asking a discussion question online
    and then asking a follow-up question in class the next day or discussing different
    topics in class and online.

- en: Another use of question posts is to quickly check student understanding. In
    Alberta, teachers use formative assessment to gauge whether students comprehend
    the current concept before moving to the next concept. Since question posts allow
    students to respond in short sentences or answer multiple-choice questions, a
    question in Google Classroom can show you whether the majority of your students
    understand the current lesson.

- en: For question and assignment posts, the total points must be a numerical value.
    In Canada, many primary schools use a letter grade system to assess students.
    If your system is similar, a solution is to relate letter grades to a number value.
    For example, an A grade will be 4 points, a B grade 3 points, and so on.
