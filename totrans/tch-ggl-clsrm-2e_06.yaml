- en: In 2018, Google Classroom went through a major layout change. The **Classwork**
    section was added to provide teachers and students with a separate page to view
    all materials, questions, and assignments. Each type of post has a different set
    of features that allow teachers to communicate with students in different ways.
    While the previous chapter discussed announcements and how students can comment
    on announcements, you may have situations where you want to record who responded
    to a post and even grade that response. An example of this situation is when you
    want to have a dialogue like a classroom discussion but through Google Classroom.

  zh: 2018年，Google Classroom 经历了一次重大的布局变更。**作业**部分被添加，为教师和学生提供了一个单独的页面来查看所有材料、问题和作业。每种类型的帖子都有不同的功能集，允许教师以不同的方式与学生沟通。虽然上一章讨论了公告以及学生如何对公告进行评论，但你可能会遇到需要记录谁对帖子做出了回应甚至评分该回应的情况。这种情况的一个例子是，你想要进行类似于课堂讨论的对话，但通过
    Google Classroom 进行。
- en: There are several advantages to having discussions through Google Classroom.
    In a generation of Instagram and Snapchat, many students will feel comfortable
    communicating through an online tool. Furthermore, students do not have to be
    in the same location to participate. During my time teaching, there were times
    when students were absent on critical discussion days and could not be assessed.
    In addition, students can take time to formulate their responses, rather than
    being put on the spot during a discussion. Therefore, students tend to feel more
    secure discussing things online instead of in an in-person class because of its
    familiarity and a lower chance of failure.

  zh: 通过 Google Classroom 进行讨论有几个优点。在 Instagram 和 Snapchat 的一代中，许多学生可能会觉得通过在线工具进行沟通很舒服。此外，学生不必身处同一地点就能参与讨论。在我教书的时间里，有时学生会在关键的讨论日缺席，无法进行评估。此外，学生可以有时间来制定他们的回答，而不是在讨论中被突然提问。因此，由于它的熟悉性和较低的失败率，学生倾向于在网上而不是在面对面课堂上讨论事情。

- en: There is a delicate balance between the use of online and in-class discussions.
    Favoring one form of discussion can reduce the effectiveness of the other. Consider
    incorporating both types of discussion. Some examples of methods of incorporating
    both online and in-class discussions include asking a discussion question online
    and then asking a follow-up question in class the next day or discussing different
    topics in class and online.

  zh: 在线上和课堂讨论的使用之间需要保持微妙的平衡。过分偏爱某一种讨论形式可能会降低另一种讨论的有效性。考虑结合这两种讨论方式。一些结合线上和课堂讨论的方法包括在网上提出一个讨论问题，然后在第二天课堂上提出一个后续问题，或者课堂上讨论不同的主题，然后在线上继续讨论。
- en: Another use of question posts is to quickly check student understanding. In
    Alberta, teachers use formative assessment to gauge whether students comprehend
    the current concept before moving to the next concept. Since question posts allow
    students to respond in short sentences or answer multiple-choice questions, a
    question in Google Classroom can show you whether the majority of your students
    understand the current lesson.

  zh: 问题帖子的另一种用途是快速检查学生的理解。在阿尔伯塔省，教师使用形成性评估来衡量学生在学习下一个概念之前是否理解了当前的概念。由于问题帖子允许学生用简短的句子回答或回答多项选择题，Google
    Classroom 中的一个问题可以显示大多数学生是否理解了当前的课程内容。

    meaningful feedback than letting students see the class summary immediately. With
    immediate feedback, students who completed the question quickly could not see
    the rest of the results without refreshing Google Classroom and the stragglers
    could wait and see what most of the class selected and choose accordingly. Instead,
    I found that revealing the summary after the majority of the students had completed
    the question worked better. Clicking on the title of a published multiple-choice
    question post will go to the summary of responses. More about this page in the
