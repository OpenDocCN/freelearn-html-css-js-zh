- en: APIs are at the core of every serious web application. Node.js is an especially
    exciting tool that is easy to use, allows you to build APIs, and develop your
    backend code in JavaScript. It powers the server side of web apps, including PayPal,
    Netflix, and Zenhub.

- en: Express.js is the most popular framework that can be used to build on top of
    Node.js—it provides an essential level of abstraction to develop robust web applications.
    With the emergence of this minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework,
    creating Node.js applications has become much simpler, faster, and also requires
    minimal effort.
