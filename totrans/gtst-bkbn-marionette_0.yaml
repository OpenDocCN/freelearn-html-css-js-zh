- en: Backbone Marionette is a composite application library for `Backbone.js`, which
    aims to simplify the construction of large-scale JavaScript applications. It is
    a collection of common design and implementation patterns found in the applications
    that we build with Backbone, and includes pieces inspired by composite application,
    event-driven, and messaging architectures.

    it aims to solve. In this chapter, we also learn about its prerequisites, download
    sources, and documentation.'

    introduces three main concepts of Marionette—the application, controller, and
    router objects— and details the process of building a small application.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Managing Views"), *Managing Views*, reviews
    the view management that goes from firing a view, closing it, and re-opening it.
    We will also introduce some useful objects, such as the `Renderer` object and
    the `TemplateCache` object, that are very valuable in order to build an application.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Divide and Conquer – Modularizing Everything"),
    *Divide and Conquer – Modularizing Everything*, talks about how to modularize
    an application and break it into small subapplications. Being able to do this
    will increase its productivity as the modules allow the adding of new functionality
    without affecting the existing code.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Messaging"), *Messaging*, explains that in
    order to build a loosely coupled application, the components need to know very
    little about each other; however, these components still need to work together.
    In this chapter, we also learn how to archive this through messages and events.'

    helps us to learn how to manage a problem that comes with large-scale applications:
    the file explosions, and how to keep a clean structure.'
