- en: The Force.com platform can automatically generate user interfaces (standard
    pages), but in some cases you might need to build a more customized UI. Visualforce
    allows developers to build sophisticated and customized user interfaces that can
    be hosted natively on the Force.com platform. Visualforce is a framework that
    includes a tag-based markup language similar to HTML.
