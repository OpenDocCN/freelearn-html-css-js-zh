- en: Making maps used to require an extensive knowledge of cartography, expensive
    software, and technical know-how. Today, there are numerous tools available, many
    of which are free, that have simplified the map-making process. This book is about
    using one such library, Leaflet.js.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Leaflet.js is a JavaScript library that although small, is packed with almost
    every feature you could need. If a feature is not available in the core library,
    it may be available as one of the many plugins that have become available. The
    largest map-making software vendor, Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI),
    has even released a plugin for Leaflet.js. If you are interested in making maps
    or in data visualization, Leaflet.js is the library to learn.

- en: Whether you are looking to build simple maps or advanced mapping applications,
    this book will build on your JavaScript knowledge to help you reach your goal.
    This book was designed to be accessible to individuals who are new to map making
    and also to those who may know maps but are just learning to code.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Creating Maps with Leaflet"), *Creating Maps
    with Leaflet*, walks you through the basics of making maps in Leaflet.js. You
    start by creating an HTML file with the minimum JavaScript code required to display
    a map. You are going to learn how to select different basemaps and providers and
    different basemap formats. Then, you will learn how to display geographic features
    such as points, polylines, and polygons.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Mapping GeoJSON Data"), *Mapping GeoJSON
    Data*, introduces you to a geographic version of the JSON data format. You will
    learn how to create your own GeoJSON data as well as consume data from other sources.
    In this chapter, you will learn how to style the data and iterate through features
    to add pop ups.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Creating Heatmaps and Choropleth Maps"),
    *Creating Heatmaps and Choropleth Maps*, moves away from simply displaying points
    and towards displaying the significance or comparisons of the data. It builds
    on what you have learned so far and teaches you how to use different plugins to
    create heatmaps. You will also learn how to use your knowledge of styling GeoJSON
    to create choropleth maps.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Creating Custom Markers"), *Creating Custom
    Markers*, guides you through the customization of the markers you use in your
    maps. You will learn how to draw your own image or modify an existing image to
    use it as a marker in your map. You will be introduced to several plugins that
    offer premade markers that are customizable. Also, you will learn how to animate
    markers and combine plugins for added effects.'

    up the most commonly used data formats and server endpoints in mapping. This chapter
    will teach you how to load shapefiles in your maps. You will also learn how to
    connect to an ESRI server that has an exposed REST service. Using the ESRI-Leaflet
    plugin, you will learn how to geocode and reverse geocode addresses, filter data
    from a server, and query by location.'

    in Node.js, Python, and C#*, expands on everything you have learned in order to
    teach you how to build applications in other frameworks and languages. This chapter
    teaches you how to build both the frontend and the backend. You will build servers
    in JavaScript and Python. You will be introduced to NoSQL databases and AJAX to
    display and update data without refreshing your web page. Lastly, you will learn
    how to create a Windows desktop application by embedding Leaflet in C#.'
