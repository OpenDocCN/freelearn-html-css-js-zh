- en: There are many JavaScript books on the market these days, and some of them are
    very good. However, most of them focus on various aspects of the language itself
    or using certain frameworks to build JavaScript applications. In this book, we
    are going to take a different approach and look at the architectural design of
    creating JavaScript applications based on modules, without the need for third-party
    frameworks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Creating a good application is more than just writing good code, it is also
    about how different pieces of the application work and interact with each other.
    Another characteristic of a good application is its ability to be easily maintained,
    scaled and extended as needed. A proper modular design enables us to achieve all
    such goals in our application seamlessly.

- en: In the beginning of this book, I'll be introducing you to the fundamentals of
    JavaScript modules and the concepts behind a good modular design. Leveraging these
    concepts, we'll be building an application together, step-by-step, so we can apply
    what we learn in practice. I recommend reading the chapters in the sequence that
    they are presented so you can follow along with ease and observe how our design
    evolves over time.

- en: I would very much encourage you to develop the application pieces with me, as
    the intent of this book is to be very hands-on, and I would like you to feel as
    a member of the development team for this application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As in the real world, we will be re-factoring our code-base a few times during
    the development phase, in order to implement the new concepts as they are introduced
    and improve the quality of our application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keep in mind that we will be creating a client-side application, and as such,
    there is no server-side code involved. Nonetheless, many concepts that we will
    be covering regarding modules and modular architecture can be applied to server-side
    applications too.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, as this book is an introduction to modular JavaScript application design,
    we will develop a Proof of concept (POC)-grade application together which can
    provide a good starting point for your own projects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I have taken a minimalist approach in the implementation, and as a result, we
    will be using very few third-party libraries in our development process. Therefore,
    instead of focusing on studying new libraries and how to work with them, you can
    focus on the application's architecture instead. Once we create a solid foundation,
    we can incorporate other libraries into our design as required.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For the purposes of clarity, I have shied away from writing fancy code, so you
    don't have to spend much time trying to understand the intricacies of the code,
    as opposed to the big picture and how the pieces fit and work together.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note that this book is meant for people who have a good understanding of JavaScript
    language, but would like to learn more about JavaScript client-side application
    design. If you find yourself having trouble with the language itself, you can
    always refer to online resources and the JavaScript community. This community
    consists of many smart and helpful people who can, and will be willing to answer
    your questions. I, for one, am very grateful to the community for its help in
    my professional growth over the years.
