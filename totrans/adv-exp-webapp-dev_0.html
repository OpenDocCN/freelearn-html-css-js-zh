Express applications that need to survive in a production environment will need to reach out to the <em>Node</em> ecosystem and beyond for support. <em>Advanced Express Web Application Development</em> aims to deliver a working real-world, single-page application that can meet these goals and allow us the opportunity to explore the more advanced features of Express.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Foundations">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Foundations</em>, lays the foundation as we put in place a skeleton application; we introduce testing and automation practices that we will use to build our example single-page application.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Building a Web API">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Building a Web API</em>, helps in building a web API that our application will consume.</p><p>
