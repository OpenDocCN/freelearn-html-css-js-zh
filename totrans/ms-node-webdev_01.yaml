- en: Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime that has become one of the most
    popular platforms for creating web applications. Node.js benefits from a vast
    library of packages and frameworks, providing every kind of feature and function
    imaginable, built on a rich API that Node.js provides for handling low-level tasks.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is different from most other Node.js books because it explains the
    relationship between the Node.js API and popular web application packages. Each
    chapter explains how a core feature required for web development can be implemented
    using the Node.js API, before replacing the custom implementation with a popular
    and well-tested open-source package.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Understanding the Node.js API gives you a solid understanding of how web application
    features really work, and using popular packages lets you build those features
    without having to write custom code. When problems arise, as they will in any
    project, your knowledge of the Node.js API will give you a solid foundation to
    demystify the way that specific packages work and to figure out what’s going wrong.

- en: There are *loads* of examples. The best way to learn is by example, and I have
    packed as many of them into this book as I can. To maximize the number of examples
    in this book, I have adopted a simple convention to avoid listing the same code
    or content repeatedly. When I create a file, I will show its full contents, just
    as I have in *Listing 1.1*. I include the name of the file and its folder in the
    listing’s header, and I show the changes that I have made in bold.

    of the listing or the purpose of the file; just be aware that this type of listing

    to follow the example are shown in bold.

    a small change. Rather than list the complete file, I use an ellipsis (three periods
    in succession) to indicate a partial listing, which shows just a portion of the
    file, as shown in *Listing 1.2*.

    Most problems are caused by skipping a step or not fully applying the changes
