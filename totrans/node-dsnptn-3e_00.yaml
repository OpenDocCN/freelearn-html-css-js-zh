  zh: 前言
- en: Node.js is considered by many a game-changer—possibly the biggest innovation
    of the decade in web development. It is loved not just for its technical capabilities,
    but also for the paradigm shift that it introduced in web development and, in
    general, in the software development ecosystem.

  zh: Node.js被许多人视为变革者——可能是本世纪网络开发领域最大的创新。它不仅因其技术能力而受到喜爱，还因为它在Web开发以及整个软件开发生态系统中引入的范式转变。
- en: First, Node.js applications are written in JavaScript, the most adopted language
    on the web and the only programming language supported natively by every web browser.
    This aspect enables scenarios such as single-language application stacks and the
    sharing of code between the server and the client. A single language also helps
    to reduce the gap between frontend and backend engineers, making backend programming
    extremely approachable and intuitive for frontend developers. Once you are acquainted
    with Node.js and JavaScript, you can easily build software for a wide variety
    of platforms and contexts.

  zh: 首先，Node.js应用程序是用JavaScript编写的，这是网络上最广泛使用的语言，也是每个网络浏览器原生支持的唯一编程语言。这一特性使得单语言应用程序堆栈和服务器与客户端之间的代码共享成为可能。使用单一语言也有助于缩小前端和后端工程师之间的差距，使得后端编程对前端开发者来说极其易于接近和直观。一旦你熟悉了Node.js和JavaScript，你就可以轻松地为各种平台和环境构建软件。
- en: Node.js itself is contributing to the rise and evolution of the JavaScript language.
    People realize that using JavaScript on the server brings a lot of value, and
    they are loving it for its pragmatism, for its flexibility, its event-driven approach,
    and for its hybrid nature, halfway between object-oriented and functional programming.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: Node.js本身正推动JavaScript语言的崛起和演变。人们意识到在服务器上使用JavaScript带来了很多价值，他们喜欢它的实用主义、灵活性、事件驱动的方法以及它介于面向对象和函数式编程之间的混合特性。
- en: The second revolutionizing factor is Node.js' single-threaded programming model
    and its asynchronous architecture. Besides obvious advantages from a performance
    and scalability point of view, this characteristic changed the way developers
    approach concurrency and parallelism. Mutexes are replaced by queues, threads
    by callbacks, and synchronization by causality. These abstractions are generally
    simpler to adopt than their traditional counterparts, but they are still extremely
    powerful, allowing developers to be very productive while solving day-to-day challenges.

  zh: 第二个革命性因素是Node.js的单线程编程模型和其异步架构。从性能和可扩展性的角度来看，这一特性带来了明显的优势，同时也改变了开发者处理并发和并行的方式。互斥锁被队列取代，线程被回调函数取代，同步被因果关系取代。这些抽象通常比它们的传统对应物更容易采用，但它们仍然非常强大，允许开发者解决日常挑战时非常高效。
- en: 'The last and most important aspect of Node.js lies in its ecosystem: the npm
    package manager, its constantly growing database of modules, its enthusiastic
    and helpful community, and most importantly, its very own culture based on simplicity,
    pragmatism, and extreme modularity.'
  id: totrans-5

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: Node.js的最后一个也是最重要的方面在于其生态系统：npm包管理器，其不断增长的模块数据库，其热情和乐于助人的社区，最重要的是，其基于简单性、实用性和极端模块化的独特文化。
- en: 'However, because of these peculiarities, Node.js development gives you a very
    different feel compared to other server-side platforms, and any developer new
    to this paradigm will often feel unsure about how to tackle even the most common
    design and coding problems effectively. Common questions include: *How do I organize
    my code? What''s the best way to design this? How can I make my application more
    modular? How do I handle a set of asynchronous calls effectively? How can I make
    sure that my application will not collapse while it grows?* Or more simply, *what''s
    the right way to implement this?* Fortunately, Node.js has become a mature enough
    platform and most of these questions can now be easily answered with a design
    pattern, a proven coding technique, or a recommended practice. The aim of this
    book is to guide you through this emerging world of patterns, techniques, and
    practices, showing you what the proven solutions to the most common problems are
    and teaching you how to use them as the starting point to building the solution
    to your particular problem.'
