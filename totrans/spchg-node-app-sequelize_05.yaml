- en: ORM typically provides a way for us to be able to transform states, or objects,
    throughout events that occur when executing certain operations. These methods
    are often referred to as hooks, lifecycle events, object lifecycles, or even callbacks
    (the latter is *not* often used within the Node.js community due to a nomenclature
    conflict against Node.js’ native environment). Usually, these methods have a temporal
    prefix (for example, `before` and `after`) preceding an event’s name.

    validation, save, create, update, and destroy. Other ORM frameworks offer a wider
    scope of events or more granular control, such as before/after connecting to your
    database, defining your models, and calling a finder query.'

    defining default lifecycle events for every model, enforce events (referred to
    as permanent hooks in Sequelize), and connection-related events. The local hooks
    entail lifecycle events defined on models for instances/records.

    The first action could be adding a `beforeValidate` hook that would set the transaction’s
    subtotal to `0` if the user was an employee. That’s easy for us, but unfortunately
    a nightmare for the accounting department. A better approach would be to add an
    additional item that represents the employee discount, using the `beforeValidate`
    or `beforeCreate` hook.

    requirements. From our previous example, some transactions require moving legal
    tender, which involves charging the employee and then providing a refund/credit
    as a separate transaction. In this case, we would not be able to use `beforeValidate`
    nor `beforeCreate`, but `afterCreate` could be applicable. Under the context of
    Sequelize, knowing where to place your code’s logic is knowing the order of operations
    for lifecycle events.

    offers a `transaction` parameter when calling certain methods, such as `update`,
