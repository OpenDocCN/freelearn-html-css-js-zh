    Bostock's blog article, *Towards Reusable Charts*, at [http://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/).
    At its core, it sets out to implement charts as closures with `getter` and `setter`
    methods. This makes the code more readable and simple for testing. It is actually
    a great idea to read this article before continuing, as we can take some of our
    career experiences and extend these concepts a little further. The project structure
    is organized to achieve several goals.

    or logic that must be applied to incoming data. There are two notable best practices
    we can leverage to test and validate these operations. They are explained in the
    following sections.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Keeping methods/functions small
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Small functions mean low cyclomatic complexity. This means there are fewer logic
    branches in each function and, therefore, fewer things to test. If we test each
    simple function thoroughly and independently, then there will be fewer chances
    of things going wrong when we compose them together into larger complex computations.
    A good guideline is to try and keep methods at around 10 lines of code.
