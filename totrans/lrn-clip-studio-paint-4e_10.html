<h1 class="chapterTitle" id="_idParaDest-182">Exploring Vector Layers</h1>
<p class="normal">One of the benefits of using Clip Studio Paint is that it can produce both raster and vector images. In fact, rasters and vectors can be used on different layers of the same canvas by simply creating the corresponding layer type. Creating vectors in Clip Studio Paint, however, is different in many ways compared to other vector programs.</p>
<p class="normal">Vector images are different from raster images. Raster images are made up of small squares of color, called pixels. Raster images are used in many situations, but they do have some disadvantages – primarily that since they are composed of pixels, they lose quality when made larger. Vector images are made of points that are connected together in the program and can be edited on the fly and resized at will without any loss in quality.</p>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we will learn both how to create vectors in Clip Studio Paint and how to save artwork to the <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> palette for use again later. The following topics will be covered:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Creating a vector layer</li>
<li class="bulletList">Drawing on vector layers</li>
<li class="bulletList">Editing vectors</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">By the end of this chapter, you will know how to deal with vector line drawing and will have gained knowledge of using materials.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s get started with vectors!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-183">Technical requirements</h1>
<p class="normal">To get started, you need Clip Studio Paint already installed on your device, and a new canvas opened with a white-colored paper layer. Any size is fine, but I recommend creating a 300-dpi square canvas with which to work through the content in this chapter.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-184">Vectors in Clip Studio Paint</h1>
<p class="normal">In this section, we <a id="_idIndexMarker759"/>will start by learning about vectors, so don’t <a id="_idIndexMarker760"/>worry if you are new to the term. We will start with what they’re all about, and then you will try creating some vector art with our step-by-step tutorials.</p>
<p class="normal">Vector images are made from points, lines, and curves that are based on mathematical expressions. Because these images are defined by mathematical expressions instead of pixels, they can be scaled up or down infinitely without losing quality or becoming pixelated.</p>
<p class="normal">Vectors are most often used for logos, but they can be useful to create comics as well as illustrations. The lines can be adjusted without being redrawn, so if you have trouble confidently making lines for inking, then working with vectors may be a solution for you.</p>
<p class="normal">Some graphics software will only work with either vector or raster information. Clip Studio Paint can do both, even within the same image file. We can have one layer of the image filled with vector information while all the others are filled with raster information if that’s the way we want to do our work!</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">NOTE</strong></p>
<p class="normal">It’s worth noting here that if you are already familiar with working with vectors in another program, you may need to adjust to the way that Clip Studio Paint handles vector graphics. Also, Clip Studio Paint’s vectors are not exportable from the program as vectors, and vector graphics from other programs cannot be imported as vectors into Clip Studio Paint.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Let’s get<a id="_idIndexMarker761"/> into <a id="_idIndexMarker762"/>creating your vector art!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-185">Creating a vector layer</h1>
<p class="normal">To start working<a id="_idIndexMarker763"/> with vectors, we need to create a vector layer. There are two ways to do this: through the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu or through the <strong class="screenText">Layer </strong>palette. We will look at these methods in the following sections.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-186">Creating a vector layer via the File menu</h2>
<p class="normal">Follow these <a id="_idIndexMarker764"/>steps to create a vector layer <a id="_idIndexMarker765"/>using the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">In the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu, click on <strong class="screenText">File</strong>, then go to <strong class="screenText">New Layer</strong>, and finally click on <strong class="screenText">Vector Layer</strong>.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Enter a name for the layer in the <strong class="screenText">New vector layer</strong> dialog box that appears.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Choose an <strong class="screenText">Expression Color</strong> (<strong class="screenText">Black</strong> and <strong class="screenText">White</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Gray</strong>, or <strong class="screenText">Color</strong>) from the drop-down menu in the <strong class="screenText">New vector layer</strong> dialog box.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on <strong class="screenText">OK</strong> to create the new layer.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">We will see how to create a vector layer from the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette in the next section.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-187">Creating a vector layer via the Layer palette</h2>
<p class="normal">Follow these<a id="_idIndexMarker766"/> steps to create a vector <a id="_idIndexMarker767"/>layer using the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Locate the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette in the user interface.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on the <strong class="screenText">New vector layer</strong> icon in the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette. The icon is pointed out with an arrow in the screenshot on the right:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_10_10.1.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.1: Screenshot of the Layer palette</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="3">The new layer will be created and will show up in the layer stack in the palette.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">Anything drawn on a vector layer will be a vector image, meaning that it is not made up of pixels, but of control points. Now we know two methods for creating a vector layer. They can be created either from the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu or from the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette. The second method is definitely easier since it’s just a click on an icon!</p>
<p class="normal">In the next section, we <a id="_idIndexMarker768"/>will learn how to draw on a <a id="_idIndexMarker769"/>vector layer with our favorite tools.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-188">Drawing on vector layers</h1>
<p class="normal">Once you have <a id="_idIndexMarker770"/>created a vector layer, you can use any tool that you’d like to draw on it, including pencils, pens, or the direct drawing tools (line, curve, ellipse, and so on).</p>
<p class="normal">Some editing may be needed to create a smooth line, and we prefer a line with the fewest control points possible to make it easier to edit the line.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s look at two similar vector lines, as shown in the screenshot on the right:</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_10_10.2.png"/></p>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.2: Two vector lines</p>
<p class="normal">The line at the top was created using the <strong class="screenText">Continuous Curve</strong> tool. The line at the bottom was created using the <strong class="screenText">Pen</strong> tool. The small circles shown along each line are the control points that are used for editing vector lines. On the line that was created with the <strong class="screenText">Continuous Curve</strong> tool, nine control points are shown at each point where the curve changes direction.</p>
<p class="normal">The line created by drawing a curve with the <strong class="screenText">Pen</strong> tool has many more control points because Clip Studio Paint automatically places them wherever the program thinks they may be needed. This makes editing the vector lines more difficult without some extra work beforehand.</p>
<p class="normal">Thankfully, Clip Studio <a id="_idIndexMarker771"/>Paint provides us with tools to make the cleanup process easier, which is exactly what we’ll explore in the next section.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-189">Editing vectors</h1>
<p class="normal">In this section, we <a id="_idIndexMarker772"/>are going to look at different ways to edit vector lines. First of all, we will get to know editing tools, then we will try out some tools on the vector lines that we created in the previous section. Finally, we will learn how to change line widths.</p>
<p class="normal">One of the advantages of using vector graphics is that lines can be tweaked and edited endlessly until they are perfect, unlike working with raster layers, where a line must be erased and redrawn until it’s just right. Vector lines can be manipulated and reshaped using their control points.</p>
<p class="normal">Clip Studio Paint has tools that allow for the easy cleanup and editing of vector lines. These tools can be found in the <strong class="screenText">Correct line</strong> group of tools, as shown in the screenshot on the right:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_10_10.3.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.3: Screenshot of the Correct line sub-tool options</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s take a closer <a id="_idIndexMarker773"/>look at some of these <strong class="screenText">Correct line</strong> tools, what they do, and how we can use them.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-190">Using the Pinch vector line tool</h2>
<p class="normal">I think it’s best<a id="_idIndexMarker774"/> to talk about this tool first, because <a id="_idIndexMarker775"/>using <strong class="keyWord">Pinch vector line</strong> is an easy way to make a small change to the line position. Click on this tool, then click on the line you want to move and drag it around to the desired place. As you can see, the <strong class="keyWord">Pinch vector line</strong> icon shows a circle pinching a line. It’s that easy – if you only need to make a small tweak, this is the tool you need!</p>
<p class="normal">For example, in the screenshot on the right, I wanted to add more curve to the guitar outline behind the character. So, I used the <strong class="screenText">Pinch vector line</strong> tool to edit the line retroactively:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A cartoon of a fish  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_10_10.4.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.4: Screenshot of the Pinch vector line sample</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s have a look at its settings.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_10_10.5.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.5: Screenshot of the Pinch vector line sub-tool settings</p>
<p class="normal">The settings of the <strong class="screenText">Pinch vector line</strong> tool options are described as follows (and are shown in the screenshot on the right):</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Fix end</strong>: This sets which <a id="_idIndexMarker776"/>ends of the pinched line to edit. If you select the <strong class="screenText">Fix one end</strong> option, as highlighted in the screenshot, you can move one end of the line but not the other.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Pinch level</strong>: This option adjusts how much the line bends when editing with this tool. Bigger values pinch the whole line while smaller values pinch a smaller part of the line.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Effect range</strong>: This adjusts the extent of the line affected when you drag along the line. The larger the value, the more the part of the line is moved at once.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Add control point</strong>: When activated, this automatically adds control points as you bend a line so that the parts without control points are not dragged along as you edit. When it’s not activated, a whole line will be dragged as it is, so the drawing shape might be distorted.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Connect lines</strong>: When activated, if you pinch one line and move it to touch the end of another line, these lines will be connected. You won’t be able to activate this if you select the <strong class="screenText">Fix both ends</strong> option in the <strong class="screenText">Fix end</strong> setting.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Now you know how to control the <strong class="screenText">Pinch vector line</strong> tool, so you can adjust your vector lines as you<a id="_idIndexMarker777"/> please using this tool! We<a id="_idIndexMarker778"/> will now look at some different ways of editing vectors in the next section.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-191">Using the Control point tool</h2>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="keyWord">Control point</strong> sub-tool <a id="_idIndexMarker779"/>can be used to<a id="_idIndexMarker780"/> perform various actions on the control points along a vector line. These functions can be accessed via the <strong class="screenText">sub-tool property</strong> palette when the <strong class="screenText">Control point</strong> sub-tool is selected. The screenshot on the left shows the <strong class="screenText">sub-tool property</strong> palette:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_10_10.6.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.6: Screenshot of the Control point sub-tool property palette</p>
<p class="normal">The<a id="_idIndexMarker781"/> different <a id="_idIndexMarker782"/>modes of the <strong class="screenText">Control point</strong> tool are described as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Move control points</strong>: Allows<a id="_idIndexMarker783"/> the control point to be moved by clicking and dragging.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Add control point</strong>: Adds a control point by clicking on the vector line at the point where the additional control point should be placed.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Delete control point</strong>: Deletes control points with a click.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Switch corner</strong>: Switches the corner of the control point. Control points can be hard corners or curves, and using this tool will change a hard corner on a vector line into a curve, and vice versa.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Adjust line width</strong>: Easily manipulate the width of the vector line by clicking and dragging to the right or left on a control point. Dragging in either direction will either make the line thinner or thicker at that control point. <em class="italic">Figure 10.7</em> shows sample lines of the same line width after dragging the stylus from left to right, and right to left, respectively:</li>
</ul>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A black and red curved object  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_10_10.7.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.7: Screenshots of Adjust line width in action</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Adjust opacity</strong>: This is similar to the <strong class="screenText">Correct line width</strong> option and allows us to change the opacity of the line at the control point by clicking and dragging. It works great when you don’t want a solid thick line edge. <em class="italic">Figure 10.8</em> are before and after using <strong class="screenText">Adjust opacity</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A black and red curved road  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_10_10.8.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.8: Screenshots of before and after using Adjust opacity</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Split line</strong>: Separates<a id="_idIndexMarker784"/> the vector line at the point where the tool is clicked.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">By <a id="_idIndexMarker785"/>switching<a id="_idIndexMarker786"/> back and forth between these options, you get a great level of control for manipulating your vector lines! But aren’t there too many control points? We will see how to simplify this in the following section.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-192">Using the Simplify vector line tool</h2>
<p class="normal">This is the tool <a id="_idIndexMarker787"/>that I use the most when <a id="_idIndexMarker788"/>creating vector graphics in Clip Studio Paint. I love the look of hand-inked lines for most of my art, especially lines that go from thin to thick and back again, like they were made using a traditional brush pen. However, as seen in the <em class="italic">Drawing on vector layers</em> section of this chapter, using the drawing tools on a vector layer produces a line with an abundance of control points, making editing the line difficult.</p>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="keyWord">Simplify vector line</strong> tool can be used to reduce the number of control points in a hand-drawn line to only the points needed. The line in the screenshot on the right has had the <strong class="keyWord">Simplify vector line</strong> tool used on the left-hand side, while the right still has the control points that were created automatically:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_10_10.9.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.9: Screenshot of a half-simplified line</p>
<p class="normal">Notice how close together the control points are on the right side of the curve compared to the control points on the left. This is because Clip Studio Paint puts too many control points along vector lines when they are drawn with a pen or a brush tool.</p>
<p class="normal">Using the <strong class="keyWord">Simplify vector line</strong> tool is easy. Simply select the tool, set the brush size, and then click and drag it over the areas of the vector line that need to be simplified. A green highlight shows where you’ve already used the tool during that stroke. When the mouse button is released, the program will simplify the line automatically.</p>
<p class="normal">Note that after using this tool, some control points may need slight tweaking for accuracy. Now <a id="_idIndexMarker789"/>your vector line looks <a id="_idIndexMarker790"/>simplified and more manageable. Let’s move on to learn how to change the line width.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-193">Using the Correct line width tool</h2>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="keyWord">Correct line width</strong> sub-tool<a id="_idIndexMarker791"/> under<a id="_idIndexMarker792"/> the <strong class="keyWord">Correct line</strong> group allows for a vector’s line width to be changed in an instant. This is only one of the tools that allow us to change the width of a line. Let’s take a look at the <strong class="keyWord">Correct line width</strong> sub-tool properties, which are shown in the screenshot on the right:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_10_10.10.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.10: Screenshot of Correct line width sub-tool property</p>
<p class="normal">The white circle to the left of the option name indicates which operation is currently active: </p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Thicken:</strong> This will make the vector line thicker, depending on what value the slider is currently on and where the tool is used.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Narrow:</strong> This does the opposite, making the vector line thinner. If you click the small <strong class="screenText">+</strong> icon next to it, it tells you it should be at least 1 pixel to reduce the width.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Scale up width</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Scale down width:</strong> Make the line thicker and narrower by scaling it up or down, according to the value set under those options. This means if you input <strong class="screenText">2</strong> in the <strong class="screenText">Scale up width</strong> value, the part of the vector line where the tool is used will become two times thicker.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">The outline<a id="_idIndexMarker793"/> in the screenshot on the right has thickened using<a id="_idIndexMarker794"/> this tool. You can see how this is helpful for certain styles, or if you just want to add more emphasis to your character!</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_10_10.11.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.11: Screenshot of a drawing with line width corrected</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Fix width</strong>: Sets any part of the line the tool is used on to the width indicated by the slider, no matter how thick or thin it is before being used.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Process whole line</strong>: The checkbox will complete the indicated action on the entire vector line at once. This can be a great time-saver when wanting to make an entire line thicker or narrower, because one click anywhere along the line will change the whole line at once, instead of us needing to select the entire line with the tool!</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Brush Size</strong>: Its<a id="_idIndexMarker795"/> slider controls<a id="_idIndexMarker796"/> the size of the cursor of the <strong class="screenText">Correct line width</strong> tool.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-194">Using the Redraw vector line tool</h2>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="keyWord">Redraw vector line</strong> sub-tool <a id="_idIndexMarker797"/>is pretty <a id="_idIndexMarker798"/>neat because it allows you to push and pull the vector line around as you like. Simply select the tool, click somewhere along a vector line, and drag it around to change the line. It’s an easy way to adjust vector lines quickly and organically without having to completely redraw them! In an earlier section, we learned about the <strong class="screenText">Pinch vector line</strong> tool, used to make simple adjustments to vector lines. The tools are quite similar realistically, but this one is generally more handy for complicated shape line adjustment.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-195">Using the Redraw vector line width tool</h2>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="keyWord">Redraw vector line width</strong> sub-tool is another method of adjusting the thickness or<a id="_idIndexMarker799"/> thinness of <a id="_idIndexMarker800"/>our vector lines after they’ve been created. Honestly, this is the tool I tend to use the most when needing to adjust vector line thickness, simply because it is much more visual than the <strong class="keyWord">Correct line width</strong> tool. The <strong class="keyWord">Redraw vector line width</strong> sub-tool uses the <strong class="screenText">Brush Size</strong> setting to adjust the thickness of the line. The larger the brush size is set, the thicker the tool will make the parts of the line it is used on. When the brush is set to a size smaller than the current line, the tool will make the line narrower. In the screenshot on the right, this tool was used with varying size settings along the length of the line:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_10_10.12.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.12: Screenshots of drawings edited with the Redraw line width tool</p>
<p class="normal">Whatever size the brush was set to is the size that the line becomes after the tool is used. The Chain decoration pen line was created by making the brush size much, much larger than the current width. This was done by tracing just once on that section of the line.</p>
<p class="normal">That’s how we<a id="_idIndexMarker801"/> can change the<a id="_idIndexMarker802"/> width of lines to suit our needs. We will look at how to make two separate vector lines connect in the following section, so let’s read on.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-196">Using the Connect vector line tool</h2>
<p class="normal">If you see that<a id="_idIndexMarker803"/> there’s a gap between<a id="_idIndexMarker804"/> two vector lines that you want to fill, this is the tool for you. You only need to stroke the tool over the line gap and it will be filled automatically! As with the other tools, there are several settings available for this tool, as you can see in the following screenshot:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_10_10.13.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.13: Screenshot of the Connect vector line sub-tool properties</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s have a look at<a id="_idIndexMarker805"/> each of these <a id="_idIndexMarker806"/>settings in the sub-tool properties:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Simplify</strong>: Reduces the number of control points in the area where you stroke to connect the lines. As you can see in the following screenshot, a smaller value makes the lines connect with a more complicated shape, and a larger value makes the connection with a simpler shape:</li>
</ul>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_10_10.14.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.14: Screenshot of the Connect vector sub-tool’s Simplify property</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Connect lines</strong>: This option, when activated, connects overlapping lines into a single one. The larger the value, the more lines can be connected. Be careful not to set this value too high, otherwise some unintended connections might happen.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Brush Size</strong>: This sets the size of the brush.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Phew, seems like those were a lot of options to take in! But you can now move, add, erase, and simplify control points, and you can even change line width without having to redraw the line again and again. Because they’re vectors, your lines also won’t lose quality when you increase the size of the canvas. So, now you’re familiar with the <strong class="screenText">Pinch vector line</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Control point</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Correct line width</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Redraw vector line</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Connect vector line</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Redraw vector line width</strong> tools, and know how they work!</p>
<p class="normal">Did you <a id="_idIndexMarker807"/>make<a id="_idIndexMarker808"/> a mistake or just want to hide parts of a vector line? No problem, read on to find out how to erase a vector line.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-197">Using the Vector eraser tool</h2>
<p class="normal">Back in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="italic">Erasers, Selections, and the Sub View Palette</em>, I mentioned that we would <a id="_idIndexMarker809"/>talk about the <strong class="screenText">Vector eraser</strong> in a later<a id="_idIndexMarker810"/> chapter. Now, that time has arrived!</p>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Vector eraser</strong> can be used just like a regular eraser, but it also has some settings that turn it into an incredible time-saving device when working with vectors. Let’s take a closer look at these settings now, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_10_10.15.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.15: Screenshot of the Vector eraser tool properties</p>
<p class="normal">Take special note of the <strong class="screenText">Vector eraser</strong> section of the <strong class="screenText">Tool property </strong>palette. This special setting <a id="_idIndexMarker811"/>is what makes the <strong class="screenText">Vector eraser</strong> tool so special among the other eraser tools. In the screenshot on the left, we can see three icons, each accompanied by a black and blue <strong class="screenText">+</strong> sign. These icons are <strong class="screenText">Erase touched areas</strong>,</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A white cross on a gray background  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_10_10.16.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.16: Screenshot of Erase touched areas icon</p>
<p class="normal"><strong class="screenText">Erase up to intersection</strong>,</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A white cross on a grey background  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_10_10.17.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.17: Screenshot of Erase up to intersection icon</p>
<p class="normal">and <strong class="screenText">Whole line</strong>.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_10_10.18.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.18: Screenshot of Erase Whole line icon</p>
<p class="normal">To illustrate what each of these settings does, a simple grid of straight lines on a vector layer will assist us.</p>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Erase touched areas</strong> option will erase only what is gone over with the tool, just like any of the other eraser tools will do normally. In the following screenshot, this <a id="_idIndexMarker812"/>setting was used, and then a stroke was taken down through the grid of lines <a id="_idIndexMarker813"/>with it. Only the sections of the lines that the tool passed through were erased:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_10_10.19.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 10.19: Erase touched areas action</p>
<p class="normal">Using the <strong class="screenText">Erase up to intersection</strong> option allows us to clean up a grid of lines quickly and easily. This setting will erase the vector line up to the point where it intersects with another vector line. In the screenshot on the left, it was used to make one stroke down through the third column of the grid. Note that, unlike the previous option, all of the horizontal lines from that section have disappeared, despite the fact that the tool only moved through the center of the lines in the column:</p>

<p class="normal">This setting can be used to quickly clean up the edges of the grid in the preceding screenshot. One<a id="_idIndexMarker814"/> swipe around the edges of the grid of squares and stray lines are erased<a id="_idIndexMarker815"/> entirely, up to where they intersect with other vector lines, as shown in the screenshot on the right:</p>

<p class="normal">Instead of tediously erasing the ends of the lines and trying desperately to get them perfect, the <strong class="screenText">Erase up to intersection</strong> tool does it for you with one stroke. You can utilize it in your art, such as on strokes on fringes of hair and lines on face outlines, as in the<a id="_idIndexMarker816"/> sample art on the left:</p>

<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Whole line</strong> setting will erase the entirety of the vector line that is clicked on, no matter how <a id="_idIndexMarker817"/>small of a brush size the eraser tool is set to. In the screenshot on the right, this setting was used on two horizontal grid lines to make a set of rectangles instead of squares:</p>

<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-198">Summary</h1>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we started off by getting familiar with vectors. We learned what a vector is and how vectors in Clip Studio Paint differ from vectors in other programs. We learned how to create a vector layer and how to draw on it with both the direct drawing tools and the brush tools. Finally, we learned about the different tools we can use to fine-tune our vector drawings.</p>
<p class="normal">You now know how to use raster and vector layers. Did you know that you can also create your own sound effects in Clip Studio Paint? In the next chapter, we’ll learn about editing, modifying, coloring, and wrapping up text, while also getting creative by adding sound effects.</p>
