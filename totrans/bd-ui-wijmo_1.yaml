    in the cache. If the user already has a cached version on his machine, then the
    browser loads from the cache instead of downloading the content. Serving jQuery
    over CDN will likely reduce the download size for the user. However, the Wijmo
    and jQuery UI libraries are less frequently used in web development so they are
    not likely to be cached. Instead of loading the full libraries from a CDN, creating
    a custom download with only the components used in your project, as covered in
    the next section, reduces the size. As a result, your web application will load
    faster.

    using a CDN, since jQuery UI has many releases each year and the chances of your
    project using the same version that the browser has already downloaded is low.
    For this book, download jQuery UI 1.10.2 with the default options. Later on, you
    will want to unselect the features that you don't use and see if your project

    When a component is enabled, its dependencies are automatically selected. As you
    minimize your files for production, keep in mind that most of the effects along
    with some interactions and widgets may not be necessary. For example, only the
    **slide effect** is used in the accordion and dialog widgets. If your project
    only uses these widgets, then the other effects are not necessary.
