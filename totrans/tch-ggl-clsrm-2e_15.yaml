    and online. When there was a spike in cases, all the students had to learn from
    home for a month. One of my students was apprehensive because of their poor online
    learning experience earlier in the pandemic.

    they cheerfully responded that my class felt no different, online or in-person.
    During a new term with students both online and in-person, several of my in-person
    students chose to attend online for the same reasons. These interactions with
    my students constantly reinforce my beliefs that online learning can be as effective

    (Don't worry, I'm not about to recommend that you purchase a brand-new computer.)
    With more laptops than desktops at home, another common trend is to use Wi-Fi
    to connect computers to the internet. However, because Wi-Fi does not use a physical
    connection, it is susceptible to interference.

    the more devices that are connected to the internet through Wi-Fi, the more each
    device has to share the data rate of the Wi-Fi signal. Therefore, to ensure that
    you have a more stable connection to the internet, you should connect your computer
    to the internet through a physical connection. Most internet service providers
    loan out internet routers, which have Ethernet ports in the back to physically
    connect devices:'

    entertainment in a movie. Oftentimes, it is easier to watch a low-quality video
    with crisp audio rather than a high-quality video with crackly audio. Therefore,
    using a good quality microphone is more important (and thankfully cheaper) than

    picks up your voice louder than other things, such as your keyboard, while also
    preventing you from blowing air into the mic when you''re saying *P* and *T* words:'

    cameras and smartphones having the camera flash pointing directly at the object
    being photographed, as we mentioned in the previous paragraph, having a light

    spreads the light coming from the bulb. Without the shade, the lamp would create
    brighter, harsher light.

    lights can cost thousands of dollars for just a single light. Those expensive
    lights are most likely not needed, and amateur or prosumer lights will be more
    than adequate. Online retailers such as Amazon have lighting kits containing two
    lights, soft box diffusers, and stands for $150 USD. If space is limited, the
    Elgato Key light is a great all-in-one solution that attaches to your desk.

    also draw power from the USB connection or may use a battery coupler, often called

    a camera as a webcam, consider its uses when you're not teaching. Since I have
    a 3-year-old, purchasing a GoPro and, later, a mirrorless camera means that I

    to release information at the same time every day. When I taught an online asynchronous
    class, my students knew that every day at 3:00 P.M., the lesson would be released
    on Google Classroom. They became so familiar with that time that my students would
    flood my email inbox at 3:15 P.M., asking if there was no new video. Furthermore,
    each day had an **Assignment** post or a discussion question (via the **Announcement**
    post containing the video's class comments section) for the students to respond
    to the video.

    into personal time without boundaries. I have heard many stories from online teachers
    where students will email during all hours of the day, expecting an immediate
    response. What can exacerbate this situation is that, without clear expectations,
    parents can also expect an on-call availability from the teacher. Therefore, it
    is important to communicate and have a student support system early in the school
    year to avoid these problems.

    post for students to ask questions about the lecture. Then, when I recorded the

    is that you still have a record of the questions that were unanswered. You can
    then address those questions later in the lesson.

    if the questions are urgent. I also know teachers who have evening hours, where
    they will respond to student emails too. Whatever method you decide, if students

    advantages and disadvantages of online assessment tools.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This year, many of my math and science colleagues have created new assessments
    for the online environment. The primary reason for these new exams is because
    the in-person exams they used to use took years to develop. With countless hours
    being spent creating questions, blueprinting exams to the curriculum, and then
    fine tuning and publishing those exams online was not possible. There are many
    ways to screenshot, screen record, or simply write down questions while completing
    a high-stakes exam. Then, those well-crafted in-person exams would no longer be
    secure. Students can then distribute the questions through various social media
    channels.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A possible alternative to high-stakes exams is to adjust exam weightings and
    create several medium-to-low stakes assessments. Some online teachers have moved
    to 20- or 30-minute weekly quizzes that comprise the bulk of the exam rather than
    one or two high-stakes exams. Students are less likely to distribute the questions
    because they have access to the questions for less time and it is easier to create
    different versions of smaller quizzes. With this solution, I have seen course
    weightings invert from 20% Quizzes, 50% Unit Exams, 30% Other to 50% Quizzes,
    20% Unit Exams, 30% Other. This format adapts well to online courses that organize
    with a weekly calendar too.

    Project-based learning involves students in the synthesis process of learning.
    Oftentimes, the project produces a product that is difficult to plagiarize. Some
    project examples include video shorts and video essays. Video shorts are 1-to-3-minute
    videos where students explain a topic or concept. In subjects such as math or
    science, each student can be assigned a different calculation problem to complete.
  prefs: []

    library of video tutorials. Video essays are longer videos that can replace a
    written essay; however, they require more technical skills from the students.
    Video shorts can be easily created by recording a Google Meet, using a phone camera,
    or using free online tools such as Screencastify. For video editing features,
    they can use WeVideo, a free online video editor.

    Having a time limit is not necessarily a disadvantage because you still have to

    live presentations with Google Slides through Google Meet is another solution.

    are still some strategies you can utilize to mitigate cheating. For the exam structure,
    consider open book exams with a narrow time limit. Then, the time limit – not
    the lack of resources – contributes to the authenticity of the assessment. This
    is the structure I have adapted for my online students with success. Additionally,
    another strategy for improving the authenticity of assessments is having students
    sign into Google Meet with a secondary device, such as a phone.
  prefs: []

- en: The student places the device beside them so that their field of view includes
    their monitor, keyboard, face, and hands. On that device, the students also unmute
    their microphones. This setup allows you to have a better view of what the student
    is doing while taking the exam, and it also allows the students to see and hear
    you without having to put on a headset. If your students are writing an in-class
    paper using Google Docs, you can view their Google Doc and their camera at the
    same time if you are suspicious of their activities during an exam.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One final strategy for high-stakes exams is to regularly ask students to perform
    tasks throughout. Some examples include touching the top of their head, clapping,
    standing up and sitting down, taking a 10-second stretch break, and so on. Asking
    the students to move around at random times ensures that they are not using a
    video recording as the webcam's source. Free software is available for users to
    use a video to mimic a webcam. Therefore, a student could pre-record themselves
    *writing an exam* and then play it while taking an actual exam, freeing the student
    to do whatever they want during the exam.

    can be defeated with relative ease. The simplest method any student can use is
    simply asking to use the washroom during an exam. Not even expensive invigilation
    software or proctoring services can guarantee authenticity in online assessment.
    Therefore, adapting assessment practices for an online environment has a greater
    likelihood of accurately quantifying student understanding than holding them tightly
    to traditional assessment practices.

    confiscate it; during exams, the classroom is a secure location. Transitioning
    to an online environment brings forth many challenges to the learning environment
    that were non-issues in an in-person classroom. Therefore, be gracious to yourself.

    the several additional facets that teaching online brings to pedagogy. In general,
