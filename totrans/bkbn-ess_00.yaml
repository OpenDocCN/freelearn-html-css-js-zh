- en: We JavaScript developers live in exciting times. Every month we're presented
    with an incredible new browser feature, open source library, or software methodology
    that promises to vastly improve on whatever came before it. And then, just as
    soon as one new technology arrives, another almost inevitably follows it, promising
    still further innovation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Amid this ever-changing landscape of new technologies only a very few libraries
    manage to stay not just relevant but essential over a long period of time, despite
    having newer challengers. For many web programmers jQuery was the first such library,
    but in recent years another library has proven itself to be similarly indispensable.
    That library is Backbone.

- en: Backbone offers developers a wide range of foundational pieces from which they
    can build any manner of web application. From its simple yet flexible class system,
    to its event-based and AJAX-simplifying data containers, to its DOM manipulation
    and single-page user-facing components, Backbone provides everything needed to
    form the underlying framework of a site.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, at first Backbone's incredible power and flexibility can be intimidating.
    When faced with over a hundred different methods spread across four base classes
    it can be challenging for a new Backbone developer to determine which ones to
    use and when. In addition, while Backbone is very "opinionated" about its core
    functions, it takes a deliberately agnostic approach to just about everything
    else. This allows developers to choose the perfect approach for their application,
    but at the same time all those choices can be daunting to someone unfamiliar with
    Backbone.

- en: In this book we offer two things, both drawn from years of experience using
    Backbone to create and maintain a real-world web-based application. First, we
    will provide you with an understanding of all of Backbone's essentials. By the
    time you complete this book, you will have learned everything you need to create
    powerful and maintainable web applications using Backbone.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But at the same time, in addition to just explaining Backbone itself, we'll
    also explain the wider, "meta" level of Backbone programming. From advice on how
    to implement important details of your classes, to examinations of how Backbone
    can be made even more powerful when connected to the larger JavaScript ecosystem,
    we have endeavored to not only show how to use Backbone, but how to use it well.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a web-based technology book, Backbone Essentials requires very little, only
    some form of text editor and web browser. Backbone itself is compatible with almost
    all browsers, including Internet Explorer 7 and up, though a modern web browser
    is recommended. Similarly, while you *can* write Backbone code using a plain text
    editor, we recommend instead using a modern IDE such as Sublime, Eclipse, or WebStorm,
    as it can provide many useful features to aid development.

    the library itself, which can be found at [http://www.backbonejs.com](http://www.backbonejs.com).
    In addition, you''ll also need to download Backbone''s two dependencies: jQuery
    ([http://www.jquery.com](http://www.jquery.com)) and Underscore ([http://www.underscorejs.org/](http://www.underscorejs.org/)).
    Technically only Underscore is required, but you''ll want jQuery also to be able
    to take advantage of Backbone''s View class.'

    excellent *Learning jQuery*, by Jonathan Chaffer, before starting this book. If
    you are completely new to web development, you would be better served by first
    familiarizing yourself with JavaScript through one of the many excellent free
    tutorials available on the web.
