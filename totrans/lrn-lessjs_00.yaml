- en: You know the scene—you've created a kick-ass website, but the client isn't happy
    with the color of the buttons you've used on the site. They say the color shades
    used aren't quite there and need tweaking. A reasonable request, right? Except
    that there are dozens of buttons throughout the site, with most of them using
    different colors…Oh heck… no chance of an early finish then…

- en: Or, is there? There is—what if we could change a handful of values and it automatically
    changes each button for you? Sounds crazy, right?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Wrong, it is absolutely possible. Welcome to the world of CSS preprocessors
    and Less! The power of Less means that we can set a couple of values that can
    be applied to any number of elements (such as buttons). Rather than having to
    change all of the buttons manually, we change the values and hit a button to recompile
    our code. Voilà! The code is instantly updated, and the buttons show the new color.

    apply its power to a number of real-world scenarios, such as updating buttons
    to build a complete theme for CMS systems, such as WordPress. We'll take a look
    at the subjects such as animating, color management, abstracting frameworks, and
    creating media queries for responsive sites.

- en: '[Chapter 1](part0018_split_000.html#page "Chapter 1. Introducing Less"), *Introducing
    Less*, takes us through the roles that both HTML and CSS play, and examines the
    inherent limitations of using CSS as a technology. We begin our journey by taking
    a look at the role CSS preprocessors play and how using Less can act as a solution
    for some of these limiting issues.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](part0025_split_000.html#page "Chapter 2. Building a Less Development
    Toolkit"), *Building a Less Development Toolkit*, is where we get to know Less
    for the first time, with a look at how we can incorporate it in our code, explore
    its syntax, and create some basic styles. We''ll take a look at the different
    ways of compiling Less into valid CSS and why it is best to precompile code rather
    than use it dynamically in the browser.'

    *Getting Started with Less*, delves into the wide range of tools and applications
    that are available and can be useful for working with Less; the chapter will provide
    some hints and tips on how to build an effective toolkit for working with Less,
    which you can integrate into your own development workflow.'

    from where we left off in [Chapter 2](part0025_split_000.html#page "Chapter 2. Building
    a Less Development Toolkit"), *Building a Less Development Toolkit*, with a look
    at one of the key concepts of Less, in the form of mixins. We''ll take a look
    at this incredibly powerful tool, which will help you to save a lot of time when
    developing Less; we will also cover how we can create variables and functions
    to create our CSS styling when working with Less.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](part0050_split_000.html#page "Chapter 5. Inheritance, Overriding,
    and Nesting in Less"), *Inheritance, Overriding, and Nesting in Less*, examines
    how, with a little forethought and careful design, we can use the power of Less
    to create new styles based on existing ones, but without the need to duplicate
    the existing code. We''ll also see how Less allows us to split style sheets into
    smaller, more manageable files, where we can group common styles together, making
    it easier to manage our development.'

    Less"), *Migrating Your Site to Less*, contains the answer to the question asked
    by many developers when starting with Less: how can I incorporate it into existing
    sites? We''ll take a look at some of the tips and tricks that we can use to gradually
    transition a site to use Less while still maintaining the existing CSS until it
    has been converted to its Less equivalent.'

    we can easily maintain any font style used within our site with the help of Less;
    we''ll see how, with a little care and planning, we can make minimal changes that
    will quickly update font styles throughout the whole site.'

    *Media Queries with Less*, takes a look at how we can use Less to quickly and
    effectively construct responsive sites using the power of media queries. We''ll
    take a brief look at how media queries work and then move on to take a look at
    how we need to set expectations with clients and decide what should be supported,
    before using Less to build our queries.'

    CMS"), *Working with Less in a CMS*, takes us through how Less can be used to
    great effect when managing styles for any content management system available
    today. In this chapter, we''ll use WordPress as our example to see how Less can
    first be incorporated directly in code or by using plugins. We''ll then move on
    to the conversion process, with a look at how to transition a WordPress site to
    use Less, and how we can remove the need to manually compile styles with the use
    of a Grunt plugin.'

    styles. We''ll take a look at its file structure and some of the mixins it uses
    before configuring it for use on a demo web page as a part of developing a workflow
    for using Bootstrap with Less.'

    of using frameworks, where the supplied code can be nonsemantic and inefficient.
    In this chapter, we''ll learn why frameworks aren''t always the answer to everything
    and that they can make it hard to transition to a different solution if we want
    to change. We''ll take a look at how we can use Less to help simplify complex
    styles, keep our HTML clean, and ultimately make frameworks work for us, and not
    the other way around.'

    chapter, we''ll take a look at how we can bring the power of image processing
