- en: It's possible to write a simple app with a handful of pages. Ionic provides
    a lot of out-of-the-box components that allow simple plug and play operations.
    When an app grows, managing different views and their custom data at a specific
    time or triggered event can be very complex. Ionic comes with some changes to
    the handling of state and navigation. In Ionic 1, you could use UI-Router for
    advanced routing management mechanisms. In Ionic, `NavController` enables the
    push/pop implementation of the navigation.

    components impact on your app's state hierarchy and when each state is triggered.

    it to other use cases. The example used is very basic, with three tabs and some
    sample Ionic components in each tab. This is a very common structure that you
    will find in many apps. You will learn how Ionic structures the tab interface
    and how it translates to individual folders and files.

- en: One important thing in `app.component.ts` is that you must declare a `root`
    page. You can see that from the template via `[root]="rootPage"`, and then again
    in the constructor via `this.rootPage = TabsPage`. The square brackets, `[]`,
    around `root` mean that it's a property of that DOM node. This is a new concept
    from Angular as it's trying to get rid of using a DOM property, such as `ngmodel`
    (which tends to result in lower performance). The assignment here is to tell Ionic
    2 that you will use `TabsPage`, which was imported earlier, and assign that as
    a `root` page. Then, the `ion-nav` directive will look at its own `root` property
    to start rendering the page. There seem to be a lot of abstractions and boilerplate
    compared to Ionic 1\. However, this practice is recommended to ensure better separation
    and scaling.

    the second is `ion-row`, and the third is `ion-col`. `ion-grid` acts as a container
    for `ion-row` and `ion-col`. It takes the full width of the parent. `ion-row`
    is for creating rows in the grid. It takes the full width of `ion-grid`. `ion-col`
    is used to create a column inside `ion-row`. As I said in the chapter earlier,
    it is a 12-column grid. So, you can have a maximum of twelve columns in a row,
    without having a line break.

    a flex parent and `ion-col` are flex children.
