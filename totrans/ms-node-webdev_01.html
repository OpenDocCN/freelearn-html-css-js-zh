<h1 class="chaptertitle" id="_idParaDest-5">Getting Ready</h1>
<p class="normal1">Node.js is a <a id="_idIndexMarker000" class="calibre3"/>server-side JavaScript runtime that has become one of the most popular platforms for creating web applications. Node.js benefits from a vast library of packages and frameworks, providing every kind of feature and function imaginable, built on a rich API that Node.js provides for handling low-level tasks.</p>
<p class="normal">This book is different from most other Node.js books because it explains the relationship between the Node.js API and popular web application packages. Each chapter explains how a core feature required for web development can be implemented using the Node.js API, before replacing the custom implementation with a popular and well-tested open-source package.</p>
<p class="normal">Understanding the Node.js API gives you a solid understanding of how web application features really work, and using popular packages lets you build those features without having to write custom code. When problems arise, as they will in any project, your knowledge of the Node.js API will give you a solid foundation to demystify the way that specific packages work and to figure out what’s going wrong.</p>
<p class="normal">The first part of this book provides an overview of the tools used in Node.js development and provides a primer for the most important language and platform features, including how concurrency is implemented by JavaScript, and how this relates to handling HTTP requests using Node.js. </p>
<p class="normal">The second part of this book focuses on the key building blocks for web applications: generating HTML content, processing forms, using databases, and authenticating users.</p>
<p class="normal">The third and final part of this book demonstrates how the features described in earlier chapters can be combined to create a simple but realistic web store application. </p>
<p class="normal">This is the SportsStore example that I have used in many of my books, and which includes common features such as a product catalog, a shopping cart, a checkout process, and administration features.</p>
<h1 class="heading" id="_idParaDest-6">What do you need to know?</h1>
<p class="normal1">To follow the examples in this book, you should be familiar with HTML and CSS and understand the basics of JavaScript development. I provide a primer for the JavaScript features that are useful for this book, but this isn’t a complete language tutorial.</p>
<h1 class="heading" id="_idParaDest-7">How do you set up your development environment?</h1>
<p class="normal1">The tools <a id="_idIndexMarker001" class="calibre3"/>needed for Node.js development are set up in <em class="italic">Chapter 2</em>. Later chapters require additional tools and packages, with full instructions provided for each.</p>
<h1 class="heading" id="_idParaDest-8">Are there lots of examples?</h1>
<p class="normal1">There are <em class="italic">loads</em> of examples. The best way to learn is by example, and I have packed as many of them into this book as I can. To maximize the number of examples in this book, I have adopted a simple convention to avoid listing the same code or content repeatedly. When I create a file, I will show its full contents, just as I have in <em class="italic">Listing 1.1</em>. I include the name of the file and its folder in the listing’s header, and I show the changes that I have made in bold.</p>
<p class="packt_figref">Listing 1.1: Asserting an unknown value in the index.ts file in the primer folder</p>
<pre class="programlisting"><code class="hljs-code">function getUKCapital() : string {
    return "London";
}
function writeCity(f: () =&gt; string)  {
    console.log(`City: ${f()}`)
}
writeCity(getUKCapital);
writeCity(() =&gt; "Paris");
<strong class="screentext">let myCity = "Rome";</strong>
<strong class="screentext">writeCity(() =&gt; myCity);</strong>
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">This is a listing from <em class="italic">Chapter 3</em>, which shows the contents of a file called <code class="inlinecode">index.ts</code> that can be found in the <code class="inlinecode">primer</code> folder. Don’t worry about the content of the listing or the purpose of the file; just be aware that this type of listing contains the complete contents of a file and that the changes you need to make to follow the example are shown in bold.</p>
<p class="normal">Some code files become long, and the feature I will describe will require only a small change. Rather than list the complete file, I use an ellipsis (three periods in succession) to indicate a partial listing, which shows just a portion of the file, as shown in <em class="italic">Listing 1.2</em>.</p>
<p class="packt_figref">Listing 1.2. Including user input in the sql_repository.Ts file in the src/server/data folder</p>
<pre class="programlisting"><code class="hljs-code">...
getResultsByName($name: string, $limit: number): Promise&lt;Result[]&gt; {
    <strong class="screentext">return this.executeQuery</strong><strong class="screentext">(`</strong>
<strong class="screentext">SELECT Results.*, name, age, years, nextage FROM Results</strong>
<strong class="screentext">        INNER JOIN People ON personId = People.id</strong>
<strong class="screentext">INNER JOIN Calculations ON calculationId = Calculations.id</strong>
<strong class="screentext">WHERE name = "${$name}"`, {});</strong>
}
...
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">This is a listing from <em class="italic">Chapter 12</em>, and it shows a set of changes applied to one part of a larger file. When you see a partial listing, you will know that the rest of the file does not have to change and that only the sections marked in bold are different.</p>
<p class="normal">In some cases, changes are required in different parts of a file, which makes it difficult to show as a partial listing. In this situation, I omit part of the file’s contents, as shown in <em class="italic">Listing 1.3</em>.</p>
<p class="packt_figref">Listing 1.3. Defining model relationships in the orm_helpers.ts file in the src/server/data folder</p>
<pre class="programlisting"><code class="hljs-code">import { DataTypes, Sequelize } from "sequelize";
import { Calculation, Person, ResultModel } from "./orm_models";
const primaryKey = {
    id: {
        type: DataTypes.INTEGER,
        autoIncrement: true,
        primaryKey: true
    }       
};
export const initializeModels = (sequelize: Sequelize) =&gt; {
    // ...statements omitted for brevity...
}
<strong class="screentext">export const defineRelationships = () =&gt; {</strong>
<strong class="screentext">ResultModel.belongsTo(Person, { foreignKey: "personId" });</strong>
<strong class="screentext"> </strong><strong class="screentext">ResultModel.belongsTo(Calculation, { foreignKey: "calculationId"});</strong>
<strong class="screentext">}</strong>
</code></pre>
<p class="normal">In this listing, the changes are still marked in bold, and the parts of the file that are omitted from the listing are not affected by this example.</p>
<h1 class="heading" id="_idParaDest-9">Where can you get the example code?</h1>
<p class="normal1">You can <a id="_idIndexMarker002" class="calibre3"/>download the example projects for all the chapters in this book from <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Node.js-Web-Development" class="calibre3">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Node.js-Web-Development</a>. We also have other code bundles from our rich catalog of books and videos available at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/" class="calibre3">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/</a>. Check them out!</p>
<h1 class="heading" id="_idParaDest-10">What if you have problems following the examples?</h1>
<p class="normal1">The first thing to do is to go back to the start of the chapter and start over. Most problems are caused by skipping a step or not fully applying the changes shown in a listing. Pay close attention to the bold emphasis in code listings, which highlights the changes that are required.</p>
<p class="normal">Then, check the errata/corrections list, which is included in the book’s GitHub repository. Technical books are complex, and mistakes are inevitable, despite my best efforts and those of my editors. Check the errata list for the list of known errors and instructions to resolve them.</p>
<p class="normal">If you still have problems, then download the project for the chapter you are reading from the book’s GitHub repository (<a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Node.js-Web-Development" class="calibre3">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Node.js-Web-Development</a>) and compare it to your project. I created the code for the GitHub repository by working through each chapter, so you should have the same files with the same contents in your project.</p>
<p class="normal">If you still can’t get the examples working, then you can contact me at <a href="mailto:adam@adam-freeman.com" class="calibre3">adam@adam-freeman.com</a> for help. Please make it clear in your email which book you are reading, and which chapter/example is causing the problem. A page number or code listing is always helpful. Please remember that I get a lot of emails and that I may not respond immediately.</p>
<h1 class="heading" id="_idParaDest-11">What if you find an error in the book?</h1>
<p class="normal1">You can report errors to me by email at <a href="mailto:adam@adam-freeman.com" class="calibre3">adam@adam-freeman.com</a> or visit <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/submit-errata" class="calibre3">http://www.packtpub.com/submit-errata</a>, click <strong class="screentext">Submit Errata</strong>, and fill in the form, although I ask that you first check the errata/corrections list for this book, which you can find in the book’s GitHub repository at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Node.js-Web-Development" class="calibre3">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Mastering-Node.js-Web-Development</a>, just in case it has already been reported.</p>
<p class="normal">I add errors that are likely to confuse readers, especially problems with example code, to the errata/corrections file on the GitHub repository, with a grateful acknowledgment to the first reader who reported it. I also publish a list of less serious issues, which usually means errors in the text surrounding the code that are less likely to confuse.</p>
<h1 class="heading" id="_idParaDest-12">How do you contact the author?</h1>
<p class="normal1">You can email me at <a href="mailto:adam@adam-freeman.com" class="calibre3">adam@adam-freeman.com</a>. It has been a few years since I started publishing an email address in my books. I wasn’t entirely sure that it was a good idea, but I am glad that I did it. I have received emails from around the world, from readers working or studying in every industry, and – for the most part, anyway – the emails are positive, polite, and a pleasure to receive.</p>
<p class="normal">I try to reply promptly, but I get many emails, and sometimes I get a backlog, especially when I have my head down trying to finish writing a book. I always try to help readers who are stuck with an example in the book, although I ask that you follow the steps described earlier in this chapter before contacting me.</p>
<p class="normal">While I welcome reader emails, there are some common questions for which the answers will always be “no.” I am afraid that I won’t write the code for your new start-up, help you with your college assignment, get involved in your development team’s design dispute, or teach you how to program.</p>
<h1 class="heading" id="_idParaDest-13">What if you really enjoyed this book?</h1>
<p class="normal1">Please email at <a href="mailto:adam@adam-freeman.com" class="calibre3">adam@adam-freeman.com</a> and let me know. It is always a delight to hear from a happy reader, and I appreciate the time it takes to send those emails. Writing these books can be difficult, and those emails provide essential motivation to persist in an activity that can sometimes feel impossible. Alternatively, you can also send feedback to <a href="mailto:feedback@packtpub.com" class="calibre3">feedback@packtpub.com</a>.</p>
<div><h1 class="heading" id="_idParaDest-14">What if this book has made you angry?</h1>
<p class="normal1">You can still email at <a href="mailto:adam@adam-freeman.com" class="calibre3">adam@adam-freeman.com</a>, and I will still try to help you. Bear in mind that I can help only if you explain what the problem is and what you would like me to do about it. You should understand that, sometimes, the only outcome is to accept I am not the writer for you and that we will have closure only when you return this book and select another. I’ll give careful thought to whatever has upset you, but after 25 years of writing books, I have come to accept that not everyone enjoys reading the books I like to write. Alternatively, you can also send feedback to <a href="mailto:feedback@packtpub.com" class="calibre3">feedback@packtpub.com</a>.</p>
<p class="normal">Now that you understand the structure of the book, the next chapter explores the tools used for Node.js development.</p>
