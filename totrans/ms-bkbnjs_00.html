It provides a set of small and focused objects to be used as bricks when building frontend applications.</p><p>The beauty of Backbone is that it gives you the freedom to build your applications with your rules. However, with great power comes great responsibility; Backbone does not tell you anything about how to structure your applications. Keep in mind that Backbone is not a framework but a library.</p><p>After years of working with Backbone projects, making code experiments, and exploring code from other developers, I have identified patterns and best practices when building frontend web apps with Backbone.</p><p>This book explains how to give structure to your applications. It gives you the tools and strategies to create robust and maintainable web apps. It will help you define and assign the right responsibilities to the Backbone objects and define a new set of glue objects.</p><p>In the book, you will build a functional application applying the concepts that are exposed here. The application is simple enough to put in to practice the core concepts when building scalable frontend applications with Backbone. At any time, you can see the project code in the book repository at <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/abiee/mastering-backbone">https://github.com/abiee/mastering-backbone</a>.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Architecture of a Backbone application">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Architecture of a Backbone application</em>, deals with the project organization at two levels: logical and physical. On the logical side, you will learn how to connect the Backbone objects, while on the physical side, you will see where to put your scripts.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Managing Views">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Managing views</em>, helps you extract the common patterns of views and create a new set of general purpose views that can be used on any Backbone application. These views will remove a lot of boilerplate code when managing views.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Model Bindings">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Model bindings</em>, explains how to deal with complex REST resources and helps you handle embedded resources and keep it in sync with views.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Modular Code">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Modular code</em>, covers dependency management and script bundling with Browserify. Modern applications are becoming more JavaScript-intensive, so it's a good idea to handle dependencies in a smarter way.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Dealing with Files">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Dealing with files</em>, it covers the common requirement for web applications to upload files to a server, this chapter tells you how to do it in Backbone with a REST server.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Store data in the Browser">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Store data in the browser</em>, shows you how to store data in the browser and how to do it from a Backbone perspective. The chapter shows how to build two drivers to transparently store Backbone models in localStorage and indexedDB instead of a remote server. This can be useful if you want to create offline applications.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Build Like a Pro">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Build like a pro</em>, tells you how you can automatize common and repetitive tasks in a script. It will dramatically improve your productivity. It describes how you can build a development workflow that automatically refreshes your project every time you make a small change.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Testing Backbone Applications">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Testing Backbone applications</em>, shows you the strategies and best practices when testing frontend code.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Deploying to Production">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Deploy to production</em>, shows you how to deploy the project to a production server. While high-demand applications need a sophisticated platform, this chapter gives you the starting point for small apps.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Authentication">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Security</em>, teaches you how to authenticate against the REST servers and how to manage sessions from the Backbone side.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>Though this book is for frontend applications, you will need to install Node version 5 or superior. Node will run the example REST server, automatize common tasks, and manage project dependencies.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is made for developers who already know Backbone but want to create better projects; it does not explain Backbone from scratch. Instead, I will show you how to improve your skills to organize and structure your application in an effective way.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "We can include other contexts through the use of the <code class="literal">include</code> directive."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">[default]
exten =&gt; s,1,Dial(Zap/1|30)
exten =&gt; s,2,Voicemail(u100)
exten =&gt; s,102,Voicemail(b100)
exten =&gt; i,1,Voicemail(s0)</pre></div><p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">[default]
exten =&gt; s,1,Dial(Zap/1|30)
exten =&gt; s,2,Voicemail(u100)
<strong>exten =&gt; s,102,Voicemail(b100)</strong>
exten =&gt; i,1,Voicemail(s0)</pre></div><p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">

<strong>     /etc/asterisk/cdr_mysql.conf</strong>
</pre></div><p>
<strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "Clicking the <strong>Next</strong> button moves you to the next screen."</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip01"/>Tip</h3><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p></div></div></div>
