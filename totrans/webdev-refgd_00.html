<html><head></head><body><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pref05"/>Preface</h1></div></div></div><p>This book covers many concepts that any web developer may need to know. These concepts may be new or known, but forgotten. The first two chapters in this book will cover the basic elements and attributes of HTML. The next four chapters will cover the concepts and syntax of CSS. JavaScript will be the focus of the next five chapters. Finally, we will cover external libraries. These include Bootstrap, jQuery, and Angular. Because this is a reference guide, it is not set up as a read-through tutorial. Each section and concept is written to stand on its own so that you can find the piece of information that you need quickly.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. HTML Elements">Chapter 1</a>, <em>HTML Elements</em>, covers all the elements that you will need when building a web page. This is focused on HTML5.</p><p>

<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. CSS Functions">Chapter 7</a>, <em>CSS Functions</em>, covers functions for filters, transforms, colors, gradients, and values. It covers a few extra concepts like at-rules, global keyword values, and miscellaneous.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. JavaScript Implementations, Syntax Basics, and Variable Types">Chapter 8</a>, <em>JavaScript Implementations, Syntax Basics, and Variable Types</em>, talks about JavaScript implementations and language basics, including syntax and variables and their types. This chapter will enable us to understand and get started with basic scripting.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. JavaScript Expressions, Operators, Statements, and Arrays">Chapter 9</a>, <em>JavaScript Expressions, Operators, Statements, and Arrays</em>, enables us to advance with our basic JavaScript language understanding and introduces JavaScript expressions, basic operators, statements, loops, conditions, and arrays. This also covers examples for better understanding.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. JavaScript Object-Oriented Programming">Chapter 10</a>, <em>JavaScript Object-Orientated Programming</em>, explains the basic concepts of object-oriented programming, that is, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation. You will also learn the usage of objects, classes, and related methods. We will cover examples for better understanding.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Extending JavaScript and ECMAScript 6">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Extending JavaScript and ECMA Script 6</em>, covers all the newly introduced features of ECMAScript 6, which was released in 2015, such as new objects, patterns, syntax changes, and new methods on existing objects. This chapter covers all these features in detail.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. Server-side JavaScript – NodeJS">Chapter 12</a>, <em>Server-side JavaScript – NodeJS</em>, continues to focus on JavaScript. The difference is that we will now write JavaScript on the server side instead of the client side. We can use the concepts covered in the other JavaScript chapters in addition to learning specific NodeJS objects and paradigms.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. Bootstrap – The Stylish CSS Frontend Framework">Chapter 13</a>, <em>Bootstrap – The Stylish CSS Frontend Framework</em>, talks about Bootstrap, which is an intuitive framework for creating responsive websites.

We will look at all the main concepts that you will need to begin writing applications with Angular.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>Most likely, for this book, you will need nothing that you are not already using! You will need a computer, a browser, and a text editor. Each chapter will cover different concepts and languages, so there may be differences between each chapter.</p><p>Here is a summary of the various things you will need throughout the chapters:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">For Chapters 1-5, you will only need a text editor and a browser.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">For Chapters 6-11, you will need the same text editor and browser, but with JavaScript being a programming language, I would recommend an integrated development environment (IDE). JetBrains makes a great IDE called WebStorm for web development. However, this is not necessarily needed for these chapters.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">For Chapters 12-14, you will again need a text editor and browser. An IDE would also be very helpful for this section. Anytime you are dealing with complex frameworks, an IDE will make your life easier.</li></ul></div><p>Although you can just use a notepad and a browser to do any sort of development, an IDE is always preferred and suggested for development in any specific language. I would suggest using Adobe Dreamweaver for beginners. The intellisense of IDE makes it a lot easier to code as it auto-suggests various methods, names, and variables, so you don't have to remember everything. As we will be dealing with the elements and document nodes in the JQuery section, you should have extensions enabled in your browser. ECMA Script 6 is very recent and not fully supported by all browsers. In some examples, you might have to load ES6 compilers to enable that feature in your browser. However, I would highly recommend that you use the latest version of Google Chrome as a client, as it covers most of the sections in ES6.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is intended for beginners as well as advanced web developers. This book will be a valuable resource for anyone who is a web developer.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "HTML5 has a simple document type declaration, <code class="literal">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">&lt;div class="example"&gt;
  This is an example HTML element
&lt;/div&gt;</pre></div><p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">try{
  <strong>JSON.parse(jsonObject);</strong>
} catch (ex) {
  //do something with this error
}</pre></div><p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting"><strong># cp /usr/src/asterisk-addons/configs/cdr_mysql.conf.sample</strong>
<strong>     /etc/asterisk/cdr_mysql.conf</strong>
</pre></div><p>
<strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "Clicking the <strong>Next</strong> button moves you to the next screen."</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip01"/>Tip</h3><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p></div></div></div>
