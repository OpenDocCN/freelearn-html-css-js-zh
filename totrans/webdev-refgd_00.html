These concepts may be new or known, but forgotten. The first two chapters in this book will cover the basic elements and attributes of HTML. The next four chapters will cover the concepts and syntax of CSS. JavaScript will be the focus of the next five chapters. Finally, we will cover external libraries. These include Bootstrap, jQuery, and Angular. Because this is a reference guide, it is not set up as a read-through tutorial. Each section and concept is written to stand on its own so that you can find the piece of information that you need quickly.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>Most likely, for this book, you will need nothing that you are not already using! You will need a computer, a browser, and a text editor. Each chapter will cover different concepts and languages, so there may be differences between each chapter.</p><p>Here is a summary of the various things you will need throughout the chapters:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">For Chapters 1-5, you will only need a text editor and a browser.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">For Chapters 6-11, you will need the same text editor and browser, but with JavaScript being a programming language, I would recommend an integrated development environment (IDE). JetBrains makes a great IDE called WebStorm for web development. However, this is not necessarily needed for these chapters.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">For Chapters 12-14, you will again need a text editor and browser. An IDE would also be very helpful for this section. Anytime you are dealing with complex frameworks, an IDE will make your life easier.</li></ul></div><p>Although you can just use a notepad and a browser to do any sort of development, an IDE is always preferred and suggested for development in any specific language. I would suggest using Adobe Dreamweaver for beginners. The intellisense of IDE makes it a lot easier to code as it auto-suggests various methods, names, and variables, so you don't have to remember everything. As we will be dealing with the elements and document nodes in the JQuery section, you should have extensions enabled in your browser. ECMA Script 6 is very recent and not fully supported by all browsers. In some examples, you might have to load ES6 compilers to enable that feature in your browser. However, I would highly recommend that you use the latest version of Google Chrome as a client, as it covers most of the sections in ES6.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is intended for beginners as well as advanced web developers. This book will be a valuable resource for anyone who is a web developer.

<div class="section" title="Conventions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "HTML5 has a simple document type declaration, <code class="literal">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;div class="example"&gt;
  This is an example HTML element
&lt;/div&gt;</pre></div><p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">try{
