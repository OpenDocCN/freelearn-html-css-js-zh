    we can start building a chatbot that takes the user through a more complex flow.

    doing, and we'll look at the best ways to approach the design and setup.

    with multiple sub-flows. We then built these flows into a set of intents, which
    allow a user to go through the full process, or to do part of the process and
    return later. This meant we need to trigger intents directly from other intents,
    pre-populating some of the slots and using *confirmation intents* to change from
    one intent to another. We've also learned how to use DynamoDB tables to store
    and retrieve data about the progress of the users.
