Just when you think you have it entirely figured out, performance or cross-browser issues reveal themselves in the worst possible way. Lo-Dash is just one of many libraries that aim to help JavaScript programmers write code that's elegant, efficient, and portable. Underscore.js introduced a better way to perform functional programming with JavaScript. Lo-Dash is a continuation of this effort, and throughout this book, we'll see what sets Lo-Dash apart from other libraries out there, including Underscore.</p><p>At its heart, JavaScript is a functional language, but not necessarily a pure functional language—you can modify variables and introduce side effects. However, functions are first-class citizens and you can do a lot with them. Lo-Dash embraces this idea and gives programmers all the tools they need to write functional code that's readable and maintainable. All the cool things you can do with higher-order functions in other languages are possible with Lo-Dash as well.</p><p>It's not just the low-level utilities and performance gains that Lo-Dash delivers, though these are always welcome; it's also the enhanced programming model and the ideas that Lo-Dash borrows from other languages such as functional and applicative programming. These are imparted to JavaScript applications as a coherent API. Underscore got the ball rolling, and Lo-Dash further enhances these ideas, albeit using different design and implementation strategies.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Working with Arrays and Collections">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Working with Arrays and Collections</em>, explains that collections are similar to arrays but are more general than arrays. This chapter looks at the differences between these two constructs and the available Lo-Dash functions that operate on them.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Working with Objects">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Working with Objects</em>, teaches you how Lo-Dash treats objects as collections. This chapter looks at the available functions that work with objects.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Working with Functions">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Working with Functions</em>, focuses on the functional tools provided by Lo-Dash.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Transformations Using Map/Reduce">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Transformations Using Map/Reduce</em>, explains that the map/reduce programming model is used often in the Lo-Dash code. This chapter offers many examples that utilize the Lo-Dash map/reduce tools in their various forms.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Assembling Chains">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Assembling Chains</em>, explains how Lo-Dash can chain together functions that operate on a value. This chapter explores what chains are and how they work.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Application Building Blocks">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Application Building Blocks</em>, looks at the high-level application components that help organize the Lo-Dash code.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Using Lo-Dash with Other Libraries">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Using Lo-Dash with Other Libraries</em>, explains that Lo-Dash doesn't do everything. This chapter uses examples to illustrate where other libraries can help Lo-Dash and vice versa.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Internal Design and Performance">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Internal Design and Performance</em>, looks at some of the internal design decisions of Lo-Dash and provides some advice on how to improve the performance of your Lo-Dash code.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>The only software required for running the examples in this book is a modern web browser. All JavaScript libraries are packaged with the code samples. The only exception is <a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Using Lo-Dash with Other Libraries">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Using Lo-Dash with Other Libraries</em>, which involves working with Node.js (<a class="ulink" href="http://nodejs.org/">http://nodejs.org/</a>) and some corresponding npm packages.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is for the intermediate JavaScript programmer who is either new to Lo-Dash or has been using it for a while. Whether you've never written a line of Lo-Dash or you've got Lo-Dash code running in production, this book has something for you. Ideally, you've written some intermediate/advanced JavaScript code and utilized libraries such as jQuery or Backbone.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and explanations of their meanings.</p><p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "The <code class="literal">union()</code> function concatenates collections, with duplicate values removed."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">var collection = [ 
    { name: 'Jonathan' },
    { first: 'Janet' },
    { name: 'Kevin' },
    { name: 'Ruby' }
];

if (!_.every(collection, 'name')) {
    return 'Missing name property';
}
// → "Missing name property"</pre></div><p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>npm install -g grunt-cli grunt-contrib-connect</strong>
</pre></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div></div></div>
