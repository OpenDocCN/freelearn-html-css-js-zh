    respective users. A developer gets a notification of a task being assigned. A
    tester gets a notification when the task is moved to testing. A notification is
    sent to all users watching a particular task whenever a new comment is added to
    it.

    are the most common. This chapter will continue our development path to add a
    notification module.

    informing the respective stakeholders about the ongoing changes and activities.
    When a new task is assigned to a developer, an email notification can alert with
    highlights of the task, ensuring that the developer is informed and updated timely.
    A QA team member can receive an email about a task being moved to the testing
    phase.

    inside the user interface notification (in case of websites). In this chapter,
    we will focus on Emails but the process will also lay down the foundation for
    implementation of other types of notifications.'

    `**notification_util.ts**`. This file would contain a class which will hold utility
    methods to send notifications.
