    tools. **Progressive Web Apps** (**PWAs**) require a new model but that can produce
    many opportunities for errors to creep into the code. The good news is that there
    are several tools that you can integrate into your workflow to improve your application
    code's integrity.

    me ensure that my applications meet a level of consistent quality before I ship
    them. These include **PWABuilder**, **Lighthouse**, **Sonar**, and **WorkBox**.

    to ensure that a minimum criteria is met, including PWA, performance, hosting,
    and SEO requirements. PWABuilder and Workbox are very helpful in scaffolding important
    aspects of progressive web apps including the manifest, icons, and service workers.

    as part of a script and from the command line. This means that you can include
    much of this functionality as part of your automated workflow and build processes.
