- en: Backbone.js has an excellent documentation that provides a detailed overview
    of all of its components. However, you may find it insufficient to learn everything
    about the technology when you start developing your own applications. Throughout
    this book, various resources have been mentioned for different topics. I am listing
    a few more resources here. I found them to be very helpful while working with
    Backbone.js and recommend you to follow them too.
