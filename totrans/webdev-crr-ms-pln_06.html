<h1 id="_idParaDest-160"><a id="_idTextAnchor160"/>Exploring Modern Frontend Development</h1>
<p>Okay, the last two chapters have in large part focused on the backend. Not exclusively, of course, since we touched on some things that aren’t backend, but largely. In this chapter, we’re going to jump with both feet back onto the frontend.</p>
<p>As far as the frontend goes, where are we so far? Well, you’ve gotten a pretty good look at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the basics of web development. Every web developer needs to know about these to be effective.</p>
<p>But what would you think if I told you that, in most modern web development, you might not be working with them in exactly the form you’ve seen so far? In fact, in some cases, you might barely work with them at all. That would seem weird and contradictory, right?</p>
<p>Alas, it is, to a large degree, the reality!</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’re going to look at some technologies that are built <em class="italic">on top</em> of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, in some cases extending them, and ultimately leading to a place where you aren’t working with plain old HTML, CSS, and JavaScript anymore. These include frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue, frontend toolkits such as Bootstrap and Tailwind, and <strong class="bold">TypeScript</strong> (<strong class="bold">TS</strong>). You’ll also see how they have many benefits in terms of what you can deliver to your clients.</p>
<p>By the end, you’ll have a good understanding of why this trend of moving away from plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is so popular and so beneficial.</p>
<p>So, we’ll cover the following main topics here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Abstracting away the basics</li>
<li>Meeting the modern frontend frameworks</li>
<li>Boosting CSS capabilities</li>
<li>Transpiling and data typing</li>
<li>Packing up and going – bundlers</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-161"><a id="_idTextAnchor161"/>Technical requirements</h1>
<p>For this chapter, you will need the download the source code bundle from GitHub. Since I expect that you’ve already installed Node (and thus npm), that’s it! Everything you’ll need will be in the <code>ch-06</code> directory, ready to go.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-162"><a id="_idTextAnchor162"/>Abstracting away the basics</h1>
<p>A long time ago, in an internet far, far away, developing websites was kind of a pain in the butt. You see, for a long time, browsers didn’t all work the same. You might write some HTML and have it look great in Netscape Navigator, but then find it didn’t look right in Internet Explorer. Or, you might write some JavaScript that worked perfectly in Internet Explorer but then caused an error in Opera. And CSS required all sorts of hacks to make it work even remotely the same across browsers.</p>
<p>Today, we tend to write to standards, which are well-defined guidelines that browsers follow for how HTML, JavaScript, and CSS work. So long as you write to standards, and the browsers implement the standards properly, what you write will nearly always work the same across the major browsers at least.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t always like that, not by a long shot.</p>
<p>Before standards were the order of the day, developers decided that building websites with plain HTML, JavaScript, and CSS wasn’t always the best experience. At that point, they started writing abstraction layers on top of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. These came in the form of various JavaScript libraries that would do the work of creating the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for you in effect. And they did so intelligently, meaning if they saw you were running in Internet Explorer, they knew how to output the right code for it, but could then output the right code for Netscape when running in that browser (don’t worry if you’ve never even heard of Netscape – it’s a long-defunct browser that was popular in the early days of the web – that is, the late 1990s and early 2000s).</p>
<p>The goal of these abstractions is <a id="_idIndexMarker615"/>primarily threefold:</p>
<ul>
<li>One is that they allow you to write less code! If there is a single function you can call that will produce a UI with a button and some text that the button can collapse and expand, then that’s a lot less code you have to write – a lot less custom HTML, CSS, and <a id="_idIndexMarker616"/>JavaScript that you could get wrong.</li>
<li>Following on from the previous point, writing less code yourself means you can deliver results quicker. Not having to write all that expand/collapse code yourself saves time, which clients tend to like.</li>
<li>The third key benefit is that shared code tends to be more robust code. If you use code that someone else wrote, and there are a lot of other people out there using it too, then there is a good chance that code is very sound, error-free, performs well, and is just generally problem-free.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the biggest names ever in the area of abstractions was, and in some places still is, jQuery. It could be argued that the World Wide Web wouldn’t have become what it is today without jQuery, a JavaScript library that provides a long list of functions designed to work across all supported browsers.</p>
<p>For example, in plain JavaScript, you can get a reference to a DOM node with this code:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
const node = document.getElementById("mySpecialDiv");</pre> <p>If you have a <code>&lt;div id="mySpecialDiv"&gt;</code> element on the page, then the <code>node</code> variable will reference it and you can manipulate it in various ways. While that is a common, fully cross-browser function today, it wasn’t always. At one point, you might have to write different code for different browsers, and someone would have to determine which code to execute when needed.</p>
<p>But, enter jQuery, and you could write something like this:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
const node = $("#mySpecialDiv");</pre> <p>The <code>$()</code> function – yes, <code>$</code> is a valid function name in JavaScript, despite it not looking like any of the function names you’ve seen to this point and it just being a single non-alphanumeric character – is provided by jQuery (if you import jQuery into your page that is, and it’s just a JavaScript file, so that’s easy enough) and it took care of whatever differences the browsers may have. With jQuery, that line of code works in all supported browsers equally, and you don’t have to worry about how one browser does things versus another because jQuery handles all that for you.</p>
<p>jQuery is a library and a small one at that. But what does the word library mean in this context? And what does it mean compared to the terms framework and toolkit, which are commonly spoken <a id="_idIndexMarker617"/>about in software development in general, which of course includes web development? We can break it down like so:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em class="italic">library</em> is a collection of functions<a id="_idIndexMarker618"/> and callable routines that can be written in any language. With a library, you are in command of the flow and structure of your application, and you use the library only when you need it. Your code always calls the library.</li>
<li>A <em class="italic">framework</em>, on the other hand, provides the overall structure for your application. You have to fit your <a id="_idIndexMarker619"/>code into the structure the framework dictates (with varying degrees of rigidity, depending on the framework author’s basic thinking). The framework’s code controls the flow, at various points calling your code in response to various events.</li>
<li>A <em class="italic">toolkit</em> is a set of tools or <a id="_idIndexMarker620"/>components for a specific domain. Most commonly, a toolkit refers to user interface components – things such as buttons, grids, progress bars, and other elements you might see in a user interface. In fact, in my experience, you will rarely see the word toolkit used in any context other than building interfaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>The difference between the three ultimately comes down mostly to what’s most in control. If your code is calling on other code, then your code is in control, and that other code is, therefore, most likely a library or toolkit. If, on the other hand, the other code calls your code most of the time, then that other code is more in control, and there is then a good bet that it’s a framework.</p>
<p>To be sure, this is a borderline academic discussion: whether something is a library, framework, or toolkit isn’t usually something we need to worry about too much when developing a website. It’s worth understanding the difference, but at the end of the day, so long as a given thing helps us get our job done, then it can be whatever it wants to be!</p>
<p>But, with that said, it’s also worth noting that there is some overlap and even some degree of fungibility to these terms. You can easily find online debates about whether <em class="italic">X</em> or <em class="italic">Y</em> is a library or framework (toolkits tend to be a bit more obvious). It’s less important what they are and more important what they can do for you.</p>
<p>Now, let’s meet three of the most popular frontend frameworks out there today: React, Angular, and Vue.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-163"><a id="_idTextAnchor163"/>Meeting the modern frontend tools</h1>
<p>Today, there is a bit of a schism in web development. There is a group of web developers who like the “vanilla” approach, which <a id="_idIndexMarker621"/>means you use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, just as you’ve seen so far. On the other hand, there is another group that feels there are better answers at higher levels of abstraction. They feel that there is a lot of benefit to libraries, frameworks, and toolkits since they can do things such as smooth over browser differences (as the jQuery library does), or even save us from writing a lot of what would be complex HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as the MUI toolkit does by providing a wealth of premade widgets to build interfaces with. There are pluses and minuses to both approaches, and there is no canonically <em class="italic">correct</em> answer.</p>
<p>However, it’s not crazy to suggest that “team vanilla” is the smaller group these days, and the prevailing wisdom is that using modern libraries, frameworks, and toolkits is the better way to go in most ways. And, of course, even if you only ever use these things, you <em class="italic">still</em> need to know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. That is foundational knowledge. These modern tools build on them, and extend them, but rarely replace them outright (you can find a few that do, but they tend to be the minority).</p>
<p>So, what you’ve learned so far is in absolutely no way a wasted effort – it was <em class="italic">required</em> to be able to understand something such as React.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">React above them all</p>
<p class="callout">It may seem that I’m giving far more attention to React than any others, and that’s intentional: React is, by a fairly wide margin, the most popular frontend tool out there at the time of writing. It’s the one you’re most likely to use in most environments. It’s also arguably the simplest, and also in many regards looks similar to most others. While they’re all different, they have a common enough philosophy that I think if you understand React, then when and if you have to use something else, your React knowledge will provide a sufficient foundation to learn the other easily enough.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-164"><a id="_idTextAnchor164"/>Meeting React</h2>
<p><strong class="bold">React</strong> comes from our friends at Facebook (or our enemies – it seems everyone has an opinion about Facebook, and it tends to<a id="_idIndexMarker622"/> be pretty extreme one way or the other, rarely neutral). React is a library that focuses on building the user interface of websites, and little else. There is some degree of debate in development circles about whether React is a framework, but given that its creator calls it a library, I think we can reasonably go with that!</p>
<p>The underlying goal of React is to make it easy to reason about the state and structure of your interface at any given moment in time. What you see on the screen is a function of the underlying data – the state – that the UI is showing. It accomplishes this by way of components, which are essentially self-contained pieces of the interface. When you combine a whole bunch of components, you wind up with the overall interface, and a working website or web app ultimately, backed up by a set of data.</p>
<p>React uses a concept called the <strong class="bold">virtual DOM</strong>, or <strong class="bold">VDOM</strong>, to do all of this effectively. When you write code with React, you don’t work with the VDOM directly, but it’s always there. React uses it under the covers to make everything work, so what exactly is it?</p>
<p>You were introduced to the DOM earlier, that<a id="_idIndexMarker623"/> tree of elements that the browser creates from your markup, and which is manipulated by both code and events. When such changes occur, the browser must perform a lot of work, which can be intensive and expensive in terms of performance. Some changes don’t impact the flow, or structure, of the page, and are therefore less expensive. Something such as changing the color of existing text falls into this category. But something such as inserting a new <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element into the page changes the flow – the structure of the DOM essentially – and as a result, the browser has to recalculate a lot before it can then repaint the screen. The DOM handles all of this, and depending on the type and degree of change, it can result in a sluggish, slow interface that doesn’t react immediately to user interactions, which isn’t a good thing.</p>
<p>To deal with this problem, React introduces the concept of the VDOM. This is a secondary DOM that conceptually sits on top of the real DOM but is implemented in JavaScript. When something happens in React that requires the screen to be updated, rather than directly manipulating the real DOM immediately, the VDOM will be changed. This allows React to mediate and manage the changes to perform them more efficiently when they are ultimately done on the real DOM.</p>
<p>React uses what’s called a diffing algorithm, which is code that compares the VDOM to the real DOM and collects a list of the differences. React is then able to make intelligent decisions about the minimum set of changes that have to be made to the real DOM and can do things such as batch them all together (which tends to be more efficient than doing them one by one), or defer them until no other events occur, generally trying to minimize the amount of<a id="_idIndexMarker624"/> changes that have to occur to the real DOM. In general, assuming everything is done right, this <a id="_idIndexMarker625"/>approach can yield better performance than always manipulating the real DOM directly.</p>
<h3>A simple React example</h3>
<p>Let’s jump right into a React<a id="_idIndexMarker626"/> example:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 6.1: Be it ever so humble – a (very) simple React example" src="img/B18315_06_1.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.1: Be it ever so humble – a (very) simple React example</p>
<p>This example shows a friendly greeting and a<a id="_idIndexMarker627"/> button that increments a counter when clicked. It’s simple, but it’ll demonstrate the basics well enough. We’ll need to create three files – <code>react.html</code>, <code>react.js</code>,  and <code>react-greeting.js</code> – which you can find in the <code>ch-06</code> directory of the download bundle after that.</p>
<p>Let’s start with <code>react.html</code> (and work on the other two files shortly):</p>
<pre class="source-code">
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Simple React Example&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;script src="img/react.development.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="img/react-dom.development.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="img/babel.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div id="root"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;script type="text/babel" src="img/react-greeting.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script type="text/babel" src="img/react.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre> <p>To run this, you’ll need to put it on a web server; otherwise, you’ll run into problems with something called <code>react.development.js</code> script here can be a problem if the <code>unpkg.com</code> domain doesn’t allow requests from domains other than <code>unpkg.com</code>.</p>
<p>Now, as it turns out in this case, that’s not a problem because <code>unpkg.com</code> is what’s known as a <code>react.html</code> in your browser, namely that it won’t allow the JavaScript imports from a <code>file://</code> scheme. When a site is hosted on a web server, the scheme that’s used is <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code>, as we previously talked about. But when you just load a file from your local filesystem, the browser uses the <code>file://</code> scheme, and most browsers today will have CORS rules that won’t let the content be imported into the page if it doesn’t come from the local filesystem.</p>
<p>To get around that, we need to put the files on a web server so that the <code>http://</code> scheme will be used instead, and the requests will then work. There are many ways you could do that, but one of the simplest is to use the <code>http-server</code> package, which is a Node package that implements a simple web server as an executable program without you having to write any code. You just run it, and it starts a web server that makes the files in the directory you run it from accessible via browser by default.</p>
<p>So, to get set up, you need to create an npm/Node project, which you already know how to do:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
npm init</pre> <p>You would do this in the <code>ch-06</code> directory (you’ll find it’s already been done; I’m just walking you through the steps I did <a id="_idIndexMarker630"/>already) and select all defaults as usual. Then, add the <code>http-server</code> package as a dev dependency:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
npm install --save-dev http-server</pre> <p>Now, go into the <code>ch-06</code> directory <a id="_idIndexMarker631"/>and start the server, like so:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
npx http-server</pre> <p>At this point, you will be able to access the <code>react.html</code> file, like so:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
http://localhost:8081/react.html</pre> <p>You should see something like what’s shown in <em class="italic">Figure 6</em><em class="italic">.2</em> in your console:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 6.2: http-server, up and running, serving files" src="img/B18315_06_2.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.2: http-server, up and running, serving files</p>
<p>Now that you have it running, let’s take a look at the HTML file and see what’s going on.</p>
<p>First, we have three JavaScript files that have been imported:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>react.development.js</code> is React itself, and the development part indicates that this is a version suitable for development. There is also a non-development version, which is meant for when you deploy your site for real, and the difference is that the version will be<a id="_idIndexMarker632"/> reduced in size and obfuscated in a process called <strong class="bold">minification</strong>. Not only does this process reduce the size, but it also alters the code into a form that is more efficient, but also harder to debug. Once your site is fully working with the <a id="_idIndexMarker633"/>development version, that’s not a problem and it’ll be more important to have the more efficient version running.</li>
<li><code>react-dom.development.js</code> is a helper library that React uses to interface with the browser itself. Both are needed to use React in any meaningful way.</li>
<li><code>babel.min.js</code> is the in-browser version of something called Babel. That’s a topic I’ll be covering in the <em class="italic">Transpiling and data typing</em> section later, but in short, it’s a library that can take code in one form and convert it into another. In this case, it will be converting something called JSX into plain old JavaScript.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although it’s not what we’re primarily concerned with here, I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention the URLs that you see for these. As I mentioned earlier, these three files come from the <a href="http://unpkg.com">unpkg.com</a> CDN. This is a popular site that hosts all sorts of libraries, frameworks, and toolkits. It hosts everything that can be found on npmjs.org, which is where npm gets everything you install from. The way you use it is to specify a URL in the general form:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
unpkg.com/&lt;package&gt;@&lt;version&gt;/&lt;file&gt;</pre> <p>This way, you can get a copy of anything you want, and any version of it you want, without having to install it locally. This can not only be faster because CDNs like this will have multiple servers all around the world and will route requests to the nearest one for speed, but it also makes getting examples like this, or indeed real projects, up and running quickly and easily since you don’t have to worry about getting the dependencies yourself. It’s just another tool in the toolbox to be aware of.</p>
<h4>Our first component – RootComponent</h4>
<p>After the three imports are done, it’s just a<a id="_idIndexMarker634"/> simple HTML <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> with a single <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. This is where React will create our app, where it will generate HTML and insert it (as well as CSS and JavaScript). But the app is defined in a second file, the <code>react.js</code> file, which is imported right after that <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. Without it, we’d just have a blank page! So, let’s look at it now:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
const RootComponent = () =&gt; {
  const [ count, setCount ] = React.useState(0);
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;GreetingComponent textColor="red" /&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setCount(count + 1)}&gt;
        Increment
      &lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Count: {count}&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
ReactDOM.render(&lt;RootComponent /&gt;, document.getElementById("root"));</pre> <p>Every React app begins with a single root component. It can be the only component sometimes, though that doesn’t use the full power of React, which is building up an interface from several components.</p>
<p>A component can take a couple of different forms, but here, I’m focusing on the new form, which is generally considered better these days: functional components. In short, you have a JavaScript function that’s defined using arrow notation where a variable references <code>RootComponent</code>. That variable becomes a tag you can use later, as you’ll see shortly.</p>
<p>The job of any React component is to return HTML that is shown on the page. With a functional component, you simply return that markup from the function itself. How you return the markup is entirely<a id="_idIndexMarker635"/> up to you, but perhaps the most common form is shown here: JSX.</p>
<h4>JSX</h4>
<p>Inside the function that is our<a id="_idIndexMarker636"/> root component, you return the markup for the component, which can be any HTML you wish. But you may be looking at that code thinking something doesn’t look quite right, and you’re right: it’s not valid JavaScript!</p>
<p>Instead, this is another language called JSX, which is an extended version of JavaScript where you can embed HTML in it. That may sound weird, but it makes for much simpler code. Without JSX, what you see here would require several dozen lines of somewhat complex JavaScript code to build up the HTML that is returned by the function. Instead, with JSX, we can just write (a form of) HTML and the Babel import from earlier will convert it into JavaScript that calls on React functions to produce the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this component.</p>
<p>The markup that’s returned is fairly simple. It’s just a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element with a <code>&lt;GreetingComponent&gt;</code> element (whatever that is – we’ll get to that soon), a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element, and a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element in it. The <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element has an <code>onClick</code> handler, but the syntax there is different than you’ve seen before. With JSX, the values of HTML tag properties must be enclosed in braces, not quotes like you’ve seen before. The value is a JavaScript function that, when called, calls the <code>setCount()</code> function, passing it the value of the <code>count</code> variable incremented by one. Inside the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element, there is some static text, and then a JSX expression. As with interpolated strings, which I’ve talked about before, JSX allows you to insert the value of JavaScript expressions into the markup to be returned. Here is the value of the <code>count</code> variable.</p>
<p>Now, I’ve skipped over a couple of things here, so let’s talk about them now, starting with that line of code before the <code>return</code> statement that implements something called state in our component.</p>
<h4>Component state</h4>
<p>React components can – but don’t <em class="italic">have</em> to – have state. That’s just a fancy way of saying it has data internal to it. Generally <a id="_idIndexMarker637"/>speaking, state can’t be touched from outside the component. There are many, many options for implementing state in a component, but the key thing that has to happen is inherent in the name React itself.</p>
<p>The name React comes from the fact that the UI you build with it is <em class="italic">reactive</em>, meaning it changes as data changes, whether triggered by user interaction or not. For example, since this app shows a counter and a button to increment it, we want the counter value to be updated on the screen when the user presses the button. In a web app using plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, you can imagine code that executes when the button is clicked which increments a JavaScript variable and then uses DOM methods to update the screen. But with React, much of that happens automatically, and it’s based on the notion of state.</p>
<p>When the state of a component – the data internal to it – changes, React will destroy the component and r-create it, which means the function you write is executed again to produce new markup which will use the new state data. The web app <em class="italic">reacts</em> to the change, in other words, without you directly updating the screen in code.</p>
<p>So, React has to be aware of the internal state data of a component because it has to monitor it for changes so that it knows when to destroy and re-create the component. Therefore, we can’t (usually) just have plain old JavaScript variables in there because React wouldn’t know about them. Instead, we have to create those variables in a way that makes React aware of them, and that’s what the call to <code>React.useState()</code> does.</p>
<p>We pass to it any JavaScript value we wish – in this case, just a number – and <code>React.useState()</code> returns a value that is two things: the current state of our new state variable, and a function to use to update it. It’s effectively that update function that makes React aware of changes: any time we call it, React knows the state of our component has changed, and it can decide whether the component needs to be destroyed and re-created or not.</p>
<p>Since we want to have a reference to both of the things returned by that call, we use a JavaScript capability called <code>const [ count, setCount ]</code> part of the line is for. When executed, it results in two variables being created, one named <code>count</code> and another named <code>setCount</code>. The <code>count</code> variable gets the current value we set in the state, which is 0, and the second gets a reference to the <code>update</code> function. Destructuring is a feature that allows you to copy the values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables. Without it, the code you would have to write to get the values from the array returned by <code>React.useState(0);</code> would be as follows:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
const state = React.useState(0);
const count = state[0];
const setCount = state[1];</pre> <p>Destructuring is just a shorter way of writing that code.</p>
<p>Having those variables available <a id="_idIndexMarker638"/>allows us to write the <code>onClick</code> handler on the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element now: the <code>setCount()</code> function is called, passing in the new value for the state variable, which is just <code>count+1</code>.</p>
<p>React will decide that the component should be destroyed and recreated, so our function will be called again, and new markup will be returned. This time, notice that inside <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is the <code>{count}</code> expression. This means that the current value of our state variable, <code>count</code>, will be inserted, so we’d see 1 on the screen after the first button click. It’s important to understand that state variables remain between component destruction and recreation. So, what’s returned by the call to <code>React.useState()</code> when the component is recreated won’t be 0, despite that being the value passed to it, because React will already be aware of this state variable and will have already created it with the default value when <code>React.useState()</code> was first called. So, it will return the current value, not the default value. It won’t recreate the component’s state – in other words, it’ll be kept no matter how many times the component is destroyed and recreated.</p>
<p>The final line of code here – the call to <code>ReactDOM.render()</code> – is what creates our interface. This kind of code is often termed <em class="italic">bootstrapping</em>, meaning it’s where the work begins, or where everything is kicked off from more colloquially. We pass to it the React component that is to be the root component of our app, and then a reference to the DOM node where it should be inserted. Look back on the HTML and you’ll recognize the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element with an ID of root. Whatever markup this root component returns will be inserted into that <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Now, what’s the deal with <code>&lt;GreetingComponent&gt;</code>? That’s not a real HTML tag! Well, it <em class="italic">could</em> be – you don’t know all HTML tags, after all – but it’s not, and the deal with it is that it’s another React<a id="_idIndexMarker639"/> component that I’ve created and it’s the one responsible for showing the greeting.</p>
<h4>Adding another component – GreetingComponent</h4>
<p>You’ll notice that <code>GreetingComponent</code> was imported into <code>react.html</code> before <code>react.js</code> was. This is important in that it has to<a id="_idIndexMarker640"/> be imported before it’s referenced in <code>react.js</code>; otherwise, when it’s referenced in <code>react.js</code>, we’d get a JavaScript error about it being undefined.</p>
<p>So, what does the code for that component look like? It’s quite simple, and it’s in the <code>react-greeting.js</code> file, which is the third of the three imported into the <code>index.html</code> file:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
const GreetingComponent = ({textColor}) =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p style={{ color: textColor }}&gt;I am a React app! There are many like it, but this one is mine!!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}</pre> <p>This time, no state is needed, so it’s nothing but a return statement returning some plain old HTML. The only thing of real note is the value of the style attribute. Normally, this would be something like <code>"color:red;"</code>, but since our components are written using JSX, that won’t work. Instead, we need to use the brace syntax, and then we list out the style attributes to set, which is just the color of the text set to red.</p>
<p>But I seem to have glossed over something, haven’t I? What’s that <code>textColor</code> stuff all about? That gets into another core concept of React named props.</p>
<h4>Props</h4>
<p>Props are the basic mechanism by which components can pass information to one another. Props always work from parent to child, meaning in our case that the root component can pass information<a id="_idIndexMarker641"/> to <code>GreetingComponent</code> since it’s the child of the root component, but not vice versa.</p>
<p>Props are simply attributes on the tags for the custom components you create, which is why you can write <code>&lt;GreetingComponent textColor="red" /&gt;</code>. Since the <code>GreetingComponent</code> function has an object with a <code>textColor</code> attribute in its signature, that’s enough for React to know that’s a valid prop that can be passed into <code>GreetingComponent</code>. Inside the function, you can access the <code>textColor</code> variable as you can any JavaScript variable, so we can insert it into the style attribute, as shown in this code. This way, our parent component (<code>RootComponent</code>) can tell <code>GreetingComponent</code> what color to make the text.</p>
<p>Components can be as simple or as complex as you need them to be, can have as many props as you need (or none at all), and can have state (or not). But the whole point of React, and almost any modern frontend framework, is to compose your UI from many small components. This makes testing them easier and allows you to build complex interfaces with components that you can reuse many times, saving time as you progress.</p>
<p>As neat as React is, sometimes, it’s not quite enough, and that’s where something called a meta framework comes in.</p>
<h3>Meta frameworks</h3>
<p>A <strong class="bold">meta framework</strong> is a framework that enhances other frameworks, sometimes combining multiple frameworks (or libraries or toolkits). It builds on top of another framework or platform, providing more <a id="_idIndexMarker642"/>capabilities, often in the form of automatic code generation.</p>
<p>In short, meta frameworks try to save you time by doing things such as supplying intelligent defaults for configuration and capabilities such as the ability to read in plain text files and generate a complete website from them. They can save a great deal of time and effort, with the main trade-off being a bit less developer control.</p>
<p>There are many meta frameworks, but one of the most popular is Next, built on top of React.</p>
<p>You have to remember that React is a pretty simple library. It provides the basic structure that components must follow, state and props, and a well-defined life cycle that all React apps and components go through. However, building a more complex web app will often require a lot more capabilities, all of which can be added to React piecemeal.</p>
<p>So, instead, you can use something <a id="_idIndexMarker643"/>such as Next, which adds a great many of them in for you at once, including the initial project setup. Some of the key things that Next adds on top of React are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic">Server-side rendering (SSR)</em>: Next allows React components to be rendered on the server, improving initial load times and <strong class="bold">search engine optimization</strong> (<strong class="bold">SEO</strong>, the art of getting as high as possible in search engine results).</li>
<li><em class="italic">Static site generation (SSG)</em>: You can pre-render pages at build time rather than at runtime, which is great for performance and SEO.</li>
<li><em class="italic">File-based routing</em>: Next uses a filesystem-based routing mechanism. Pages are automatically routed based on their filenames in a specified directory. This provides a common structure and navigational model to your website automatically.</li>
<li><em class="italic">API routes</em>: This allows you to create API endpoints as part of your Next application. This is useful for building full-stack applications with a unified codebase.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Zero configuration</em>: Next works out-of-the-box with minimal setup, yet it’s highly configurable for more complex needs.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Automatic code splitting</em>: Next automatically splits code into manageable chunks, loading only what’s necessary for the current page, which enhances performance.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Built-in CSS and Sass support</em>: Next has built-in support for CSS and Sass (an extended form of CSS), allowing you to import styles directly into your components.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Image optimization</em>: Next includes automatic image optimization for better performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next adds all of this, and more, to React, saving you the hassle of adding it all yourself. Therefore, it is the quintessential <a id="_idIndexMarker644"/>meta framework, making use of many other libraries and frameworks to deliver these abilities.</p>
<p>Now, let’s look at a competitor to React, another relatively small library that has gained a lot of traction quickly: Vue.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-165"><a id="_idTextAnchor165"/>Meeting Vue</h2>
<p><strong class="bold">Vue</strong>, created by Evan You and first released in 2014, is a JavaScript library that’s used for building user interfaces and SPAs. It is <a id="_idIndexMarker645"/>designed to be incrementally adoptable, meaning it can <a id="_idIndexMarker646"/>be easily integrated into projects where jQuery or another library is already in use, or it can be used to build more sophisticated applications when combined with modern tooling and supporting libraries.</p>
<p>Some of Vue’s core features are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic">Reactive and composable view layer</em>: At its core, Vue focuses on the view layer – that is, the user interface. It supplies a reactive way to render data to the DOM using straightforward template <a id="_idIndexMarker647"/>syntax, meaning that like React, it knows when to re-draw parts of the page when state changes, and the components you build use a simple string-based markup generation approach.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Component-based architecture</em>: Vue encourages the use of components to build UIs. Each component in Vue is essentially a reusable instance with data, methods, and life cycle events.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Directives</em>: Vue uses special attributes, known as directives, to provide added functionality to existing HTML elements – for example, <code>v-if</code> for conditional rendering and <code>v-on</code> for handling events.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Transition effects</em>: Vue provides ways to apply transition animation effects when items are inserted, updated, or removed from the DOM.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Vue CLI</em>: This is a command-line tool for scaffolding (generating the basic skeleton of) Vue applications. It offers a range of build setups to start with and is highly configurable.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Vue router</em>: The official<a id="_idIndexMarker648"/> router for Vue. It integrates deeply with Vue Core to make building SPAs and managing the navigation between its screens with Vue a breeze.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Ease of learning</em>: Vue’s learning curve is generally considered to be less steep than other libraries. Its straightforward syntax and excellent documentation make it accessible to beginners.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Flexibility</em>: Vue’s design allows it to be as simple or complex as your project requires. It can be dropped into an existing project or used to build an entire project from scratch.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Performance</em>: Vue is lightweight and offers good performance. Its small size and efficient change detection mechanism make it fast.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Community support</em>: Although younger than some of its counterparts, Vue has a vibrant and growing community, with many resources for learning and a wide array of third-party plugins and components.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vue is well-suited for those starting in the <a id="_idIndexMarker649"/>world of modern JavaScript frameworks, as well as for developers building complex, large-scale applications. Its simplicity, combined with its power, makes it a popular choice among both beginners and seasoned developers.</p>
<p>Let’s take a brief look at a Vue app in action, starting with <code>vue.html</code>:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Simple Vue Example&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;script src="img/vue.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div id="app"&gt;
      &lt;example-component&gt;&lt;/example-component&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;script src="img/vue.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre> <p>This shouldn’t look too different from the React example from earlier. Similar to that example, we have a single <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element; this is where<a id="_idIndexMarker650"/> the interface built by Vue will live. However, as opposed to React, just a single import is required: Vue itself in <code>vue.js</code>.</p>
<p>But, unlike React, we have to put something there, namely our root component. I’ve created a custom component named <code>example-component</code>, so I can put the <code>&lt;example-component&gt;</code> custom tag there.</p>
<p>The <code>vueApp.js</code> file is then<a id="_idIndexMarker651"/> imported, which houses that custom component:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
Vue.component("example-component", {
  data: function () {
    return {
      message: "I am a Vue app! There are many like it, but this one is mine!!",
      count: 0,
      color: "red"
    }
  },
  template: `
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p :style="{color}"&gt;{{message}}&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;button v-on:click="count++"&gt;Increment&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Count: {{count}}&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;`
});
new Vue({ el: "#app" });</pre> <p>With Vue, there’s no JSX (there doesn’t <em class="italic">have</em> to be with React either – it’s just easier this way), and instead we call the <code>Vue.component()</code> function to define a custom component. We give it a name as the first argument, and then pass in a JavaScript object that defines the component.</p>
<p>We can have internal state data as in React by defining a <code>data</code> attribute that is a function that returns an object<a id="_idIndexMarker652"/> having whatever state data we want as fields in it. Vue knows how to take this and monitor it like React so that it can update the interface as necessary when state changes, making everything reactive.</p>
<p>But rather than a React function returning markup, a Vue component must provide a <code>template</code> string that defines <a id="_idIndexMarker653"/>the markup this component produces. Here, I’ve used JavaScript string interpolation to allow the <code>template</code> string to flow across multiple lines so that I can insert elements from the state data object.</p>
<p>The output is very similar to the React example, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 6</em><em class="italic">.3</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 6.3: The Vue example, after a couple of button clicks" src="img/B18315_06_3.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.3: The Vue example, after a couple of button clicks</p>
<p>This time, though, the color of the message is defined in state directly rather than passed into the child component. The <code>:style</code> attribute syntax, that leading semicolon specifically, is necessary for Vue to be able to recognize that we want to output the <code>color</code> value in the generated HTML. Without it, you’d find that the style property isn’t present in the generated HTML and the text wouldn’t be red. Then, the <code>{{message}}</code> token has the effect of inserting<a id="_idIndexMarker654"/> the message text into the returned string.</p>
<p>The <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element uses a Vue directive, <code>v-on</code>, to define a click handler. Unlike with React, we can change – or <em class="italic">mutate</em>, as we like to say in computer science circles – the <code>count</code> value directly because Vue has intelligently hooked into it and so knows what to do when it sees this code. Note that this is shorter than the React equivalent. The current value of <code>count</code> is inserted with <code>{{count}}</code>, giving us, more or less, the same result as the React version.</p>
<p>Also, as with React, we have to bootstrap our app, but it’s a bit simpler here too. We create a new <code>Vue</code> object, passing it the ID of the existing HTML element to insert our root component into (<code>el</code> standing for element, and <code>#app</code> being like a CSS selector to find the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element with an ID of <code>app</code>), and that’s it! Vue takes care of the rest for us.</p>
<p>So, you’ve seen plain HTML/CSS/JSS, you’ve seen React, and now you’ve seen Vue. Those aren’t your only<a id="_idIndexMarker655"/> choices, of course. There are meta frameworks too, but there are also other frameworks out there that can be your one-stop shop for frontend development, and probably the biggest one is Angular.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-166"><a id="_idTextAnchor166"/>Meeting Angular</h2>
<p><strong class="bold">Angular</strong> is a free, open source web framework for building single-page web applications. It’s developed and maintained<a id="_idIndexMarker656"/> by Google, in addition to a larger community of individuals and corporations. Angular’s first release, known as Angular 2.0, was released on <a id="_idIndexMarker657"/>September 14, 2016. It was a complete rewrite of an earlier framework named AngularJS. While they share a similar name, they are rather different and are considered two different things entirely (if for no other reason than apps written using AngularJS will rarely work with Angular).</p>
<p>Angular has had many rapid-fire updates since its creation, some more notable than others. For example, Angular 4 was released on March 23, 2017, with Angular 5 following on November 1, 2017, the latter of which brought improvements such as support for progressive web apps. Angular 6, released on May 4, 2018, focused on the toolchain (the command-line tools you use to build Angular apps, which is a big part of what it does, and some would say its appeal), and ease of future development. Subsequent versions continued to add features and improvements regularly.</p>
<p>Angular is known for several key features. One is two-way data binding, which is a way to tie the UI components on the screen together with data. Essentially, a change in a UI component results in a change to the data, and vice versa, automatically, which leads to developers having to write less code in most cases while maintaining reactivity. Dependency injection is another <a id="_idIndexMarker658"/>key capability. This allows objects in code to be created by the framework and provided to application code, rather than the application code having to create them itself.</p>
<p>Like React and Vue, Angular follows a component-based architecture, allowing for reusable components and efficient development practices. However, Angular’s structure tends to be more complex. While React components are usually a combination of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, Angular apps will usually break those out into separate files, so a component will be made up of multiple source files rather than (usually) just one in React or Vue.</p>
<p>Angular tends to be used in large-scale “enterprise” web apps due to its robust feature set and scalability. Angular supplies virtually everything a developer may need to build such apps under one roof. This is in contrast to lighter libraries such as React or Vue, where you’ll typically need to add other libraries as you need them. For example, having your client-side code communicate with your server-side code will often mean adding a library such as Axios, an open-source communication library, to your React or Vue app. By contrast, Angular provides<a id="_idIndexMarker659"/> that function (you don’t <em class="italic">have</em> to use it, but one of the big draws of Angular is having just one dependency to deal with, so most Angular developers would tend to use it).</p>
<p>So, what separates Angular from React and Vue? Let’s look at some key highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic">Core philosophy</em>: Angular is a full-fledged framework offering a strong opinion on how your app should be structured<a id="_idIndexMarker660"/> and, as mentioned before, providing – theoretically – everything a developer needs in one place. React and Vue are libraries that focus just on UI components, giving you more freedom to use other libraries for different aspects of your app.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Language</em>: Angular uses TS, a language we’ll look at later, but in short, it’s an extended version of JavaScript that adds some key features, primarily strong typing. While you can develop React and Vue apps with TS as well, and many people do, Angular requires it (well, at least once you move beyond very basic example territory).</li>
<li><em class="italic">Data binding</em>: As mentioned previously, Angular has two-way data binding, meaning changes in the UI are automatically reflected in the app state and vice versa. React and Vue use a one-way data flow, where the UI is updated via state changes, making it more <a id="_idIndexMarker661"/>predictable but requiring more boilerplate to update the state.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Learning curve</em>: Angular’s comprehensive nature makes its learning curve steeper compared to React and Vue, which is more straightforward to start with due to its simplicity and focus on UI.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Performance</em>: While Angular has good performance overall, React and Vue tend to have better performance due to its virtual DOM system in the case of React and simplicity in the case of Vue.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you’re talking about Angular, React, or Vue, all three are powerful in their own right, and the choice often comes down to the specific needs and preferences of your project.</p>
<p>Let’s take a quick look at an <a id="_idIndexMarker662"/>Angular version of our counter example. As with React and Vue, we start with a plain HTML file:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Simple Angular Example&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;script src="img/angular.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="img/angular.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body ng-app="app"&gt;
    &lt;root-component&gt;&lt;/root-component&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre> <p>This basic form should start to look familiar at this point! Angular, at its most basic level, just requires a single <code>angular.min.js</code> file to be imported. With Angular, the element that the app will be rendered into (that the root component will be rendered into, in other words) is usually the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element itself.</p>
<p>And on the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag, you can see one thing that Angular does differently than React and Vue, and does so a lot, and that’s the use of <code>ng-app</code> is an example of.</p>
<p>You see, when a page that uses Angular<a id="_idIndexMarker663"/> loads, the Angular code goes through the HTML and looks for these directives, converting them (and often the entire tag it’s on) into other HTML markup that Angular needs. Here, <code>ng-app="app"</code> identifies the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element as containing an Angular app. Angular contains many directives for doing many things, some of which include creating repeating sections of markup (<code>NGFor</code>), adding or removing elements based on some logic condition (<code>NGIf</code>), and binding things together using two-way data binding (<code>NGModel</code>).</p>
<p>Once we have a container element for the app marked with the <code>ng-app</code> directive, we can begin to use custom components inside of it, and the <code>&lt;root-component&gt;</code> element is exactly that: a<a id="_idIndexMarker664"/> custom root component. As with React and Vue, all components will be children, direct or indirect, of a root component. Here’s the code for that component, contained in the imported <code>angular.js</code> file:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
var app = angular.module("app", []);
app.component("rootComponent", {
  template: '&lt;p style="color:{{textColor}}"&gt;{{message}}&lt;/p&gt;&lt;button ng-click="count=count+1"&gt;Increment&lt;/button&gt;&lt;p&gt;Count: {{count }}&lt;/p&gt;',
  controller: function($scope) {
    $scope.message = "I am an Angular app! There are many like it, but this one is mine!!";
    $scope.count = 0;
    $scope.textColor = "red";
  }
});</pre> <p>The first line creates an Angular module named <code>app</code>. Modules allow us to organize our code into discrete units more logically. The first argument is simply the name of the module, which is typically <code>app</code> – as shown here – for the module representing the app itself. The second argument, an empty array, indicates that this module doesn’t have dependencies on other modules, which they often will, but not in such a simple example as this.</p>
<p>Next, a component named <code>rootComponent</code> is defined. The approach you can see here is perhaps the simplest – that is, using the <code>template</code> attribute of the object that was passed to <code>app.component()</code> as the second argument. The value of this defines the HTML structure for the<a id="_idIndexMarker665"/> component. It shouldn’t look that different to you than the Vue example from earlier. Once <a id="_idIndexMarker666"/>again, tokens can be inserted into the markup based on the state of the component, which Angular also has a notion of. The <code>style</code> attribute of the first <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element uses Angular’s data binding to set its color based on the <code>textColor</code> property in the scope, which is essentially the same idea as state in React.</p>
<p>The <code>controller</code> function defines the behavior of the component. The <code>$scope</code> argument is an example of Angular’s dependency injection and is created and injected into the controller automatically by the framework when the component is created. The <code>controller</code> function sets up three properties on <code>$scope</code>: <code>message</code>, <code>count</code>, and <code>textColor</code>. These are then used in the component’s template when the component is rendered.</p>
<p>To use this component in an Angular application, you must use the custom <code>&lt;root-component&gt;</code> HTML element. Note that Angular automatically alters the name in this fashion for all components so that you wind up with a consistent naming pattern for your custom components. When Angular runs, it will replace this element with the specified <code>template</code> content, and the controller will manage the component’s behavior, such as when the user clicks the button, triggering a re-render of the component with the updated scope value for the <code>count</code> property.</p>
<p>This is a simple example of Angular’s declarative approach to building UIs, where you define what you want and let the framework handle the DOM manipulations and data bindings. This time, I’ll save a few trees and not drop a screenshot onto the page because it looks no different from the React and Vue examples. But that’s on purpose: this exercise was to show you the same basic example done three ways so that you can compare and contrast them a little bit.</p>
<p>I feel that it’s important to reiterate the point that this is just about as simple as Angular can get. A more full-featured Angular app will be noticeably more complex in many ways and will be written using TS, which we’ll be looking at later in this chapter. So far, we’ve talked about JavaScript<a id="_idIndexMarker667"/> libraries and frameworks, so let’s switch gears and talk about how CSS can be enhanced in a similar way to provide a more robust feature set.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-167"><a id="_idTextAnchor167"/>Boosting CSS capabilities</h1>
<p>While libraries and frameworks such as React and Angular tend to be the big hitters these days and tend to cover<a id="_idIndexMarker668"/> most of the bases in terms of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, there are ways to augment those technologies, such as when using jQuery to augment JavaScript, and leave the other two entirely unchanged. CSS can also be augmented in this way, by using a CSS library. These can be as simple as a stylesheet file you import, or as complex as actually a combination of CSS and JavaScript working together to dynamically generate CSS based on simple configuration on your part.</p>
<p>It’s not impossible or even necessarily unusual to use such a CSS library in conjunction with a framework such as Angular, though that’s becoming less and less common as these frameworks gain more capabilities. But regardless of whether you use them alone or in conjunction with something else, let’s take a look at two of the most popular out there: Bootstrap and Tailwind.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-168"><a id="_idTextAnchor168"/>Examining Bootstrap</h2>
<p><strong class="bold">Bootstrap</strong> is billed as a frontend toolkit, and it is used for developing responsive and mobile-first web pages. It provides a<a id="_idIndexMarker669"/> collection of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript<a id="_idIndexMarker670"/> tools for creating websites and web apps. Bootstrap includes pre-designed components such as buttons, forms, navigation bars, modals, and much more, which can be easily customized. Using Bootstrap is simple, as this example shows:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;A simple Bootstrap example&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"&gt;
    &lt;script src="img/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class="container"&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;My First Bootstrap Example&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#text"&gt;Show Text&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;div id="text" class="collapse"&gt;
        It was the dawn of the third age of mankind, ten years after the Earth/Minbari war. The Babylon Project was a
        dream given form. Its goal: to prevent another war by creating a place where humans and aliens could work out
        their differences peacefully. It's a port of call, home away from home for diplomats, hustlers, entrepreneurs,
        and wanderers. Humans and aliens wrapped in two million, five hundred thousand tons of spinning metal, all alone
        in the night. It can be a dangerous place, but it's our last best hope for peace. This is the story of the last
        of the Babylon stations. The year is 2258. The name of the place is Babylon 5.
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre> <p>All it takes is importing a Bootstrap CSS file, and optionally (though usually) a JavaScript file as well.</p>
<p>Once that’s done, the majority of what you do with Bootstrap is apply style classes, such as <code>container</code>, to say you want a container that will resize based on the available width of the screen, as shown in<a id="_idIndexMarker671"/> the first <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element. The <code>btn</code> class<a id="_idIndexMarker672"/> transforms a regular <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element into a Bootstrap-controlled button, which means you can then apply further styles to it, such as <code>btn-info</code>, which gives us a bluish button with rounded edges, a bit nicer than a typical browser-supplied button.</p>
<p>This makes Bootstrap aware of this button and then allows us to attach behaviors to it by using <code>data-*</code> attributes. Any time you see <code>data-*</code> on a tag, that’s custom data that something else likely depends on. You can add <code>data-*</code> elements like this any time you like, and they have no bearing on the appearance of your markup, at least not directly. The browser simply ignores them because they’re for you, not it.</p>
<p>But when Bootstrap sees those attributes on elements, it knows that you want to do something with it. In this case, <code>data-bs-toggle</code> tells it that you want the button to expand and collapse a section of content, namely the one with an ID of <code>text</code> here, which is then named in the <code>data-bs-target</code> attribute. The <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element that follows the button has an ID of <code>text</code>, and also has the Bootstrap <code>collapse</code> style class applied. The result is that, without having to write any JavaScript or CSS ourselves, we can click the button to expand and collapse the content in that <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Bootstrap is a bit more than just a CSS library. While it certainly does include a lot of CSS styles you can use right out of the box, it also offers components (such as the buttons and collapsible container seen in this sample), various other kinds of containers for doing layouts, including breakpoints for responsive design, and even JavaScript helper functions. It’s also extensible in that you can add plugins to extend its capabilities and themes to change the look and feel of its components wholesale. Bootstrap is also customizable in that you can override most of its styles and change how the results look without much difficulty.</p>
<p>All of this has made Bootstrap popular for a long time, and also because it tends to be quite simple to use but offers a fair bit of power. But its popularity is waning a little bit, in large part because sites built with Bootstrap all tend to look the same since it supplies components that largely define<a id="_idIndexMarker673"/> the look and feel of a site, and people generally don’t like that. While in no way an outright replacement, the new kid on the block, Tailwind, has been gaining developer<a id="_idIndexMarker674"/> mindshare rapidly.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-169"><a id="_idTextAnchor169"/>Examining Tailwind</h2>
<p><strong class="bold">Tailwind</strong> is billed as a utility-first CSS framework <a id="_idIndexMarker675"/>for rapidly building custom designs. Unlike other CSS frameworks, such as Bootstrap, which come with predefined <a id="_idIndexMarker676"/>components, Tailwind provides low-level utility classes only, which lets the developer more easily build completely custom designs without ever leaving your HTML.</p>
<p>Tailwind comes with <em class="italic">a lot</em> more style classes than Bootstrap, which is kind of the point. Rather than drop a <code>btn</code> class on a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element, as in Bootstrap, with Tailwind, you might write something like this:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;A simple Tailwind example&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.0.1/dist/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body class="bg-gray-100"&gt;
    &lt;div class="container mx-auto p-4"&gt;
      &lt;h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4"&gt;My First Tailwind Example&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;button id="toggleButton" class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded"
        onClick="document.getElementById('text').classList.toggle('hidden')"&gt;
        Show Text
      &lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;div id="text" class="mt-4 hidden"&gt;
        It was the dawn of the third age of mankind, ten years after the Earth/Minbari war. The Babylon Project was a
        dream given form. Its goal: to prevent another war by creating a place where humans and aliens could work out
        their differences peacefully. It's a port of call, home away from home for diplomats, hustlers, entrepreneurs,
        and wanderers. Humans and aliens wrapped in two million, five hundred thousand tons of spinning metal, all alone
        in the night. It can be a dangerous place, but it's our last best hope for peace. This is the story of the last
        of the Babylon stations. The year is 2258. The name of the place is Babylon 5.
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre> <p>This example is equivalent to the Bootstrap example, but you can see some key differences. First, Tailwind <a id="_idIndexMarker677"/>only requires us to import a stylesheet, not a JavaScript file, and no jQuery dependency. It’s generally nice to have fewer things to import, but there is a cost here: we don’t get the<a id="_idIndexMarker678"/> automatic expand/collapse functionality like with Bootstrap, and we have to write some JavaScript ourselves for that. That’s down on the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element. In response to the <code>onClick</code> event, we get a reference to the text content by calling <code>document.getElementById()</code>, which returns a DOM node. This has a list of classes applied, and calling <code>toggle()</code> on that list and passing it the name of a class adds or removes it, depending on the current state.</p>
<p>The other thing to notice here, which is the hallmark of Tailwind, is all the style classes applied to the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element (this is true for other elements, but let’s focus on <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>). These are the Tailwind utility-style classes. Rather than a single <code>btn</code> class that has all the styles for a button like<a id="_idIndexMarker679"/> with Bootstrap, instead, you apply just the utility class you want:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>bg-blue-500</code> class gives the button a blue background color</li>
<li> The <code>hover:bg-blue-700</code> class defines a hover pseudo style to make it a different shade of blue when you hover over it</li>
<li>The <code>text-white</code> class makes the text on it white and <code>font-bold</code> bolds it</li>
<li>The <code>py-2</code> class applies padding on the top and bottom</li>
<li>The <code>px-4</code> class applies padding on the left and right around the text in the button</li>
<li>The <code>rounded</code> class gives the button rounded corners</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, you have much<a id="_idIndexMarker680"/> more fine-grained control over how the button looks. You can easily make the text red, for example, or change the amount of padding. With Bootstrap, you would need to override the styles that it provides, but with Tailwind, you only ever get what you want. There are more style classes to deal with – a lot more – but you have more control and flexibility by default, which means with Tailwind, there’s a better chance that your site won’t look like every other one using Tailwind out there.</p>
<p>Now, let’s move on to another topic that largely defines what most people consider modern web development, that being the concept of transpiling, specifically with a tool called Babel.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-170"><a id="_idTextAnchor170"/>Transpiling and data typing</h1>
<p>JavaScript is a fun language in many ways, being extremely flexible and relatively easy to learn. However, while it’s fun to some, to<a id="_idIndexMarker681"/> others, they’ll tell you it’s an absolute nightmare! For that<a id="_idIndexMarker682"/> latter group, the complaints largely come down to one thing:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
let myVar = "abc";
myVar.toUpperCase();
myVar = 123;
myVar.toUpperCase();</pre> <p>This is perfectly valid JavaScript code, but it’s also code that will cause an error. Why? What gives?!</p>
<p>First, the <code>myVar</code> variable is given a value of <code>abc</code>, which is a string. Then, we call the <code>toUpperCase()</code> method on that string, which is a method that all JavaScript strings have to convert into uppercase. After that, the value of <code>myVar</code> is changed to <code>123</code>, which is a number. The error then occurs on the second <code>toUpperCase()</code> call because that method isn’t available on a number.</p>
<p>The problem we’re running into is related to a concept in programming called <strong class="bold">data typing</strong>. It’s the idea that a variable holds some data, and usually, we need to explicitly state in our code what type of data it is. The language often needs to know this because not all operations are valid for all types of data. As described before, you can’t convert a number into uppercase because that doesn’t make logical sense like it does with a string. Therefore, so long as the language <a id="_idIndexMarker683"/>knows what type of data a variable holds, it can proactively inform us<a id="_idIndexMarker684"/> of any mistakes we might make in terms of data typing.</p>
<p>The problem in this example is that JavaScript is what’s called a <em class="italic">dynamically typed</em> language (sometimes called loosely typed), meaning the type of a variable can change on a whim. This is opposed to a <em class="italic">statically typed</em> language (or strongly typed), such as Java, where you have to write code like this:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
String myVar = "abc";
myVar.toUpperCase();
myVar = 123;
myVar.toUpperCase();</pre> <p>Now, the error will occur on the third line. When <code>myVar</code> is declared, in Java, we have to specify a type for it – <code>String</code> – so that Java knows that <code>myVar</code> is only allowed to contain a string. The code won’t even make it to the second call to <code>toUpperCase()</code> because trying to set <code>myVar</code> to <code>123</code> will cause an error.</p>
<p>But here’s the key point: <em class="italic">this error will occur at compile time</em>. You see, JavaScript doesn’t need to be compiled – that is, converted from source code into a form the computer can execute. Instead, the source code itself is executed. JavaScript only has a runtime, meaning when the code runs.</p>
<p>Java, on the other hand, has to be compiled, which is when source code is transformed into another form (in the case of Java, that form is called <strong class="bold">Intermediate Language</strong>, or <strong class="bold">IL</strong> for short) so that it can be executed by the computer. That’s not particularly important for this discussion, but the part that matters is that the error on the third line will be caught when we try to compile the code. In other words, <em class="italic">we would never be able to even try to execute it because the Java compiler won’t even produce IL</em>. It’ll see the error during compilation and tell us about it before it gets that far. This will all happen during your development cycle.</p>
<p>In contrast, you would only find out about the error in the JavaScript code when you go to run it for real. If you’re lucky, this means during development. But what happens if that code doesn’t get executed during development? Maybe it’s in a function that’s rarely used. Now, guess who’s going to find the error? The answer is <em class="italic">your users</em> when they hit that line of code on your live site!</p>
<p>This problem, primarily, is what led<a id="_idIndexMarker685"/> to the creation of something called a <strong class="bold">transpiler</strong>. A transpiler is <a id="_idIndexMarker686"/>like a compiler in that it converts code from one form into another. But while a compile converts<a id="_idIndexMarker687"/> source code into an executable form, a transpiler converts from one form of source code into another.</p>
<p>The other big problem that transpilers can help with is where there are differences in the runtime environment (which usually means a web browser in the case of JavaScript). Transpilers can smooth these over for you. For example, let’s say that Google Chrome supports that <code>toUpperCase()</code> method on strings, but maybe you find that Firefox doesn’t (don’t worry – they both do support it!). You could certainly write some code like this:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
if (running_in_chrome) {
  myVar.toUpperCase();
} else {
  myOwnFunctionToDoUpperCase(myVar);
}</pre> <p>You would then have to figure out how to determine whether your code is running in Chrome or Firefox (giving a <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> value to that <code>running_in_chrome </code>variable), so you would have to write the code for <code>myOwnFunctionToDoUpperCase()</code> yourself, which does the equivalent of <code>toUpperCase()</code>. In this case, that’s not all that tall of an order, but you can imagine not all cases being quite so easy. This technique<a id="_idIndexMarker688"/> is called <strong class="bold">polyfill</strong>: writing code that allows you to use modern browser features in browsers that don’t yet support it.</p>
<p>A transpiler essentially does this work for you. With a transpiler, it will see that the <code>toUpperCase()</code> function is used, recognize that it won’t work in the browser you specify that you want your code to work in, and automatically <a id="_idIndexMarker689"/>add the necessary polyfill. It will produce JavaScript <a id="_idIndexMarker690"/>that will work across all browsers that way. Yes, it’s converting JavaScript into JavaScript, but modified JavaScript on the output side.</p>
<p>For now, though, let’s talk about perhaps the most famous transpiler out there, certainly in the realm of web development: Babel.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-171"><a id="_idTextAnchor171"/>Introducing Babel</h2>
<p>Babel is a JavaScript transpiler that allows you to use next-generation JavaScript today. It converts newer forms of JavaScript code into a backward-compatible version for older browsers or environments (such as Node). Key features include transforming syntax (for example, converting functions<a id="_idIndexMarker691"/> in the <code>() =&gt; { }</code> form into the original <code>function xxx() { }</code> form), polyfilling features that are missing in your target environment, and source code transformations (typically things such as applying specific coding standards to make all your source code look the same). Babel is widely used in web development to ensure broad compatibility and to leverage the latest JavaScript features while maintaining support for older platforms.</p>
<p>Some of the key points about Babel are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic">Plugins and presets</em>: Babel’s functionality can be extended through plugins. For example, things such as JSX can be supported through plugins. Presets essentially combine many different configuration options into a single option. For example, the <code>@babel/preset-env</code> preset will provide support for modern browsers without you having to configure every available option.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Configuration</em>: Babel can be configured by creating a <code>.babelrc</code> file, or by adding a babel section in a <code>package.json</code> file. This configuration specifies the presets and plugins to be used, as well as other available options.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Integration with build tools</em>: Babel is used by bundlers such as Webpack, Rollup, and Vite. Babel provides a lot of the functionality these bundlers offer (certainly not all of it, of course).</li>
<li><em class="italic">Community and ecosystem</em>: Babel has a large community and ecosystem, with many third-party plugins and tools available. This makes it a versatile tool that can adapt to many different project requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Babel’s role is crucial in<a id="_idIndexMarker692"/> ensuring that developers can use the latest JavaScript features without sacrificing compatibility, making it a cornerstone of modern web development.</p>
<p>As useful and powerful as Babel is, you may have noticed that it doesn’t solve the type problem. JavaScript is still loosely typed, despite all that Babel can do for you. To solve that problem, we need to look at something else called TS, and the transpiler it provides, which can take the place of Babel (though Babel can handle TS too!).</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-172"><a id="_idTextAnchor172"/>Introducing TS</h2>
<p>TypeScript, or TS for short, is a product <a id="_idIndexMarker693"/>of Microsoft. It’s a programming language that is a superset of JavaScript, meaning it adds new features to JavaScript, most importantly static typing. This helps catch errors early in development. You transpile it to plain JavaScript so that it can run anywhere JavaScript does. TS is popular for large-scale projects due to its robust tooling and ability to make code more maintainable and understandable, but it’s certainly not just for big, enterprise projects!</p>
<p>TS isn’t just about static typing though – it has<a id="_idIndexMarker694"/> other benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic">Interfaces and classes</em>: TS supports <strong class="bold">object-oriented programming</strong> (<strong class="bold">OOP</strong>) concepts such as interfaces <a id="_idIndexMarker695"/>and classes, making it easier to structure complex systems and enforce contracts between different parts of your code. This is a more advanced topic that I won’t be covering in this book, but it’s something important for TS to support (JavaScript supports classes natively, though TS enhances this a fair bit).</li>
<li><em class="italic">Advanced types</em>: TS includes advanced types such as enums, tuples, and generics, allowing for more precise and flexible code (these, too, are more advanced topics not covered in this book).</li>
<li><em class="italic">Type inference</em>: TS can often infer types, reducing the need to explicitly annotate code. This means that you don’t <em class="italic">always</em> have to specify a type because TS can oftentimes figure out what the right type is on its own.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Compatibility with JS</em>: TS is a superset of JavaScript, so any valid JavaScript code is also valid TS code. This makes it easier to adopt incrementally if you have an existing JavaScript code base that you want to convert into TS. You don’t need to do it all at once, which is very helpful if it’s a large code base.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Tooling</em>: TS offers powerful tools<a id="_idIndexMarker696"/> for large projects, such as auto-completion, navigation, and refactoring, owing to its high level of support in IDEs and other developer tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let’s take a look at TS in action.</p>
<h3>A simple TS example</h3>
<p>To get started with TS, the first step is<a id="_idIndexMarker697"/> installing the TS compiler (well, really transpiler). To do so, start by using <code>npm init</code> in a new project with npm, then install TS itself:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
npm install --save-dev typescript</pre> <p>As before, this has already been done in the <code>ch-06/typescript</code> directory. In that same directory, you’ll find a file called <code>example.ts</code>. To compile it, execute this command:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
npx tsc example.ts</pre> <p>The <code>tsc</code> command is the TS compiler. It will produce an <code>example.js</code> file, transpiling our TS code into pure JavaScrfipt. You can then run that JavaScript file (which you could not do with the TS file – go ahead and try it!) with Node:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
node example.js</pre> <p>Now, let’s look at the code in <code>example.ts</code>. This is our actual TS source code:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
class Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  constructor(inName: string, inAge: number) {
    this.name = inName;
    this.age = inAge;
  }
  speak(wisdom: string) {
    console.log(`Hello! My name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old. A bit of wisdom for you: ${wisdom}.`);
  }
}
let p: Person = new Person("Xander", 36);
p.speak("Man has not evolved an inch from the primordial slime that spawned him");</pre> <p>The first thing we did is create a class. This is part of OOP that I mentioned earlier, and in simple terms, a class is a blueprint. It defines a thing that we can then create instances of earlier. Here, we have a <code>Person</code> class. Classes usually hold some kind of data, in fields, and here, there <a id="_idIndexMarker698"/>are two: <code>name</code> and <code>age</code>. This is also the first time you can see some data types being used: the part after the field name and semicolon is the type of that field. So, we’re saying that the name field must be a <code>string</code> type, and the age field must be a <code>number</code> type.</p>
<p>Next, we need to add a function to the class. In this case, it’s a special function named <code>constructor()</code>. A constructor is a function in a class that will be executed whenever we create an instance of that class (and you can have multiple instances of a class in most cases). This particular function takes in two arguments, <code>inName</code> and <code>inAge</code>. And here, again, types – which are referred to as <code>inName</code>, we’ll get an error when we compile this code. Inside the function, the values of the <code>name</code> and <code>age</code> fields are set to the values that were passed in (<code>inName</code> and <code>inAge</code>, respectively). Writing <code>this</code> before the field names means that we’re setting the value on the instance of the class created later.</p>
<p>Next, we add another function, this one named <code>speak()</code>. This will output a simple string telling us the person’s<a id="_idIndexMarker700"/> name, how old the person is, and a little bit of wisdom we’ll provide later. This just uses basic string interpolation to output the value of the fields, again referenced using <code>this</code>.</p>
<p>Now, we’ve defined the <code>Person</code> class, but on its own, that does nothing. We have to make use of this class by creating one or more instances of it. That’s the first line of code after the end of the class definition. Here, a variable named <code>p</code> is defined, and we apply a type annotation of the <code>Person</code> type. To create an instance of a class, we use the <code>new Person()</code> code as the value of the variable, and pass <code>name</code> and <code>age</code> values to it. This executes that <code>constructor()</code> function, and we now have a <code>Person</code> object referenced by the <code>p</code> variable with the <code>name</code> field having a value of “Xander” and the <code>age</code> field with a value of 36.</p>
<p>Finally, we want to make Xander speak, so we call the <code>speak()</code> method on <code>p</code>, passing it the bit of wisdom to show via <code>console.log()</code> (a witty bit of dialogue from an old movie named <em class="italic">Jekyll and Hyde… Together Again</em> – check it out, it’s funny!).</p>
<p>Now, let’s see what the results of compiling that TS code are in the <code>example.js</code> file that’s created:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
var Person = /** @class */ (function () {
    function Person(inName, inAge) {
        this.name = inName;
        this.age = inAge;
    }
    Person.prototype.speak = function (wisdom) {
        console.log("Hello! My name is ".concat(this.name, " and I am ").concat(this.age, " years old. A bit of wisdom for you: ").concat(wisdom, "."));
    };
    return Person;
}());
var p = new Person("Xander", 36);
p.speak("Man has not evolved an inch from the primordial slime that spawned him");</pre> <p>Well, that looks a bit <a id="_idIndexMarker701"/>different, doesn’t it? The differences start with that first line. Since classes may not be natively supported by the browser (or version of Node) that runs this code, <code>tsc</code> has used a trick called an <strong class="bold">IIFE</strong>, which stands for <strong class="bold">Immediately Invoked Function Expression</strong>. This is a nifty little trick where you create a function (an<a id="_idIndexMarker702"/> anonymous function, because it doesn’t have a name), and then immediately call it while wrapping that execution in parenthesis. Here’s the basic form of this technique in plain JavaScript and without all the preceding code to confuse matters:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
(function() {
  // Do something
}());</pre> <p>The reason we do this is so that everything inside the enclosing parenthesis creates what we call a <code>Person</code>, and then returning it, which is assigned to the <code>Person</code> variable outside. If we didn’t return it, then it wouldn’t be accessible to code outside the enclosing parenthesis. The result is the equivalent in JavaScript of defining a class in TS, but as you can see, it’s a bit more code.</p>
<p>By the way, the <code>/** @class */</code> line in the <code>example.js</code> code is a hint to certain tools (some of which are discussed in the next chapter) that help it do its job. They’re markers – that is, signs that provide some metadata to the tools. In this case, they’re telling it this is a class.</p>
<p>Inside the IIFE, you can see how the <code>speak()</code> function is added to the <code>Person</code> function. This is a thing you can do in JavaScript because functions are objects. Every object has a prototype, which conceptually is the same as a class in OOP: it’s a blueprint from which all instances come, so anything that prototype has, all the instances of it will also have. So, with the <code>Person.prototype.speak</code> code, we’re saying that we want to add a thing called <code>speak</code> to all instances of <code>Person</code>, and the thing we want speak to is the function we assign to it.</p>
<p>Then, inside that <code>speak()</code> function, you can see how <code>tsc</code> has replaced our string interpolation tokens with the <code>concat()</code> function, which is a function JavaScript provides on strings to cram them together. Since string interpolation is a somewhat newer feature of JavaScript, it may not be supported yet in some browsers of versions of Node. <code>tsc</code> knows this by default and polyfills them with the use of <code>concat()</code> instead.</p>
<p>Note that all the type<a id="_idIndexMarker703"/> annotations have been removed throughout this code. That’s because they would be syntax errors in pure JavaScript, and anyway, they aren’t needed anymore. Remember that the whole point of TS is to catch data typing errors at compile time, so after the code is compiled (transpiled, really) to JavaScript, they no longer serve a purpose anyway.</p>
<p>From this relatively simple example, you can get a sense of TS. You can see how it is just an extension of JavaScript, including building classes and annotating things with types.</p>
<p>Now would be a good time to see why we want to do this, and what happens when you have a data typing issue. So, after the last line of code, add this one:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
p = "abc";</pre> <p>Then, execute <code>npx tsc example.ts</code> again; you should see an error telling you about the mistake and exactly where it is. This is the big thing TS is about: that error won’t occur when your site is live, and there isn’t any mystery about what the error is given the message <code>tsc</code> gives you. It’s a big benefit, and it’s why TS has rapidly become almost the de facto way modern website code is written. It’s getting more and more rare to see people writing “naked” JavaScript.</p>
<p>TS is a far more robust language than I’m showing here, but it would take far more pages than this to detail it all. As with the overarching theme of this book, I’m not trying to teach you every last detail of TS – I’m just introducing the concept and giving you some foundation of understanding.</p>
<p>Now that you know about transpilers and TS, let’s look at a category of tools that can make use of both, namely bundlers.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-173"><a id="_idTextAnchor173"/>Packing up and going – bundlers</h1>
<p>There was a time when web development <a id="_idIndexMarker704"/>was easy. You’d create some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, import the CSS and JavaScript files into your page, and you were good to go. After a while, though, things got much more complex. This JavaScript file depended on that one, and maybe parts of a given library you were using weren’t even needed, so why bother loading it on your page?</p>
<p>When your project outgrows one or two source files, matters get complicated very quickly if you want to keep some semblance of sanity while ensuring the optimal performance of your website.</p>
<p>Managing all that complexity is where something called a <strong class="bold">bundler</strong> comes into the picture.</p>
<p>The overall purpose of a bundler – which typically is just a command-line interface tool – is to streamline and optimize the process of turning your development code into a production-ready package. This typically involves combining multiple JavaScript files into a single JavaScript file that has all unnecessary code removed. This can also involve things such as combining CSS files, converting images into JavaScript structure, transpiling TS and JSX into JavaScript, and much more.</p>
<p>Here are some of the key reasons why bundlers are important to modern web development:</p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic">Handling dependencies</em>: Modern websites and apps often use a variety of libraries, frameworks, and toolkits. Bundlers manage these dependencies efficiently, ensuring that everything your app needs is included in your final build artifact and nothing unnecessary bloats the final product.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Module bundling</em>: JavaScript has evolved to use modules, which is a way to better organize your code, but browsers have varying levels of support for module systems. Bundlers can take modules written in different formats and combine them into a single file, or a few files that work universally. We call these files <strong class="bold">bundles</strong>, but at the end of the day, they’re nothing but JavaScript files, though they can include things other than JavaScript in some cases – things such as images and CSS files can be converted into a form of JavaScript so that only a single file has to be requested when your website loads rather than multiple if these things were separate files.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Performance optimization</em>: Bundlers minify and compress your code, which reduces load times for your users. This includes tree shaking (hold that thought!), splitting code into smaller chunks for faster loading, and optimizing asset loading, like images and stylesheets.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Development efficiency</em>: Bundlers often come with features such as hot reloading, which allows you to see changes in real time without a full page reload. This speeds up development and debugging. They also typically include a built-in development server, which saves you from having to set up a web server (as simple as that can be, as you saw earlier).</li>
<li><em class="italic">Transpilation support</em>: They also integrate with tools such as Babel to allow you to use more modern JavaScript <a id="_idIndexMarker705"/>features that aren’t yet supported in all browsers, ensuring compatibility.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Environment variables</em>: Bundlers allow you to use different settings or configurations, depending on whether you’re in development or production. In other words, just by setting a variable in, say, a configuration file, a bundler can know to perform other steps that you would only want to be done in your final, ready-for-the-real-world product.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bundlers work by building a <em class="italic">dependency graph</em>. This is a fancy way of saying that it scans all the source files for your project and determines what code depends on what other code. It then uses a technique called <em class="italic">tree shaking</em> to <a id="_idIndexMarker706"/>get rid of what isn’t needed. It’s a lot like when you go to cut down a Christmas tree and they put the tree in those machines that shake the tree so any loose branches and such fall out. With tree shaking, unused code can be removed safely.</p>
<p>The output of this process is one or more JavaScript files that are highly optimized and contain only what your website needs to work. That means the files will load faster since there’s less to transfer over the network, and the browser can use them more efficiently since there’s less code for it to deal with. In addition, things such as CSS and even images can be embedded in these JavaScript files, which means that when your HTML page is loaded, fewer requests need to be made, further leading to improved performance.</p>
<p>There are a few big names in bundlers today, including Webpack, Rollup, and Vite. They all have the same basic goal and work in similar ways, but they have their differences too.</p>
<p>Webpack is kind of the village elder <a id="_idIndexMarker707"/>at this point, being one of the first bundlers (though not the first: that honor goes to Browserify in 2011) and certainly the most successful and well-known at the time of writing. You configure it using JSON files, telling it about your project’s structure and defining what you want it to do when you bundle your project. It has a large number of plugins available to extend its capabilities. For example, <code>HtmlWebpackPlugin</code> can save you the effort of even writing an HTML file yourself, creating it for you on the fly. <code>ImageMinimizerWebpackPlugin</code> can compress images so that they are smaller in size, thereby making them load faster. There are around 30 official plugins and probably another dozen or so created by the Webpack community of users. It is a full-featured bundler that can do practically everything a bundler should.</p>
<p>But it’s fallen out of favor a little bit due to the emergence of rivals such as Vite and Rollup. These two seek to outdo Webpack in terms of being simpler to configure, easier to understand overall (Webpack can sometimes be a challenge to follow mentally), and often faster and more lightweight. All of them provide a plugin ecosystem, basic module bundling, and the ability to act as a development web server for you as you code, and they can all do what’s called <strong class="bold">code splitting</strong>, which is<a id="_idIndexMarker708"/> dividing up your code into logical units that you can then only load when necessary rather than just loading everything upfront when it may not yet be needed (and may <em class="italic">never</em> be needed).</p>
<p>While all three serve the same basic purpose and have a lot in common, they also have their differences (and to state the obvious: I’m talking in broad generalities here):</p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic">Comprehensiveness</em>: While Vite and Rollup provide a lot of the same functionality, Webpack tends to offer a bit more, owing to its age. Webpack is a full-featured bundler, handling a wide range of tasks beyond just bundling (such as asset management and loader transformations).</li>
<li><em class="italic">Configuration</em>: Webpack is known for being highly configurable, but this can be complex and overwhelming. Vite and Rollup tend to be simpler, sometimes greatly so. They do this largely by having intelligent defaults, which means you simply tend to have to write your own configuration less with these than with Webpack.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Build time</em>: Webpack will generally have the slowest build times compared to Vite and Rollup, especially the larger a project gets.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Development experience</em>: Vite and Rollup support <strong class="bold">hot module replacement</strong> (<strong class="bold">HMR</strong>), better than Webpack, which<a id="_idIndexMarker709"/> means that as you develop with these tools you can have a better experience when your code changes since reloading things will largely be handled automatically. While Webpack can do some of this too, Vite and Rollup tend to be better at it, especially with more modern code bases.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Output efficiency</em>: Vite, and especially Rollup, tend to do a better job at optimizing output bundles than Webpack.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Overhead</em>: Vite and Rollup don’t include as many built-in features as Webpack, leading to less overhead <a id="_idIndexMarker710"/>but potentially more manual setup for complex tasks. They are very much 80/20 tools, meaning they’ll do 80% of the work you need them to do very easily, but the last 20% can be rather difficult (whereas Webpack tends to be more difficult – relatively speaking – all the time).</li>
</ul>
<p>While bundlers are very common in modern web development, they are a slightly more advanced topic because they are always optional. First, you may not need what they provide at all. Second, even if you do, you could simply write things such as shell scripts, batch files, or simple Python or Node scripts to do what they do in a way more specific to your needs. However, they do provide a lot of features and capabilities that modern web developers need, which is why they have become so popular over the years.</p>
<p>In summary, bundlers are a good thing because they handle the complexities of modern web development, optimize performance, and enhance the development experience, making it easier to build sophisticated and efficient websites and web apps.</p>

<p>This time around, you’ve uncovered the <strong class="bold">Frameworks</strong>, <strong class="bold">TypeScript</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Bundlers</strong> boxes. There’s not many left now, is there? Woo-hoo!</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-175"><a id="_idTextAnchor175"/>Summary</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we looked at some of the tools that, in general terms, make up what we think of as <em class="italic">modern</em> web development. This includes libraries such as React and Vue (and also jQuery, though that one isn’t considered modern anymore), frameworks such as Angular, and meta frameworks such as Next. We looked at some CSS tools too, Bootstrap and Tailwind in particular. All of these were shown to provide a lot of benefits in terms of writing as little code as possible to get the job done, improving delivery velocity and robustness of the end product.</p>
<p>We also talked about TS and Babel, and you learned how data typing is a benefit in modern development, but at the cost of the need to transpile.</p>
<p>Finally, we talked about some modern build tools such as packers and bundlers, and how they help you deploy just the code you need and remove a lot of the tedium of building your application.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we’ll jump back to the server side of things and talk about some other technologies besides Node that you might choose to build your server-side code with. This will include PHP, Python (a bit more), Java, and its popular Spring Boot framework, and .NET. We’ll also talk about some general topics that are very important on the server side, including databases and something called REST APIs.</p>
<p>Grab a quick snack and a drink (alcoholic or non-alcoholic is entirely up to you!) and come right back here for the next exciting chapter!</p>
