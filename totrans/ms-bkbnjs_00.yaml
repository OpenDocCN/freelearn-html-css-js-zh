- en: Backbone is an amazing library to build web applications; it's small, simple,
    and yet powerful. It provides a set of small and focused objects to be used as
    bricks when building frontend applications.

- en: The beauty of Backbone is that it gives you the freedom to build your applications
    with your rules. However, with great power comes great responsibility; Backbone
    does not tell you anything about how to structure your applications. Keep in mind
    that Backbone is not a framework but a library.

- en: After years of working with Backbone projects, making code experiments, and
    exploring code from other developers, I have identified patterns and best practices
    when building frontend web apps with Backbone.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book explains how to give structure to your applications. It gives you
    the tools and strategies to create robust and maintainable web apps. It will help
    you define and assign the right responsibilities to the Backbone objects and define
    a new set of glue objects.

- en: In the book, you will build a functional application applying the concepts that
    are exposed here. The application is simple enough to put in to practice the core
    concepts when building scalable frontend applications with Backbone. At any time,
    you can see the project code in the book repository at [https://github.com/abiee/mastering-backbone](https://github.com/abiee/mastering-backbone).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Architecture of a Backbone application"),
    *Architecture of a Backbone application*, deals with the project organization
    at two levels: logical and physical. On the logical side, you will learn how to
    connect the Backbone objects, while on the physical side, you will see where to
    put your scripts.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Managing Views"), *Managing views*, helps
    you extract the common patterns of views and create a new set of general purpose
    views that can be used on any Backbone application. These views will remove a
    lot of boilerplate code when managing views.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Model Bindings"), *Model bindings*, explains
    how to deal with complex REST resources and helps you handle embedded resources
    and keep it in sync with views.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Modular Code"), *Modular code*, covers dependency
    management and script bundling with Browserify. Modern applications are becoming
    more JavaScript-intensive, so it''s a good idea to handle dependencies in a smarter
    way.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Dealing with Files"), *Dealing with files*,
    it covers the common requirement for web applications to upload files to a server,
    this chapter tells you how to do it in Backbone with a REST server.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Store data in the Browser"), *Store data
    in the browser*, shows you how to store data in the browser and how to do it from
    a Backbone perspective. The chapter shows how to build two drivers to transparently
    store Backbone models in localStorage and indexedDB instead of a remote server.
    This can be useful if you want to create offline applications.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Build Like a Pro"), *Build like a pro*, tells
    you how you can automatize common and repetitive tasks in a script. It will dramatically
    improve your productivity. It describes how you can build a development workflow
    that automatically refreshes your project every time you make a small change.'

- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Testing Backbone Applications"), *Testing
    Backbone applications*, shows you the strategies and best practices when testing
    frontend code.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Deploying to Production"), *Deploy to production*,
    shows you how to deploy the project to a production server. While high-demand
    applications need a sophisticated platform, this chapter gives you the starting
    point for small apps.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 10](ch10.html "Chapter 10. Authentication"), *Security*, teaches you
    how to authenticate against the REST servers and how to manage sessions from the
