It was the first browser-based scripting language and ran only in Netscape Navigator at the time, but it eventually found its way into most other web browsers. Back then, web pages consisted almost entirely of static markup. JavaScript (initially named LiveScript) emerged around the need to make pages dynamic and to bring the power of a full scripting language to browser developers.</p><p>A lot of the design decisions of the language were driven by the need of simplicity and ease of use, although at the time, some were made for pure marketing reasons at Netscape. The name "JavaScript" was chosen to associate it with Java from Sun Microsystems, despite the fact that Sun really had nothing to do with it and that it's conceptually quite different from its namesake.</p><p>Except in one way, that is, most of its syntax was borrowed from Java, and also C and C++, so as to be familiar to the programmers coming from these languages. But despite looking similar, it is in fact a very different beast under the hood and shares characteristics with the more exotic languages such as Self, Scheme, and Smalltalk. Among these are dynamic typing, prototypical inheritance, first class functions, and closures.</p><p>So we ended up with a language that looked a lot like some of the mainstream languages at the time and could be coaxed into acting a lot like them, but with quite different central ideas. This has caused it to be very misunderstood for many years. A lot of programmers never saw it as being a "serious" programming language and thus didn't apply a lot of the best development practices built up over decades when it came to writing browser code.</p><p>Those who did delve further into the language were sure to find a lot of strangeness. Eich himself admitted that the language was prototyped within about 10 days, and even though what he came up with was impressive, JavaScript isn't without (many) warts. These too didn't really help to raise its profile.</p><p>Despite all these issues, JavaScript still became one of the most widely used programming languages in the world, if not merely because of the explosion of the Internet and the spread of web browsers. Support across a multitude of browsers would seem to be a great thing, but it also caused havoc because of differences in implementations, both in the language and the DOM.</p><p>Around 2005, the term AJAX was coined to describe a style of JavaScript programming that was made possible by the introduction of the <code class="literal">XMLHTTPRequest</code> object in browsers. This meant that developers could write client-side code that could communicate with the server using HTTP directly, and update page elements without reloading the page. This was really a turning point in the history of the language. All of a sudden, it was being used in "serious" web applications, and people began to see the language in a different light.</p><p>In 2006, John Resig released jQuery to the world. It was designed to simplify client-side scripting, DOM manipulation, and AJAX, as well as to abstract away many of the inconsistencies across browsers. It became an essential tool for many JavaScript programmers. To date, it is used on 55 percent of the top 10, 000 websites in the world.</p><p>In 2009, Ryan Dahl created Node.js, an event-driven network application framework written on top of the Google V8 JavaScript engine. It quickly became very popular, especially for writing web server applications. A big factor in its success has been the fact that you could now write JavaScript on the server, as well as in the browser. An elaborate and distinguished community has sprung up around the framework, and at present the future of Node.js is looking very bright.</p><p>Early in 2010, Jeremy Ashkenas created CoffeeScript, a language that compiles to JavaScript. Its goal is to create cleaner, more concise, and more idiomatic JavaScript and to make it easier to use the better features and patterns of the language. It does away with a lot of the syntactic cruft of JavaScript, reducing the line noise and generally creating much shorter and clearer code.</p><p>Influenced by languages such as Ruby, Python, and Haskell, it borrows some of the powerful and interesting features of these languages. Although it can look quite different, the CoffeeScript code generally maps to its generated JavaScript pretty closely. It has grown to be an overnight success, quickly being adopted by the Node.js community as well as being included in Ruby on Rails 3.1.</p><p>Brendan Eich has also expressed his admiration for CoffeeScript, and has used it as an example of some of the things he would like to see in the future versions of JavaScript.</p><p>This book serves as an introduction to the language as well as a motivation for why you should write CoffeeScript instead of JavaScript wherever you can. It also then explores using CoffeeScript in the browser using jQuery and Ruby on Rails, as well as on the server using Node.js.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Why CoffeeScript?">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Why CoffeeScript?</em>, introduces CoffeeScript and delves deeper into the differences between it and JavaScript, specifically focusing on the parts of JavaScript that CoffeeScript aims to improve.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Running CoffeeScript">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Running CoffeeScript</em>, goes into a short introduction of the CoffeeScript stack and how it's typically packaged. You will learn how to install CoffeeScript on Windows, Mac, and Linux using Node.js and npm. You will get to know the CoffeeScript compiler (<code class="literal">coffee</code>) as well as get familiar with some helpful tools and resources for day-to-day development in CoffeeScript.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. CoffeeScript and jQuery">Chapter 3</a>, <em>CoffeeScript and jQuery</em>, introduces client-side development using jQuery and CoffeeScript. We also start implementing a sample application for this book using these technologies.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. CoffeeScript and Rails">Chapter 4</a>, <em>CoffeeScript and Rails</em>, starts with a brief overview of Ruby on Rails, and its history with JavaScript frameworks. We are introduced to the Asset Pipeline in Rails 3.1 and how it integrates with CoffeeScript and jQuery. We then move to adding a backend to our sample application using Rails.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. CoffeeScript and Node.js">Chapter 5</a>, <em>CoffeeScript and Node.js</em>, starts with a brief overview of Node.js, its history, and philosophy. It then demonstrates how easy it is to write server-side code in CoffeeScript using Node.js. We then implement the final piece of the sample application using WebSockets and Node.js.</p></div></div>
