A visualization should tell a story using data and should look good doing it. You want to pull in and intrigue viewers with your aesthetics and expose the world with your story.</p><p>To be perfectly honest, this chapter seemed the most difficult one to write. But what sort of book about making beautiful visualizations would this be if we didn't talk about what makes a visualization gorgeous and effective?</p><p>I'm a programmer, not a designer, but I've gone through a lot of visualizations, good and bad. Let me show you some I've found amazing.</p><div class="section" title="What is a visualization?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec27"/>What is a visualization?</h1></div></div></div><p>A visualization <a id="id345" class="indexterm"/>is just a picture based on data. Any time you take data and turn it into a picture, you've created a visualization.</p><p>As <span class="emphasis"><em>Economic and Industrial Delusions: A Discussion of the Case for Protection</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Farquhar, Arthur B</em></span>—a classic book from the 19th century—puts it:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>"The graphical method has considerable superiority for the exposition of statistical facts over the tabular. A heavy bank of figures is grievously wearisome to the eye and the popular mind is as incapable of drawing any useful lessons from it as of extracting sunbeams from cucumbers"</p></blockquote></div><p>But there is a world of difference between charts and graphs of old and the visual masterpieces from the examples gallery of d3.js. The new medium lets us do so much more with data that the growth in popularity of visualizations is hardly surprising.</p><p>Compared to a good modern visualization, a chart barely goes beyond showing raw data. It doesn't tell you anything, but a visualization does.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/0007OS_06_01.jpg" alt="What is a visualization?"/></div><p>You don't even have to go full out. Sometimes, adding labels is enough to turn a boring graph into an appealing visualization—a trick often used by <span class="emphasis"><em>The New York Times</em></span>.</p><p>A simple<a id="id346" class="indexterm"/> graph of just two exponentially rising lines: boring. Add some labels and it's a gripping tale. An explanation of what you're seeing placed at the top-left corner of the graph, highlighted story points on the graph, and even the legend comes with an interesting point on the story.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Amanda Cox</em></span>, a graphics editor for<span class="emphasis"><em> The New York Times</em></span>, calls this the annotation layer. Look her up; she's done some great talks about visualizations.</p><p>Contrast this with our visualizations so far. They are interesting and have a good wow effect, but are not very good at conveying a story. They were great as examples and made decent art, but we often just didn't have time to label them properly.</p><p>Even better, look at this visualization referenced in d3.js's documentation on stacked layouts.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/0007OS_06_02.jpg" alt="What is a visualization?"/></div><p>Beautiful! Would you guess that it shows the seasonal ebb and flow of colors in photos from Flickr? Probably not.</p><p>With help from a designer, the authors improved this concept for the final print version in <span class="emphasis"><em>Boston</em></span> magazine by labeling the circular time axis and adding typical photos to key points of the image.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/0007OS_06_03.jpg" alt="What is a visualization?"/></div><p>It seems good visualizations find a balance in the happy medium between static charts and data art. A good visualization should be as beautiful as it is informative.</p></div></div></div>


  <div id="sbo-rt-content"><div class="section" title="Some great examples"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec28"/>Some great examples</h1></div></div></div><p>A lot of hard academic<a id="id347" class="indexterm"/> research is going into <a id="id348" class="indexterm"/>visualization design. Reading some of the material is a great idea when you're looking for something specific—like how best to transition between a scatterplot and a histogram (<a class="ulink" href="http://vis.berkeley.edu/papers/animated_transitions/">http://vis.berkeley.edu/papers/animated_transitions/</a>)—but coming up to speed on such a vast field takes time.</p><p>For an exhaustive look at visualization methods, take a look at the periodic table of visualizations developed by the KPI Library. You can find it at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.visual-literacy.org/periodic_table/periodic_table.html">http://www.visual-literacy.org/periodic_table/periodic_table.html</a>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/0007OS_06_04.jpg" alt="Some great examples"/></div><p>The periodic table uses six categories—<span class="strong"><strong>Data</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Information</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Concept</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Strategy</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Metaphor</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Compound</strong></span> visualization. Hovering over a cell shows an example category.</p><p>The table itself is a well-done visualization. It may not be beautiful or artistic, but emulates the common periodic table perfectly. It immediately draws our attention and sticks in our mind because of the familiarity, and presents the data well. On the other hand, there's too much going on and there is no emphasis. Rather than a story, you get a "here's everything; deal with it".</p><p>On top of it all, this periodic table is a bitmap image—that's something you should never do on the Web for reasons ranging from search engines to usability.</p><div class="section" title="Riot arrests"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec31"/>Riot arrests</h2></div></div></div><p>How <span class="emphasis"><em>The Guardian</em></span> covered the riot arrests<a id="id349" class="indexterm"/> during the 2012 London riots is an example of a simple yet powerful visualization.</p><p>Histograms are the obvious choice for comparing category sizes, but you run into the problem of people seeing trends that aren't there. People are also forced to read the labels because all the bars look alike.</p><p>Histograms break down further when you want to compare subcategories or they just show the sum of all categories.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/0007OS_06_05.jpg" alt="Riot arrests"/></div><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>The Guardian</em></span> used<a id="id350" class="indexterm"/> color to differentiate categories and circle area to show the size of these categories. This works because, through years of graphs and charts, everyone's learned that colors are categories. Even before seeing the numbers, readers recognize that a bigger circle is a bigger category. Just be careful to use area to represent values, not diameter—a diameter half as big produces a circle only a quarter as big!</p><p>The only information that isn't obvious at a glance is that the smaller circles are subcategories of the central big circle. This question is quickly answered by clicking on any of the smaller circles.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/0007OS_06_06.jpg" alt="Riot arrests"/></div><p>You can find this visualization at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/datablog/interactive/2011/dec/06/england-riots-crimes-arrested">http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/datablog/interactive/2011/dec/06/england-riots-crimes-arrested</a>.</p></div><div class="section" title="Les Misérables Co-occurrence"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec32"/>Les Misérables Co-occurrence</h2></div></div></div><p>Another great use of <a id="id351" class="indexterm"/>color is displaying intensity. This approach is most often used in matrix diagrams where darker means more and lighter means less. It's a very natural effect—empty cells are white, and the more points you put in a cell, the darker it becomes. Try it with a pen.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Mike Bostock</em></span> used this effect in the Les Misérables diagram that's showing characters appearing in the same chapter.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/0007OS_06_07.jpg" alt="Les Misérables Co-occurrence"/></div><p>Unlike graphs and trees, matrix diagrams don't become too busy with a lot of connections. Remember our chord diagram, the unreadable jungle of thin connections? That doesn't happen here.</p><p>Matrix diagrams are, however, sensitive to edge ordering. When the edges are ordered with a clustering algorithm—community discovery—we get a beautiful picture.</p><p>But the matrix looks very different with alphabetical edges.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/0007OS_06_08.jpg" alt="Les Misérables Co-occurrence"/></div><p>It is a lot messier <a id="id352" class="indexterm"/>and paints a worse picture than the clustered version.</p><p>Another problem that matrix diagrams suffer from is that following a path between two nodes is almost impossible. Choose your visualization wisely.</p><p>You can find the <span class="emphasis"><em>Les Misérables Co-occurrence</em></span> matrix at <a class="ulink" href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/miserables/">http://bost.ocks.org/mike/miserables/</a>.</p></div><div class="section" title="The Wealth &amp; Health of Nations"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec33"/>The Wealth &amp; Health of Nations</h2></div></div></div><p>Another interesting <a id="id353" class="indexterm"/>problem faced by visualizations is packing too many dimensions into a two-dimensional medium. How would you plot the relationship between per capita income and life expectancy of a nation? A simple line chart, right? But how do you incorporate time, add more nations, population, and... let's add region just to make things interesting. That's five dimensions!</p><p>Gapminder's Wealth &amp; Health of Nations is a beautiful example of squeezing five dimensions into two without crowding. Every nation is a bubble on a graph, where the vertical axis shows life expectancy and the horizontal axis is per capita income. Time is shown as time with an<a id="id354" class="indexterm"/> animation, regions are colors, and population is circle area.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/0007OS_06_09.jpg" alt="The Wealth &amp; Health of Nations"/></div><p>Maybe I get too excited by data, but watching those dots dance around and grow bigger as time goes by is really fun. You can explore histories of whole nations!</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/0007OS_06_10.jpg" alt="The Wealth &amp; Health of Nations"/></div><p>You can see the direct correlation between the wealth of a nation and its life expectancy. Furthermore, everyone's life expectancy goes up and all nations become bigger as time passes.</p><p>Another fun game I tried was pinpointing great events in history. Japan, for instance, does a full circle as her wealth and health had plummeted around 1945 but soon recovered.</p><p>You can find Mike Bostock's d3.js <a id="id355" class="indexterm"/>recreation of the visualization at <a class="ulink" href="http://bost.ocks.org/mike/nations/">http://bost.ocks.org/mike/nations/</a>.</p></div><div class="section" title="More great stuff"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl2sec34"/>More great stuff</h2></div></div></div><p>We could analyze many more examples together, but where's the fun in that? Find your own inspiration on the Internet. The d3.js examples gallery has many gems, such as the airport wind history visualization that uses circular histograms (<a class="ulink" href="http://windhistory.com/map.html#9.00/33.5876/-118.1257">http://windhistory.com/map.html#9.00/33.5876/-118.1257</a>) or drawing of koalas drawn by splitting circles in a fractal pattern: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.koalastothemax.com/">http://www.koalastothemax.com/</a>.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>The New York Times</em></span> listing, <span class="emphasis"><em>2012: The Year in Graphics</em></span>, is another great resource. The visualizations about the Olympics are my favorite. They are available at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/12/30/multimedia/2012-the-year-in-graphics.html">http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/12/30/multimedia/2012-the-year-in-graphics.html</a>.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>The Guardian</em></span> publishes a list of their visualizations together with the datasets. You can access it at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/data">http://www.guardian.co.uk/data</a>.</p></div></div></div>


  <div id="sbo-rt-content"><div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec29"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>We dipped our toes into the design side of things, looked at some great examples, and tried to learn how they work. As a non-designer, that's how I approach any new visualization I want to create—look at a bunch of examples and figure out what works on my dataset.</p><p>Then it's experimentation, experimentation, and playing around until I find something that works.</p><p>For a deeper look at designing visualizations, I suggest reading books devoted to the subject. <span class="emphasis"><em>Data Visualization: a successful design process</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Andy Kirk</em></span> and his blog <span class="emphasis"><em>Visualizing Data</em></span> are a good start. I haven't read the book, but the blog helped me a lot during this chapter.</p><p>Another good resource is <span class="emphasis"><em>Visualize This</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Nathan Yau</em></span>. The first few chapters are about design; the rest are about using R—a language for statistical analysis. It would also be good to read <span class="emphasis"><em>Interactive Data Visualization for the Web</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Scott Murray</em></span>.</p></div></div>
