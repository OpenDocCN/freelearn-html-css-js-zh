- en: Creating a navigation bar has been one of the most difficult tasks for a novice
    web designer or a web developer, with no experience in web designing. One has
    to take care of properly aligning links, overflows, styling links, making the
    whole bar responsive, and so on.

    diving deep into its CSS. Just like creating any other components in Bootstrap,
    creating a navigation bar also requires us to follow a proper markup structure.
    In this article, we will learn how to create a Bootstrap navigation bar, and how
    we can modify it to fit our needs. We will also check out various other ways of
    representing a navigation bar in a website. We will also integrate a fixed navigation
    bar in our current application, `OnlinePacktShopping`.

    static navigation bar. Create a folder called `BootstrapNavigation` and create
    an `index.html` file in it. We will use the same Bootstrap recommended HTML markup

    first class here, is used to apply proper styling and pull it to the right side
    of the navigation bar. The second class is used to keep a track of the state of
    the button from collapsed to noncollapsed. You should also add two custom-data
    attributes to this element: `data-toggle` and `data-target`. The first one is
    used to initiate the collapse functionality in Bootstrap''s JavaScript and the
    second attribute is used to identify the target menu to add the collapse functionality.
    The `data-target` attribute should contain the ID of the menu, which will be collapsing
    on smaller browsers. We will create this menu soon.'

    to it. Both these classes are for styling purposes.

    elements horizontally here. Bootstrap gives you a special form class for the navigation
    bar, `.navbar-form`. Adding this class properly styles the form, as per the navigation
    bar alignment.

    it responsive. We also saw how to change the look of the navigation bar by using
    the `.navbar-inverse` class. Finally, we went ahead and integrated this navigation
    bar into our application. I hope you had fun creating a responsive Bootstrap navigation
    bar.
