<div><h1 class="mainHeading" id="_idParaDest-4">Preface</h1>
<p class="normal">Clip Studio Paint was previously called <em class="italic">Manga Studio</em>, and is today used by more than 15 million artists around the world to create manga artwork. It is one of the most loved software among illustrators, manga artists, and comic writers due to its special features for drawing manga and comics. With just this software, a computer, and a graphics tablet, you can create black and white comics, fully colored comics, illustrations, and short animations.</p>
<p class="normal">This book is for Clip Studio Paint users at all levels, but I want you to be able to easily follow along as a beginner. To that end, I have tried to give tons of guidance and visual examples, and even a few beginner tips for drawing manga. I hope that, by the end of this book, you’ll be comfortable with Clip Studio Paint and be well on your way to being a manga art master!</p>
