			<p class="callout-heading">Overview</p>
			<p class="callout">By the end of this chapter, you will be able to operate a modern <strong class="bold">integrated development environment</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDE</strong>); identify and describe basic JavaScript structures; describe different JavaScript environments; recognize the major views and their uses within the popular web browser developer tools and construct HTML elements and modify their various attributes.</p>
			<p class="callout">In this chapter, you will get an overview of some popular tools for writing JavaScript and the various available runtimes for executing code with a modern web browser and beyond.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"/>Introduction</h1>
			<p>In the previous chapter, we explored a historical overview of JavaScript and examined the language's relationship with the Standard ECMAScript. We then explored JavaScript by accessing the developer tools of various browsers to provide a basic introduction to how JavaScript can be accessed.</p>
			<p>Now that we are familiar with JavaScript in a more cerebral way, it's time for some hands-on work with the language. First, we'll provide an overview of some popular tools for writing JavaScript and of the various runtimes available for executing code. With those installed, we can begin writing some JavaScript in order to gain some familiarity with the language's syntax and structure—how to write code in a meaningful way and how to include it in a web environment.</p>
			<p>Within this chapter, we will pay particular attention to the primary target for most JavaScript environments and a great tool in itself—the modern web browser. In the previous chapter, we looked at an overview of how to access developer tools in various web browsers. In this chapter, we will further explore how these tools can be used in JavaScript development.</p>
			<p>Finally, we'll dig more deeply into web browser interactions and look at how we can control both the style and content of elements within the web browser with the use of common JavaScript functions. All the code in this chapter will be written using the editor that we are about to introduce.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/>Integrated Development Environments (IDE)</h1>
			<p>JavaScript is a language that is interpreted at runtime as there is no need for us to compile it beforehand. There are other ways of writing JavaScript in a non-direct way, such as through transpilation or compilation, but we'll review those later. Before we get too far into working with JavaScript and writing code, we should examine the benefits of using a dedicated development environment to write and manage our JavaScript code.</p>
			<p>Using an IDE aligned with the platform and languages you work with provides a number of benefits over a simple text editor. For example, IDEs usually include the following features:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Linting, formatting, and other cleanup utilities</li>
				<li>Integrated <strong class="bold">Terminal</strong> and command-line access</li>
				<li>Programming language <strong class="bold">debugging tools</strong></li>
				<li>Robust code completion and hinting as you type</li>
				<li>Snippets and preformed code content</li>
				<li>Built-in compilers (depending on the language and platform)</li>
				<li>Potential <strong class="bold">emulation features</strong>—especially when dealing with mobile development</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>GitHub's Atom</h2>
			<p>A free and open-source editor, Atom is maintained by GitHub and is available for Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, and various Linux distributions. Since this editor was created by GitHub, one of its main features is tight integration along with the other services they provide within the editor:</p>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.1: GitHub for Atom</p>
			<p>The editor features a plugin system that allows users to add support for various languages and themes. Atom can be downloaded and installed for free from https://atom.io/.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor051"/>Sublime Text</h2>
			<p>Though a very popular editor some years back, it's still worth noting here as many developers use this IDE for JavaScript and more. Sublime Text supports Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, and various Linux distributions. The latest version was released in 2019:</p>

			<p>Sublime Text can be downloaded and installed from <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">https://www.sublimetext.com/</a> as a free evaluation tool; however, it requires you to  purchase it for long-time use.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/>Adobe Dreamweaver</h2>
			<p>Previously the property of Macromedia, Adobe acquired that company and ceased the development of their existing web editing product, Adobe GoLive, and instead strengthened the support for Dreamweaver. In the years since then, the application has gone through several rewrites and adjustments, but the focus has always been split between a visual editing view and one targeted at developers in the form of bare code. The code editor within Dreamweaver is based on Adobe's open-source Brackets (<a href="https://packt.live/2WWMUH6">https://packt.live/2WWMUH6</a>) project:</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor053"/>JetBrains WebStorm</h2>
			<p>A variety of editors and other tools are available from JetBrains. Many of these build upon one another in terms of complexity and functionality. When looking primarily for a web editor for authoring JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, JetBrains WebStorm is a good choice, but it does have a bit of a learning curve in the way that it handles the management of projects and associated files:</p>
			<div>

Those affiliated with educational institutions can apply for a free license with yearly renewal.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"/>Microsoft Visual Studio Code</h2>
			<p>For this module, we'll be using the Visual Studio Code as our IDE. This software application is a free, cross-platform IDE from Microsoft that is updated every month. It allows you to work with native web technologies in a very capable way—but also has the ability to support other languages and features through extensions. Visual Studio Code is very popular with developers of all sorts:</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor055"/>JavaScript Project and File Management</h1>
			<p>Now that we have our development environment installed, we need to consider some best practices in terms of where we should store projects on our local machine, and how we should organize folders and files within each project. We'll also walk through a small exercise that will demonstrate how to load a project (including all associated files) into Visual Studio Code.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/>Project Folders and Files</h2>
			<p>It is advisable to set aside a directory on your local machine where you will place all the projects that you may be working on. For instance, you could create a directory called <strong class="source-inline">Projects</strong> on your local disk and then create specific project folders within it—one for each distinct project. This way, you can be sure of where all your projects are located. You can even create a shortcut to your <strong class="source-inline">Projects</strong> folder to get at it easily whenever you like:</p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer041">
					<img alt="Figure 2.6: Example of a Projects directory on macOS&#13;&#10;" src="image/C14377_02_06.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.6: Example of a Projects directory on macOS</p>
			<p>Individual projects will exist in specific folders within your main <strong class="source-inline">Projects</strong> directory. Depending on how many projects you work on, you may have to create many subfolders. Each project should be clearly named for ease of identification.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"/>Exercise 2.01: Creating a Working Project Directory</h2>
			<p>Let's look at how to create a directory so that we can contain our working project and all its associated files and subfolders:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In your <strong class="source-inline">filesystem</strong>, locate a place that is easily accessible and to which your account has full read/write rights, as you'll be writing files at this location. If you already have a preexisting <strong class="source-inline">Projects</strong> directory, this is likely to be an ideal location.</li>
				<li>Within this folder, create a new folder and name it <strong class="source-inline">JavaScript</strong>, or another name of your choice, like so:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer042"><img alt="Figure 2.7: Creating a new folder on macOS&#13;&#10;" src="image/C14377_02_07.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.7: Creating a new folder on macOS</p></li>
				<li>With your new project folder created, navigate to its parent directory. You may be there already or may need to go up one level in the <strong class="source-inline">filesystem</strong>. This all depends on your operating system and how you've created the folder.</li>
				<li>Using your mouse, stylus, or touchpad, drag the working project folder from the file explorer into the Visual Studio Code application window:<p> </p><div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer043"><img alt="Figure 2.8: Loading the project into Visual Studio Code&#13;&#10;" src="image/C14377_02_08.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.8: Loading the project into Visual Studio Code</p></li>
				<li>The current tab's content within Visual Studio Code will become obscured, indicating that you can release the folder onto it. Go ahead and do this.</li>
				<li>This will effectively set the folder you dragged onto the Visual Studio Code interface as your working project folder. Look to the left-hand pane and navigate the files and folders in it:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer044"><img alt="Figure 2.9: The declared working project folder&#13;&#10;" src="image/C14377_02_09.jpg"/></div></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.9: The declared working project folder</p>
			<p>The newly created folder is now the working project folder within Visual Studio Code. Normally, you'd see a list of files and folders in the leftmost sidebar. We haven't created any files or folders yet, so there is nothing there.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">You can also declare the working project folder by choosing <strong class="bold">File</strong> | <strong class="bold">Open</strong> from the application menu and browsing for the folder.</p>
			<p>Visual Studio Code, like many other editors, will remember projects you've opened within it and present a list of them when you next open the application.</p>
			<p>In this section, you learned about the importance of having an organized folder structure on your local machine for managing all your projects. We also saw how to create a new working folder for a project and then opened it within our code editor.</p>
			<p>In the next section, we'll use the project we just created to start writing and examining JavaScript syntax and common structural elements.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>JavaScript Syntax and Structure</h1>
			<p>Now that we've installed an IDE and established how to manage a working project folder within our code editor, it's time to look at how JavaScript code is written and ordered within such an environment. The first thing we need to do is create a set of files within the <strong class="source-inline">Project</strong> folder because we will write our JavaScript instructions in these. We will create a set of files within the working project folder and then bind them to one another.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>Exercise 2.02: Creating Project Boilerplate</h2>
			<p>The most common environment where JavaScript runs is inside a web browser. For JavaScript to run within this environment, it must be included within a host HTML file in some way. Let's create a basic HTML file and a JavaScript file and instruct the web browser to load our JavaScript file within the HTML at runtime. Let's get started:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the working project folder you created previously within your IDE (Visual Studio Code). No files will be listed in the leftmost pane since we haven't created any yet:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer045"><img alt="Figure 2.10: The current project contains no files&#13;&#10;" src="image/C14377_02_10.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.10: The current project contains no files</p></li>
				<li>If you hover your mouse cursor over this leftmost area, you will notice a number of icons appear to the right of the project name. The leftmost of these icons allows for the creation of new files. The one next to it allows the creation of new folders. Click the <strong class="bold">New File</strong> icon:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer046"><img alt="Figure 2.11: Clicking the New File icon&#13;&#10;" src="image/C14377_02_11.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.11: Clicking the New File icon</p><p>A new file is immediately created and is available for us to name. You should immediately provide a name and file extension. The name should be something that tells you why the file exists, and the extension lets Visual Studio Code and other applications and services understand how to manage and run the file. Type in <strong class="source-inline">index.html</strong> for the name of the extension of the newly created file. The name <strong class="source-inline">index</strong> tells us that this file is the <em class="italic">root</em> or <em class="italic">index</em> HTML file for our project. The <strong class="source-inline">.html</strong> extension informs both us and the computer as to the nature of this file:</p><div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer047"><img alt="Figure 2.12: Naming the file index.html&#13;&#10;" src="image/C14377_02_12.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.12: Naming the file index.html</p></li>
				<li>Once complete, hit <em class="italic">Enter</em>/<em class="italic">Return</em> on your keyboard to commit the change. The file will immediately open in the editing pane of your editor. As you can see, it is completely blank:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer048"><img alt="Figure 2.13: The file exists and is open, but it is empty&#13;&#10;" src="image/C14377_02_13.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.13: The file exists and is open, but it is empty</p></li>
				<li>Type in the following boilerplate HTML code to set up the file's structure:<p class="source-code">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</p><p class="source-code">&lt;html lang="en"&gt;</p><p class="source-code">  &lt;head&gt;</p><p class="source-code">    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</p><p class="source-code">    &lt;title&gt;JavaScript Project&lt;/title&gt;</p><p class="source-code">  &lt;/head&gt;</p><p class="source-code">  &lt;body&gt;</p><p class="source-code">    &lt;h1&gt;Just an HTML page...&lt;/h1&gt;</p><p class="source-code">  &lt;/body&gt;</p><p class="source-code">&lt;/html&gt;</p></li>
				<li>We declare the file as HTML and establish a <strong class="source-inline">&lt;head&gt;</strong> tag and a <strong class="source-inline">&lt;body&gt;</strong> tag. The head of an HTML document includes invisible data such as declaring the character set and title. The body of an HTML document contains visible elements such as text and images. Notice that you must save the file using <strong class="bold">File</strong> | <strong class="bold">Save</strong> or by using <em class="italic">Command</em>/<em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">S</em>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer049"><img alt="Figure 2.14: Our initial HTML markup structure&#13;&#10;" src="image/C14377_02_14.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.14: Our initial HTML markup structure</p></li>
				<li>Create a new file once again, this time naming it <strong class="source-inline">app.js</strong>. This will signify that this is the main JavaScript file for the application. The <strong class="source-inline">.js</strong> file extension indicates an external JavaScript file.</li>
				<li>The new JavaScript file will open just like the HTML file did. As you can see, it is also initially empty. Type in the following JavaScript code:<p class="source-code">console.log("app.js JavaScript Included!");</p></li>
				<li>Ensure that you save the JavaScript file again by navigating to <strong class="source-inline">File</strong> | <strong class="source-inline">Save</strong> from the application menu or by using the keyboard shortcut <strong class="source-inline">Command</strong>/<strong class="source-inline">Ctrl</strong> + <strong class="source-inline">S</strong>:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer050"><img alt="Figure 2.15: You should now have both a JavaScript file and an HTML file&#13;&#10;" src="image/C14377_02_15.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.15: You should now have both a JavaScript file and an HTML file</p></li>
				<li>In order to bind the newly created JavaScript file to our HTML so that it can run in the web browser, we must reference it within the HTML file itself. Switch to the HTML file titled <strong class="bold">index.html</strong> from earlier. Place the following code directly following the <strong class="source-inline">&lt;title&gt;</strong> tag and before the closing tag of the <strong class="source-inline">&lt;head&gt;</strong> element:<p class="source-code">&lt;script src="app.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p></li>
				<li>The <strong class="source-inline">&lt;script&gt;</strong> tag is used to either include an external <strong class="source-inline">.js</strong> file, as we are doing here, or it can be used to denote a block of JavaScript code directly within HTML. The full HTML file code should now appear as follows:<p class="source-code">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</p><p class="source-code">&lt;html lang="en"&gt;</p><p class="source-code">  &lt;head&gt;</p><p class="source-code">    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</p><p class="source-code">    &lt;title&gt;JavaScript Project&lt;/title&gt;</p><p class="source-code">    &lt;script src="app.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p><p class="source-code">  &lt;/head&gt;</p><p class="source-code">  &lt;body&gt;</p><p class="source-code">    &lt;h1&gt;Just an HTML page...&lt;/h1&gt;</p><p class="source-code">  &lt;/body&gt;</p><p class="source-code">&lt;/html&gt;</p></li>
				<li>With the new line of code added to the HTML, save the file once again. In Visual Studio Code, a file with unsaved changes is signified with a small, filled disc in the <strong class="source-inline">File</strong> tab within the project explorer:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer051"><img alt="Figure 2.16: A file with unsaved changes&#13;&#10;" src="image/C14377_02_16.jpg"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.16: A file with unsaved changes</p></li>
				<li>Run the <strong class="source-inline">index.html</strong> file within a web browser. Open <strong class="bold">developer tools</strong> and activate the <strong class="bold">Console</strong> view. If all goes well, you will see the message we instructed JavaScript to output:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer052"><img alt="Figure 2.17: The resulting console output&#13;&#10;" src="image/C14377_02_17.jpg"/></div></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.17: The resulting console output</p>
			<p>We now know that our project boilerplate has been configured correctly since the HTML is running and has effectively called code from within the JavaScript file. We now have the beginnings of a web application—complete with structure (HTML) and logic (JavaScript) components.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/>Basic JavaScript Syntax</h2>
			<p>It is important to know the basic syntax of any programming language in order to write it correctly. To begin writing JavaScript, you'll need to know how to declare variables, assign data to variables, and terminate commands properly.</p>
			<p>A variable in JavaScript is an <strong class="bold">identifier</strong> whose value can be retrieved or set and is normally defined with the <strong class="source-inline">var</strong> keyword. Here is an example of a variable declaration:</p>
			<p class="source-code">var myName;</p>
			<p>To actually assign a value to this variable and give it something useful to do, we must use the assignment operator, <strong class="source-inline">=</strong>. Here is the same statement with a value assigned to the variable:</p>
			<p class="source-code">var myName = "Joseph";</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">In this instance, we are assigning a string value to the variable. There are many different <em class="italic">types</em> of values, or data, that we can assign to variables, and we'll learn more about these in the next chapter.</p>
			<p>You will note that we also place a <strong class="bold">semicolon</strong> after each variable declaration, whether we assign a value to it or not. While it is not absolutely necessary to do this, the use of a semicolon in this manner terminates a command. Multiple commands should, however, be placed across multiple lines, as demonstrated here:</p>
			<p class="source-code">var firstName = "Joseph";</p>
			<p class="source-code">var lastName = "Labrecque";</p>
			<p class="source-code">console.log("Hello, " + firstName + " " + lastName);</p>
			<p>We assign string values to both a <strong class="source-inline">firstName</strong> and <strong class="source-inline">lastName</strong> variable, and then employ the <strong class="source-inline">console.log()</strong> method along with some string concatenation using the <strong class="source-inline">+</strong> operator to form a message and output it to the browser console. When executed in the browser, it appears like this:</p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer053">
					<img alt="Figure 2.18: The resulting output message&#13;&#10;" src="image/C14377_02_18.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.18: The resulting output message</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">The term <strong class="bold">concatenation</strong> simply refers to joining plain strings and string variable values together, as we've done here.</p>
			<p>That's about all you need to know regarding syntax to get started. Don't worry—there will be much more information around syntax when you reach <em class="italic">Chapter 5</em>, <em class="italic">Beyond the Fundamentals</em>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor061"/>JavaScript Execution Order</h2>
			<p>This section hearkens back to an example from the previous chapter in terms of the various ways JavaScript can be included within a web document. There are two choices here: either include an external JavaScript file somewhere within the <strong class="source-inline">&lt;head&gt;</strong> tag or the <strong class="source-inline">&lt;body&gt;</strong> tag of your HTML document or embed the code directly within the document itself, again at either location.</p>
			<p>No matter how you include JavaScript within your HTML document, the web browser will always execute from top to bottom. Any JavaScript within the <strong class="source-inline">&lt;head&gt;</strong> tag of a document will execute before anything within the <strong class="source-inline">&lt;body&gt;</strong> tag of the document. Of course, you can compartmentalize blocks of JavaScript code within functions to execute when invoked as well, which effectively gets around this rule in some ways.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-62"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>Exercise 2.03: Verifying an Execution Order </h2>
			<p>Let's conduct a small exercise to see whether, for any JavaScript, the <strong class="source-inline">&lt;head&gt;</strong> of a document will execute before anything with the <strong class="source-inline">&lt;body&gt;</strong> tag of the document. Let's get started:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In the exercise files for this chapter, you will find a document named <strong class="source-inline">order.html</strong>. Open this within Visual Studio Code to inspect it. You will see the following HTML code:<p class="source-code">&lt;!doctype html&gt;</p><p class="source-code">&lt;html lang="en"&gt;</p><p class="source-code">&lt;head&gt;</p><p class="source-code">    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</p><p class="source-code">    &lt;title&gt;JavaScript Execution Order&lt;/title&gt;</p><p class="source-code">&lt;/head&gt;</p><p class="source-code">&lt;body&gt;</p><p class="source-code">    &lt;h1&gt;JavaScript Execution Order&lt;/h1&gt;</p><p class="source-code">    &lt;p&gt;View the browser console to see the effective order of execution.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p class="source-code">&lt;/body&gt;</p><p class="source-code">&lt;/html&gt;</p></li>
				<li>You'll notice there is no JavaScript just yet, so let's insert some bits of code in various places for this demonstration. Add the following code beneath the <strong class="source-inline">&lt;title&gt;</strong> element within the document's <strong class="source-inline">&lt;head&gt; </strong>tag:<p class="source-code">&lt;script&gt;console.log('Within the HEAD');&lt;/script&gt;</p></li>
				<li>Now, add this snippet directly above the <strong class="source-inline">&lt;h1&gt;</strong> element within the <strong class="source-inline">&lt;body&gt;</strong> tag of our document:<p class="source-code">&lt;script&gt;console.log('Within the BODY');&lt;/script&gt;</p></li>
				<li>Finally, we'll add another line of code just before the <strong class="source-inline">&lt;body&gt;</strong>  tag closes:<p class="source-code">&lt;script&gt;console.log('At the very END');&lt;/script&gt;</p><p>The document should now appear as follows:</p><p class="source-code">&lt;!doctype html&gt;</p><p class="source-code">&lt;html lang="en"&gt;</p><p class="source-code">&lt;head&gt;</p><p class="source-code">    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</p><p class="source-code">    &lt;title&gt;JavaScript Execution Order&lt;/title&gt;</p><p class="source-code">    &lt;script&gt;console.log('Within the HEAD');&lt;/script&gt;</p><p class="source-code">&lt;/head&gt;</p><p class="source-code">&lt;body&gt;</p><p class="source-code">    &lt;script&gt;console.log('Within the BODY');&lt;/script&gt;</p><p class="source-code">    &lt;h1&gt;JavaScript Execution Order&lt;/h1&gt;</p><p class="source-code">    &lt;p&gt;View the browser console to see the effective order of execution.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p class="source-code">    &lt;script&gt;console.log('At the very END');&lt;/script&gt;</p><p class="source-code">&lt;/body&gt;</p><p class="source-code">&lt;/html&gt;</p></li>
				<li>Run this document within your web browser with the developer tools Console view open. You will be able to verify that yes—the code is certainly processed from top to bottom, as we explained:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer054"><img alt="Figure 2.19: Verification of the execution order&#13;&#10;" src="image/C14377_02_19.jpg"/></div></li>
			</ol>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.19: Verification of the execution order</p>
			<p>The <strong class="source-inline">console.log()</strong> command in JavaScript will write any data within parentheses to the console. This is the simplest way of debugging JavaScript, though this will be explored further in the next chapter.</p>
			<p>In this section, we've learned about several important fundamentals regarding the structure and syntax of JavaScript—particularly when it comes to the web browser environment.</p>
			<p>In the next section, we'll explore other environments in which JavaScript can run.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-63"><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>Overview of JavaScript Environments</h1>
			<p>So far in our journey, we've only been exposed to the modern web browser as a JavaScript runtime, but even within browsers, there are a variety of JavaScript engines that serve as different runtimes for JavaScript. For instance, Chrome has the <strong class="bold">V8 engine</strong>, while Firefox runs JavaScript through <strong class="bold">SpiderMonkey</strong>. Just about every browser has its own distinct engine.</p>
			<p>There are also other runtimes aside from those that are browser-based. We'll have a look at the variety of runtimes available to us now.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>Browser-Based JavaScript</h2>
			<p>By far, the most common environment for using JavaScript throughout its entire history as a language is within the web browser. We've already spoken of this particular runtime quite a lot, so we will not spend time going over all of this again:</p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer055">
					<img alt="Figure 2.20: V8—JavaScript in the web browser&#13;&#10;" src="image/C14377_02_20.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.20: V8—JavaScript in the web browser</p>
			<p>Some of the benefits of using the web browser as a JavaScript runtime are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Web browsers are one of the most distributed software platforms in the world.</li>
				<li>Browsers include a set of built-in developer tools for debugging and monitoring JavaScript.</li>
				<li>Browsers are the absolute primary runtime for JavaScript and all others follow it.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can learn more about each browser runtime at their respective websites. To learn more about V8, the runtime engine powering Chrome, visit <a href="https://v8.dev/">https://v8.dev/</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-65"><a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>Server-Based JavaScript</h2>
			<p>With the improvement in the performance of JavaScript engines in the web browser, people began wondering whether there may be other applications for the language and specific runtimes—particularly in terms of a server-based environment. In 2009, this became a reality with the creation of <strong class="bold">Node.js</strong>. A year before this, Google had open-sourced its powerful V8 JavaScript engine. This allowed developers to implement V8, along with specific operating system bindings, to produce the first version of Node.js:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.21: Node.js—JavaScript on the server</p>
			<p>The benefits of using a server-based JavaScript runtime include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Threadless execution of code.</li>
				<li>Events are completely non-blocking.</li>
				<li>Efficiency and performance are separated from the client.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can learn more about Node.js at <a href="https://nodejs.org/">https://nodejs.org/</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-66"><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>Desktop JavaScript</h2>
			<p>While not exactly a new environment for JavaScript to run with, desktop applications are a segment that ripe for growth as additional runtimes and libraries mature. The most popular solution for building desktop applications is Electron. Like similar frameworks, when developing applications for Electron, you will be using native web technologies that end up being wrapped in a native-focused container for any target desktop operating system. </p>
			<p>Electron apps can target Apple macOS, Microsoft Windows, or Linux, and are all built-in JavaScript:</p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer057">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.22: Electron—JavaScript on the desktop</p>
			<p>The benefits of using a desktop-focused JavaScript runtime include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The ability to use native web technologies to write desktop applications.</li>
				<li>Most functionality is platform-agnostic, so, often, no specific operating system commands are needed.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can learn more about Electron at <a href="https://electronjs.org/">https://electronjs.org/</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-67"><a id="_idTextAnchor067"/>Mobile JavaScript</h2>
			<p>Mobile devices have been huge since iPhone and Android first made their debuts nearly a decade ago. Of course, developers want to tap into this segment of the market and, thankfully, there have been a lot of pretty good solutions over the years that make use of JavaScript. For quite some time, Apache Cordova and Adobe PhoneGap were the primary frameworks that were used to translate web technologies into functional mobile applications. More recently, technologies such as <strong class="bold">Ionic</strong> have become incredibly popular for those using common JavaScript-based frameworks such as Angular, React, and Vue. With many of these tools, you can also use plain vanilla JavaScript as well:</p>

				<li>Most functionality is platform-agnostic, so, often, no specific mobile operating system commands are needed.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>So far, we've had a brief overview of the various primary runtime environments for modern JavaScript.</p>
			<p>In the next section, we'll focus once more on the web browsers that we introduced in the first chapter while paying more attention to the specific functions of some of the more useful views within their tools.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-68"><a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>A Closer Look at Web Browser Developer Tools</h1>
			<p>In the previous chapter, we had a brief introduction to working with browser developer tools. We'll expand on our exploration of browser developer tools and examine a sample of the most used views when it comes to working with JavaScript in the web browser.</p>
			<p>Of course, there are many other views and options than what will be mentioned here and, while we are examining these from within Google Chrome, they will differ in both overall look and functional use from browser to browser. This should give you a good idea of what is possible, though, no matter what your preferred browser is.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">To access Developer Tools in Google Chrome, press the <strong class="source-inline">F12</strong> key.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-69"><a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>The Elements View</h2>
			<p>The primary view that you'll be presented with when exploring browser developer tools for the first time will most likely be the Elements view. This view is super useful as it presents all the elements of a web document and the associated content and attributes in a very structured way. You will also notice that the various styles and event listeners will be available for you to explore within this view. Selecting an element will display both the CSS rules and any associated event listeners:</p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer059">
					<img alt="Figure 2.24: Web document Elements view&#13;&#10;" src="image/C14377_02_24.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.24: Web document Elements view</p>
			<p>While you may think that there is no useful content being displayed in this view in terms of JavaScript, you actually have access to the entire <strong class="bold">DOM</strong> structure here and can monitor this structure and the associated attributes to verify and explore changes you are making via code.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-70"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>The Console View</h2>
			<p>This is the developer tools view that we've had the most interaction with thus far and is likely to be the most important view when writing and testing JavaScript code. Any errors and warnings will be displayed within this view and you can also get the output on whatever data you wish as your code executes within the document. Using a JavaScript method such as <strong class="source-inline">console.log()</strong> will display output of all sorts of useful data for you to explore within the Console view, and you can even customize exactly the sort of data that is shown through various options associated with the view itself:</p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer060">
					<img alt="Figure 2.25: Browser console output&#13;&#10;" src="image/C14377_02_25.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.25: Browser console output</p>
			<p>Every web browser has a Console view and even though specific use of this view may differ between browsers, the fundamental usage remains the same.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-71"><a id="_idTextAnchor071"/>The Sources View</h2>
			<p>When it comes to any sort of programming, the ability to set breakpoints to effectively pause code execution and debug your program at a certain state is critical. Using the source view, we can do this effectively, right within the web browser itself.</p>
			<p>This view provides a way for us to choose to view the source code for any HTML or JavaScript files that are currently running and set breakpoints at specific lines in order to cause the runtime to pause when the breakpoint is encountered. Once paused, we can then use additional tools within the source's view to examine our code in certain ways:</p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer061">
					<img alt="Figure 2.26: Debugging JavaScript in the web browser&#13;&#10;" src="image/C14377_02_26.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.26: Debugging JavaScript in the web browser</p>
			<p>In the preceding screenshot, we have set a breakpoint at line 39 of our HTML file, which includes embedded JavaScript code. With the code execution paused at this specific line, we can examine the state of our program in a very detailed way.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-72"><a id="_idTextAnchor072"/>The Network View</h2>
			<p>The final developer tools view that we'll look at before moving on is the Network view. This allows you to keep tabs on everything being transferred as part of your application. HTML documents, JavaScript files, CSS files, and even invisible content such as <strong class="bold">XMLHttpRequests (XHR)</strong> and other behind the scenes data transmissions are all logged and measured here for you to inspect. If you want to see a specific type of network activity and hide all the others, there is even a handy filter along the top:</p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer062">
					<img alt="Figure 2.27: Viewing network activity in the web browser&#13;&#10;" src="image/C14377_02_27.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.27: Viewing network activity in the web browser</p>
			<p>One of the important aspects of the <strong class="bold">Network</strong> view that you'll want to note is that <strong class="bold">Disable cache</strong> is a tool option. Disabling the browser cache is an especially good idea if you are making many changes to externally loaded <strong class="bold">.js</strong> files while testing your program as it will prevent these files from being cached by the browser while testing.</p>
			<p>In this section, we spent some more time getting familiar with some of the helpful views within web browser developer tools.</p>
			<p>In the next section, we'll look at a hands-on activity that allows for the direct manipulation of HTML elements and their attributes through JavaScript code.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-73"><a id="_idTextAnchor073"/>HTML Element Manipulation with JavaScript</h1>
			<p>We have alluded to the abil<a id="_idTextAnchor074"/>ity of JavaScript to directly manipulate elements within an HTML document a number of times. We'll now go ahead and see firsthand exactly how the language can be leveraged to perform this sort of manipulation. </p>
			<p>Before moving on to the activity, there are a couple of concepts to understand so that you know how HTML elements function. As you've seen through example, elements in HTML generally consist of an opening and closing tag, within which there is often text data. If you think of a <strong class="source-inline">&lt;p&gt;</strong>  tag or paragraph element in HTML, the text within that element, between the opening and closing tags, is the text displayed to the user.</p>
			<p>If we need to address a specific HTML element to manipulate, the best way to do so is with the <strong class="source-inline">getElementById()</strong> JavaScript method. Of course, the element in question must contain an ID attribute for this to function as expected.</p>
			<p>For example, maybe we have a simple HTML unordered list that contains a set of three list items:</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;ul id="frameworks"&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">    &lt;li&gt;Angular&lt;/li&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">    &lt;li&gt;Vue&lt;/li&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">    &lt;li&gt;React&lt;/li&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">&lt;/ul&gt;</p>
			<p>What if we wanted to manipulate this list through code? We can do so with some simple JavaScript. First, we have to store a reference to our list itself. Since the list element has an <strong class="source-inline">id</strong> attribute with a value of <strong class="source-inline">frameworks</strong>, we can store a reference to this element using the following code: </p>
			<p class="source-code">var frameworksList = document.getElementById('frameworks');</p>
			<p>With a reference created, we can now easily create and add a new child element: </p>
			<p class="source-code">var newFramework = document.createElement('li');</p>
			<p class="source-code">newFramework.innerText = "Apache Royale";</p>
			<p class="source-code">frameworksList.appendChild(newFramework);</p>
			<p>We can even adjust the style properties of our newly added element: </p>
			<p class="source-code">frameworksList.lastChild.style.color = "crimson";</p>
			<p><strong class="source-inline">getElementById()</strong> is a JavaScript function that returns an element that has been granted a certain ID attribute and is an exact match for the specific string. An HTML element ID attribute must be unique.</p>
			<p>Once we have a reference to any element in JavaScript through the use of <strong class="source-inline">getElementById()</strong>, we can then get a reference to its child elements through the <strong class="source-inline">children.length</strong> child attribute and finally get a count of how many child elements exist by invoking the length property.</p>
			<p>Additionally, any attributes that are defined as part of these elements can also be manipulated with JavaScript code. In this activity, we'll make adjustments to the <strong class="source-inline">style</strong> attribute—effectively modifying the visual appearance of the specific element content.</p>
			<p>In this section, we've seen how to directly manipulate HTML elements and associated attributes using pure JavaScript code. You should now have a good idea of what this language is capable of.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-74">Activity 2.01: Adding and M<a id="_idTextAnchor075"/>odifying an Ite<a id="_idTextAnchor076"/>m to/in the To-Do List</h2>
			<p>In this activity, we will b<a id="_idTextAnchor077"/>e examining the beginnings of a small web-based view that is meant to list a set of to-do items. You need to create some boilerplate for the following code, which is currently static HTML and CSS with a placeholder <strong class="source-inline">&lt;script&gt;</strong> tag. You then need to add an item, <strong class="source-inline">Research Wines</strong>, to the to-do list and change the font color of the newly added item to crimson. Lastly, you need to verify the order that this code will be executed in.</p>
			<p>This activity will help cement the relationship that exists between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The following code shows how JavaScript can impact the visual display styles and even the elemental content of HTML nodes:</p>
			<p class="source-code-heading">activity.html</p>
			<p class="source-code">1 &lt;!doctype h<a id="_idTextAnchor078"/>tml&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">2 &lt;html l<a id="_idTextAnchor079"/>ang="en"&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">3 &lt;head&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">4     &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">5     &lt;title&gt;To-Do List&lt;/title&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">6     &lt;link href=https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Architects+Daughter|Bowlby+One+SC  rel="stylesheet"&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">7     &lt;style&gt;</p>
			<p class="source-code">8         body {</p>
			<p class="source-code">9             background-color:rgb(37, 37, 37);</p>
			<p class="source-code">10             color:aliceblue;</p>
			<p class="source-code">11             padding:2rem;</p>
			<p class="source-code">12             margin:0;</p>
			<p class="source-code">13             font-family: 'Architects Daughter', cursive;</p>
			<p class="source-code">14             font-size: 12px;</p>
			<p class="source-code">15         } </p>
			<p class="source-code-link">The full code is available at: <a href="https://packt.live/2Xc9Y4o">https://packt.live/2Xc9Y4o</a></p>
			<p>The steps for this activity are as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">You will create the HTML fi<a id="_idTextAnchor080"/>le yourself and paste in the preceding boilerplate HTML code to get started. This file conforms to a standard HTML document targeting the HTML5 specification. It is structured with a <strong class="source-inline">&lt;head&gt;</strong> tag and a <strong class="source-inline">&lt;body&gt;</strong> tag, and nested within the <strong class="source-inline">&lt;body&gt;</strong> tag exists the visual elements and the data a user would be able to see within their web browser. Additionally, within this file, you will see a set of CSS style rules within the <strong class="source-inline">&lt;style&gt;</strong> tags, which provide visual HTML elements with some additional specific colors, fonts, and sizes. The CSS refers to additional stylistic font information being loaded from remote Google Fonts (<a href="https://fonts.google.com/">https://fonts.google.com/</a>) services.</li>
				<li>Assign an ID to our list in order to identify it via code.</li>
				<li>Create a new variable and use the ID to address this element directly by the use of the <strong class="source-inline">getElementById()</strong> method.</li>
				<li>Create a new HTML list item element.</li>
				<li>Populate the list item with a data value.</li>
				<li>Add it to the visual document by appending it to a chosen parent container that already exists.</li>
				<li>Change the color of the existing element.</li>
				<li>Verify the execution order of our commands by counting the initial number of list items.</li>
				<li>Then, count the final number of list items after code execution.</li>
				<li>Refresh the browser view and watch the console.<p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">The solution to this activity can be found on page 712.</p></li>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-75"><a id="_idTextAnchor081"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we<a id="_idTextAnchor082"/> had a look at different popular IDEs for writing and maintaining JavaScript code and chose Visual Studio Code as our primary editor for this portion of this book. We then used this editor to examine JavaScript file structures, syntax, and project management tasks. Following that, we had a brief overview of different JavaScript runtime environments—from the browser to the desktop, remote servers, and mobile devices. Finally, we had a better look at the various web browser developer tools available to us and performed an activity that allowed for the manipulation of HTML elements and their various attributes.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will explore fundamental concepts and structures that are involved when we're working in JavaScript, cover the basics from object types to conditionals and looping structures, how to go about writing and invoking functions, and even commenting out and debugging code.</p>
