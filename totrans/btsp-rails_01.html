In this mobile-first generation, we are forced to go with the wind and make our application compatible with Mobiles, Tables, PCs, and every possible display on Earth.</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Bootstrap</strong></span> is the one stop<a id="id0" class="indexterm"/> solution for all woes that developers have been facing. It creates beautiful responsive designs without any extra efforts and without any advanced CSS knowledge. It is a true boon for every developer.</p><p>In this chapter, and throughout the book, we will be focusing on how to beautify our Rails applications through the help of Bootstrap. In this chapter, we will create a basic Todo application with Rails. We will explore the folder structure of a Rails application and analyze which folders are important for templating a Rails Application. This will be helpful if you want to quickly revisit Rails concepts.</p><p>We will also see how to create views, link them, and also style them. The styling in this chapter will be done traditionally through the application's default CSS files. Finally, we will discuss how we can speed up the designing process using Bootstrap.</p><p>In short, we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Why Bootstrap with Rails?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Setting up a Todo Application in Rails</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Analyzing folder structure of a Rails application</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Creating views</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Styling views using CSS</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Challenges in traditionally styling a Rails Application</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Why Bootstrap with Rails?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec08"/>Why Bootstrap with Rails?</h1></div></div></div><p>Rails is one<a id="id1" class="indexterm"/> the most popular Ruby frameworks which is currently at its peak, both in terms of demand and technology trend. With more than 3,100 members contributing to its development, and tens of thousands of applications already built using it, Rails has created a standard for every other framework in the Web today.</p><p>Rails was<a id="id2" class="indexterm"/> initially developed by David Heinemeier Hansson in 2003 to ease his own development process in Ruby. Later, he became generous enough to release Rails to the open source community. Today, it is popularly known as<a id="id3" class="indexterm"/> <span class="strong"><strong>Ruby on Rails</strong></span>.</p><p>Rails shortens the development life cycle by moving the focus from reinventing the wheel to innovating new features. It is based on the convention of the configurations principle, which means that if you follow the Rails conventions, you would end up writing much less code than you would otherwise write.</p><p>Bootstrap, on<a id="id4" class="indexterm"/> the other hand, is one of the most popular frontend development frameworks. It was initially developed at Twitter for some of its internal projects. It makes the life of a novice web developer easier by providing most of the reusable components that are already built and are ready to use. Bootstrap can be easily integrated with a Rails development environment through various methods. We can directly use the <code class="literal">.css</code> files provided by the framework, or can extend it through its Sass version and let Rails compile it.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note02"/>Note</h3><p>Sass is a CSS<a id="id5" class="indexterm"/> preprocessor that brings logic and functionality into CSS. It includes features like variables, functions, mixins, and others. Using the Sass version of Bootstrap is a recommended method in Rails. It gives various options to customize Bootstrap's default styles easily.</p></div></div><p>Bootstrap also provides <a id="id6" class="indexterm"/>various JavaScript components that can be used by those who don't have any real JavaScript knowledge. These components are required in almost every modern website being built today.</p><p>Bootstrap with Rails is a deadly combination. You can build applications faster and invest more time to think about functionality, rather than rewrite codes.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Setting up a Todo application in Rails"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec09"/>Setting up a Todo application in Rails</h1></div></div></div><p>Since this book is<a id="id7" class="indexterm"/> targeted for Rails developers, I assume that<a id="id8" class="indexterm"/> you already have basic knowledge of Rails development. You should also have Rails and Ruby installed in your machine to start with.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note03"/>Note</h3><p>While writing this book, Ruby 2.1.1 and Rails 4.1.4 was used.</p><p>Let's first understand what this Todo application will do. Our application will allow us to create, update, and delete items from the Todo list. We will first analyze the folders that are created while scaffolding this application and which of them are necessary for templating the application.</p></div></div><p>So, let's dip our feet into the water:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">First, we need to select our workspace, which can be any folder inside your system.

All our <a id="id13" class="indexterm"/>application's <a id="id14" class="indexterm"/>content will be present inside this folder.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The <code class="literal">assets</code> folder inside<a id="id15" class="indexterm"/> the <code class="literal">app</code> folder is the location to store all the static files like JavaScript, CSS, and Images. You can take a sneak peek inside them to look at the various files.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The <code class="literal">controllers</code> folder handles <a id="id16" class="indexterm"/>various requests<a id="id17" class="indexterm"/> and responses of the browser.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The <code class="literal">helpers</code> folder contains<a id="id18" class="indexterm"/> various helper methods both for the <code class="literal">views</code> and <code class="literal">controllers</code>.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The next folder <code class="literal">mailers</code>, contains<a id="id19" class="indexterm"/> all the necessary files to send an e-mail.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The <code class="literal">models</code> folder contains files<a id="id20" class="indexterm"/> that interact with the database.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Finally, we have the<a id="id21" class="indexterm"/> <code class="literal">views</code> folder, which contains all the <code class="literal">.erb</code> files that will be complied to HTML files.</li></ul></div><p>So, let's start the Rails server and check out our application on the browser:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to the <code class="literal">TODO</code> folder in the terminal and then type the following command to start a server:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>rails server</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>You can also use the following command:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>rails s</strong></span>
</pre></div></li><li class="listitem">You will see<a id="id22" class="indexterm"/> that the server is deployed under the port <code class="literal">3000</code>. So, type the following URL to view the application:<p>
<code class="literal">http://localhost:3000</code>.</p><p>You can also use the following URL: <code class="literal">http://0.0.0.0:3000</code>.</p></li><li class="listitem">If your <a id="id23" class="indexterm"/>application is properly set up, you should see the default page of Rails in the browser:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/7269OS_1_4.jpg" alt="Analyzing folder structure of a Rails application"/></div></li></ol></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Creating views"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec11"/>Creating views</h1></div></div></div><p>We will be using Rails' scaffold method to create models, views, and other necessary files that Rails needs<a id="id24" class="indexterm"/> to make our application live. Here's the set of tasks that our application should perform:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It should list <a id="id25" class="indexterm"/>out the pending items</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Every task should be clickable, and the details related to that item should be seen in a new view</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">We can edit that item's description and some other details</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">We can delete that item</li></ul></div><p>The task looks pretty lengthy, but any Rails developer would know how easy it is to do. We don't actually have to do anything to achieve it. We just have to pass a single scaffold command, and the rest will be taken care of.</p><p>Close the Rails server using <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>C</em></span> keys and then proceed as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">First, navigate to the project folder in the terminal. Then, pass the following command:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>rails g scaffold todo title:string description:text completed:boolean</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>This will create a new model called <code class="literal">todo</code> that has various fields like title, description, and completed. Each field has a type associated with it.</p></li><li class="listitem">Since we have created a new model, it has to be reflected in the database. So, let's migrate it:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>rake db:create db:migrate</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>The preceding code will create a new table inside a new database with the associated fields.</p></li><li class="listitem">Let's analyze what we have done. The scaffold command has created many HTML pages or views that are needed for managing the <code class="literal">todo</code> model. So, let's check out our application. We need to start our server again:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>rails s</strong></span>
</pre></div></li><li class="listitem">Go to the localhost page <code class="literal">http://localhost:3000</code> at port number <code class="literal">3000</code>.</li><li class="listitem">You should still see the Rails' default page. Now, type the URL: <code class="literal">http://localhost:3000/todos</code>.</li><li class="listitem">You should now see the application, as shown in the following screenshot:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/7269OS_1_5.jpg" alt="Creating views"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Click on <span class="strong"><strong>New Todo</strong></span>, you will be taken to a form which allows you to fill out various fields that<a id="id26" class="indexterm"/> we had earlier created. Let's create our first todo and click on <span class="strong"><strong>submit</strong></span>. It will be shown on the listing page:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/7269OS_1_6.jpg" alt="Creating views"/></div></li></ol></div><p>It was easy, wasn't it? We haven't done anything yet. That's the power of Rails, which people are crazy <a id="id27" class="indexterm"/>about.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Styling views using CSS"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec12"/>Styling views using CSS</h1></div></div></div><p>Obviously, the<a id="id28" class="indexterm"/> application doesn't look insanely great. The table that has been presented is extremely confusing and needs some CSS styling. So, let's proceed to style our <a id="id29" class="indexterm"/>Rails application.</p><p>We will use the application's default CSS file to add and modify the styles:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Open <code class="literal">Bootstrap_Rails_Project</code>.</li><li class="listitem">Open the <code class="literal">TODO</code> folder; go to the <code class="literal">app</code> folder. Navigate to the <code class="literal">assets</code> folder. There you will find a folder named <code class="literal">stylesheets</code>. This folder contains all the CSS files of the application.</li></ol></div><p>Currently, you will find three different files: <code class="literal">application.css</code>, <code class="literal">scaffold.css.scss</code>, and <code class="literal">todos.css.scss</code>. The first file is an application level CSS file. Anything you write inside it will be applied to the whole application. The next two files are Sass files. Rails uses SASS to apply styles to the application. These SASS files are compiled in the CSS files and included in the application on the go.</p><p>We will be using a normal CSS file without any SASS to apply styles to our <code class="literal">Todo</code> application. Let's first proceed and analyze the HTML source code of our application. The screenshot is as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/7269OS_1_7.jpg" alt="Styling views using CSS"/></div><p>You can see that all the CSS files are loaded alphabetically here. This can be a serious problem where overriding CSS is concerned. We want our CSS file to be at the end. This will allow us to override the application level styles at some places in future.</p><p>So, let's rearrange<a id="id30" class="indexterm"/> the CSS files here.To do so, follow the given<a id="id31" class="indexterm"/> steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Open the <code class="literal">application.css</code> file using a text editor. There you can see some code lines with <code class="literal">require_</code> as their prefix. We need to tweak them a bit in order to get the desired result, as shown here:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/7269OS_1_8.jpg" alt="Styling views using CSS"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Let's create<a id="id32" class="indexterm"/> a new CSS file named <code class="literal">styles.css</code> in the same <code class="literal">stylesheets</code> folder. Now come back to the <code class="literal">application.css</code> file.</li><li class="listitem">Remove the<a id="id33" class="indexterm"/> following line from the file:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>*= require_tree</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>The preceding line was telling Rails to include all the CSS files in alphabetical order.</p></li><li class="listitem">Now, add the following line:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>*= require 'styles'</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>The preceding line will include <code class="literal">styles.css</code> in the application. Ensure that <code class="literal">application.css</code> looks as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/7269OS_1_9.jpg" alt="Styling views using CSS"/></div></li></ol></div><p>The <code class="literal">require_self</code> command includes the <code class="literal">application.css</code> file in the application. If we inspect the HTML <a id="id34" class="indexterm"/>source file now, we should see that there are only two CSS files included: <code class="literal">application.css</code> and <code class="literal">styles.css</code>. Hence, we are now<a id="id35" class="indexterm"/> safe to write CSS styles for the application.</p><div class="section" title="Redesigning the Todo application"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec07"/>Redesigning the Todo application</h2></div></div></div><p>In this section, We will<a id="id36" class="indexterm"/> write all the CSS files to redesign without<a id="id37" class="indexterm"/> the use of any framework. This will help us to better understand the amount of CSS code we have to write at the end for styling simple links and other HTML elements.</p><p>We are going to redesign our existing Todo application to something that looks like the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/7269OS_1_10.jpg" alt="Redesigning the Todo application"/></div><p>The preceding screenshot displays the redesigned version of the home page. As you can see, the list of<a id="id38" class="indexterm"/> TODO activities are now displayed properly<a id="id39" class="indexterm"/> in the middle of the screen inside a table-like structure. Even the action links (Show, Edit, and Destroy) have been redesigned to look like 3D buttons. Let's look at the redesigned version:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/7269OS_1_11.jpg" alt="Redesigning the Todo application"/></div><p>The preceding screenshot displays the redesigned version of the <code class="literal">New Todo</code> page. The form has been<a id="id40" class="indexterm"/> redesigned and a background color has been <a id="id41" class="indexterm"/>applied to it, as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/7269OS_1_12.jpg" alt="Redesigning the Todo application"/></div><p>The preceding screenshot shows the redesigned version of the <code class="literal">Edit TODO</code> screen, which is the same as the <code class="literal">New Todo</code> screen. The only difference here is the auto fill feature that fills the fields as per the data available in the database. The input fields are more spacious with a bigger<a id="id42" class="indexterm"/> font size for properly displaying the text<a id="id43" class="indexterm"/> contained in them. Let's see the screenshot of the <code class="literal">View Todo</code> page:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/7269OS_1_13.jpg" alt="Redesigning the Todo application"/></div><p>The preceding screenshot displays the redesigned version of the <code class="literal">View Todo</code> page. We have kept this page simple and clear for better readability. In all the pages, we have centered the content of the website.</p><p>Oh! That's lots of designing! Don't worry. We will get through it easily.</p><p>It is generally considered as a good practice to organize the designing process before jumping into it. In our Todo application, we have three different views:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Home page to list out all Todos: This is at <code class="literal">http://localhost:3000/todos</code></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">New Todo forms and Edit Todo forms: They both are the same view, which is reachable through two different types of URLs</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Show View Todo: It displays particular TODO details</li></ul></div><p>Let's begin by styling the Homepage:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Open <code class="literal">styles.css</code>, which we have recently created. All the styles that we are going to write should be written in this file.</li><li class="listitem">We will first<a id="id44" class="indexterm"/> clear the browser default margin and padding using the universal selector in CSS (*). So, our CSS for this will be:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">*{
margin: 0;
padding: 0
}</pre></div></li><li class="listitem">Let's style the title of the page first. If you check out the HTML source code of the page, you will see that it is an <code class="literal">H1</code> element. So, our CSS for this will be:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">h1{
padding: 20px;
text-align: center;
color: #5093C2;
}</pre></div><p>The preceding code makes the title appear in the center of the page. It also adds a light blue color to it. We have also created some space around it using the padding property of CSS. Refresh your page to verify it.</p></li><li class="listitem">It's time to <a id="id45" class="indexterm"/>decorate the <code class="literal">table</code> element. Our CSS for it will be:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">table{
  width: 800px;
  margin: auto;
text-align: center;
}</pre></div><p>The preceding code makes the table position to the center of the browser. First, we applied a width of <code class="literal">800px</code> to it and then we applied an auto positioned margin to it. Since the browser now knows the width of the table element, it will automatically divide the extra space on each side of it. This will make our table centered to the browser screen. The last property, <code class="literal">text-align</code> is used to align the text present inside the table.</p></li><li class="listitem">Let's apply some more styles to the elements present inside the table:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">td, th{
  padding: 10px;
  border: 1px solid #888888;
}</pre></div><p>In the preceding CSS code, we have applied styles to the <code class="literal">td</code> and <code class="literal">th</code> elements of the table element. We created some space around the text using padding. We also applied a border to each cell. It is a solid border of <code class="literal">1px</code> width and color <code class="literal">#888888</code>.</p></li><li class="listitem">It's time to<a id="id46" class="indexterm"/> design the application's links. We will try to make them appear like a button so that it appears more <a id="id47" class="indexterm"/>clickable. Our CSS for it will be:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">a{
display: block;
text-decoration: none;
width: 100px;
margin: 10px auto;
padding: 5px;
text-align: center;
background: #ccc;
color: #444;
font-size: 20px;
box-shadow: 4px 4px 0px #888;
font-weight: bold;
}</pre></div></li></ol></div><p>Links <code class="literal">&lt;a&gt;</code> are inline HTML elements. Hence in the first line, we have made it look like a block-level element using the <code class="literal">display</code> property. Now, we can apply width and margin to it. Just like we did to our table element; we will also apply a particular width and make all the links appear centered to their parent elements. We have also applied a padding of <code class="literal">5px</code> to create space around the link text.</p><p>To color the links, we applied background to it, and to make the text appear more distinct in this background, we applied a color property to it. We have also played with the shadow of the button to make it appear more 3D.</p><p>Make sure to refresh the browser screen to see the changes we are continuously applying. Hope you are enjoying the process of designing the application.</p><p>We have finally designed the home screen. The form is still not styled! Let's do it now:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Click on the <code class="literal">New Todo</code> file and let's style it:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">form{
  width: 300px;
  margin: auto;
  background: #ccc;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 1px solid #444;
}</pre></div><p>We applied proper width to the form and made it appear at the center of the screen. We have also given a decent background color to it. Padding and border is also applied to make it look more spacious and flat.</p></li><li class="listitem">Next, we have to design the labels and input fields. If you check out the HTML source of this page, you will see that every label, and its associated input field, is wrapped inside a <code class="literal">div</code> which has a <code class="literal">field</code> class. Remember that these classes and the HTML structures are not written by us. These have been autogenerated by Rails. We are just working with the CSS file.</li><li class="listitem">Now, we will<a id="id48" class="indexterm"/> use the <code class="literal">field</code> class to apply style to the elements present inside the <code class="literal">New Todo</code> view. Here we will design the label, input field, and <code class="literal">textarea</code> element:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">.field{
  padding: 10px 0;
}

.field label{
	font-weight: bold;
}

.field input, .field textarea{
  padding: 8px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  border-radius: 5px;
  font-size: 18px;
  width: 280px;
}</pre></div><p>We applied a decent space inside the <code class="literal">field</code> with <code class="literal">div</code> element. Here, we have give two different values to the padding property. The first value is for creating spaces to the top and bottom, whereas the next value will be used for the left and right side.</p></li><li class="listitem">Next, we applied style to the label element of the <code class="literal">field</code> element. We have made it appear bold using the<a id="id49" class="indexterm"/> <code class="literal">font-weight</code> property. Lastly, we gave both the input fields and <code class="literal">textarea</code> the same set of CSS styles. We made them look spacious using padding. A border property is applied to get rid of the browser default border around the input and textarea elements. We also applied border-radius to make the corners a little rounded. Finally, we fixed the width of both the textarea and input elements so that they appear properly aligned.</li><li class="listitem">It's time to design the last element in this HTML page, the <code class="literal">Create Todo</code> button:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">.actions input{
  padding: 8px;
  border: 1px solid #CCC;
  border-radius: 5px;
  font-size: 18px;
  width: 280px;
  background: #83B5D8;
  color: #444;
}</pre></div><p>Most of the CSS styles that we applied here are similar to what we have applied to the input and textarea element. Here, we have added two extra properties, <code class="literal">background</code> and <code class="literal">color</code> to make it look different and stand out properly in the form.</p></li><li class="listitem">We have <a id="id50" class="indexterm"/>successfully designed the <code class="literal">New Todo</code> and <code class="literal">Edit Todo</code> pages. We are now only left with the <code class="literal">Show Todo</code> page. So, without any further delay, let's first check out the page. Click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Show</strong></span> link.<p>Most of the content is already styled by us. We are only left with designing the text on this page, the code is as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">p{
  width: 350px;
  font-size: 20px;
  margin: auto;
  padding: 10px 0;
  color: #444;
}

p#notice{
  color: #76a3da;
}</pre></div><p>We applied a fixed width to the <code class="literal">p</code> element and made it appear to the center of the screen using the margin property. We also applied a decent font size to them. Now, let's separate them from each other using the margin and padding properties.</p></li></ol></div><p>This page is also shown after the <code class="literal">New Todo</code> or <code class="literal">Edit Todo</code> pages with a notice at the top. This element has an <code class="literal">id</code> element, which is used to show the status, whether a new <code class="literal">todo</code> was successfully created or an existing <code class="literal">todo</code> was successfully updated. Using CSS, we have applied style to it. Make sure that you are not giving any space between <code class="literal">p</code> and <code class="literal">#notice</code> in the preceding CSS code. We are targeting the <code class="literal">p</code> tag, which has an id, <code class="literal">#notice</code>, so spaces shouldn't be present between the selectors.</p><p>Congrats! We have successfully completed designing the whole application.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip02"/>Tip</h3><p>

<div class="section" title="Challenges in styling a Rails application traditionally"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec13"/>Challenges in styling a Rails application traditionally</h1></div></div></div><p>The application which we have created was so basic that we did not write a single line of code for its logic part. We didn't even touch the HTML layout of the application. You have seen how complex the CSS styling can be at some places, such as designing a link. The CSS which we <a id="id51" class="indexterm"/>have written here is very poorly organized. We have a target element level selector at many places to apply styles to them. This is considered as a very poor way of designing.</p><p>Our CSS code was not segregated into various, smaller parts. All the styles were written directly in one file, <code class="literal">styles.css</code>. In the coming chapters, we will see how we can use SASS to apply styles to our Rails applications. Using SASS, we can bring logic to the CSS codes.</p><p>We will also overcome the difficulties of styling each and every element in our Rails application using Bootstrap. You will realize how easy it can become for a Non-CSS developer to design a high-end application using Bootstrap. You won't write a single piece of CSS code when using Bootstrap. Its developers have written a bunch of CSS codes for you.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec14"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>The main intention of this chapter, was to brief you on how to develop and design a simple Rails application without the help of any CSS frontend frameworks. We manually styled the application by creating an external CSS file <code class="literal">styles.css</code> and importing it into the application using another CSS file <code class="literal">application.css</code>. We also discussed the complexities that a novice web designer might face on directly styling the application.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will get our hands dirty with Bootstrap. We will learn what it is, and how it can help to design a Rails application quickly. We will also learn how to integrate Bootstrap with the Rails application.</p></div></body></html>
