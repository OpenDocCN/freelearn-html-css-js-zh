- en: Over the past few years, Node.js has found its way into the technology stack
    of Fortune 500 companies, mobile-first start-ups, successful Internet-based businesses,
    and other enterprises. In addition to validating its power as a platform, this
    success has exposed a shortage of tools for managing, deploying, and monitoring
    Node.js applications. Even though the Node.js community is open and collaborative,
    comprehensive information on how professional Node developers design, test, and
    push their code into production environments is hard to find.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is an attempt to close that gap in knowledge by explaining and documenting
    techniques and tools that working Node.js developers can use to create scalable,
    smart, robust, and maintainable software for the enterprise.

- en: After a brief introduction to Node and the philosophy behind its design, you
    will learn how to install and update your applications on local servers and across
    the cloud. This foundation is then built upon by proceeding step by step through
    load balancing and other scaling techniques, explaining how to handle sudden changes
    in traffic volume and shape, implement version control, and design memory-efficient,
    stateful, distributed applications.

    systems, you will need to test and deploy them. Filled with real-world code examples,
    this book is structured as a progressive workbook explaining strategies for success
    to be used during each stage of the testing, deploying, monitoring, and maintaining
    marathon that every successful piece of software runs.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Appreciating Node"), *Appreciating Node*,
    goes into the thinking behind Node.js, helping you to think clearly about what
    Node.js is good at, what it is less good at, and how to leverage Node.js to solve
    real-world challenges.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Installing and Virtualizing Node Servers"),
    *Installing and Virtualizing Node Servers*, teaches you how to create a basic
    Node.js application and get it running on a server. You will also learn how to
    do the same thing on certain popular cloud-hosting providers, such as DigitalOcean
    and Heroku, additionally learning how to use Docker to create lightweight, easily
    replicable, virtual machines.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Scaling Node"), *Scaling Node*, explores
    both vertical and horizontal scaling techniques. You will learn how to use the
    cluster module to maximize Node''s effectiveness on a single server and how to
    coordinate many distributed Node.js servers to handle increasing network traffic,
    learning about Nginx load balancing, setting up proxies using message queues,
    and coordinating interprocess communication in the process.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Managing Memory and Space"), *Managing Memory
    and Space*, demonstrates how good engineering practices never go out of style.
    We start with a discussion of microservices, introducing general techniques to
    design systems composed of small, focused, communicating processes. Next comes
    a deep exploration of how to optimize JavaScript, particularly for the V8 compiler.
    Beginning with several examples of memory-efficient ways to store and retrieve
    event data in Redis, we look at caching strategies, session management, and using
    CDNs to reduce server load.'

    explains strategies to effectively monitor your application once it has been deployed.
    Examples of using various third-party monitoring tools are included as well as
    examples outlining how you can build your own custom system sampling and logging
    modules. Finally, we look at debugging techniques, examining several tools and
    strategies to help you find and prevent runtime bottlenecks.'

    introduces certain considerations when creating a build pipeline for your application.
    Full examples of using Gulp, Browserify, and npm to create build tools are provided
    as well as information on testing with Mocha, mocking with Sinon, and using PhantomJS
    for headless browser testing.'

    Maintaining*, walks you through the entire deployment pipleline, from setting
    up virtualized development environments to building continuous integration into
    your workflow. You will learn about using GitHub webhooks and Vagrant and using
    Jenkins to automate your deployment process. Additionally, the npm package manager
    will be fully dissected, and strategies for dependency management will be discussed.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is designed for Node.js developers who are ready to deploy large Node.js
    applications in production environments. It is designed to teach intermediate
    Node.js developers about the platform in more detail by situating examples in
    realistic contexts, focusing on modular design, and using extensive testing, active
    monitoring, and team-focused maintenance strategies. Those who are interested
    in improving the quality and efficiency of the JavaScript/Node programs they write
    and in delivering robust systems that withstand enterprise-level traffic, will
    enjoy this book. DevOps engineers without experience with the Node.js platform
    will also gain valuable information on how the techniques they already know are
    being implemented by the Node.js community.
