- en: Serverless is a buzzword created to identify cloud services that are totally
    managed by the provider and have a different billing model where you pay only
    for the time that you use them, measured in a granularity of tenths of a second
    and not hours. Serverless Computing allows a wide range of applications to benefit
    from reduced costs, faster development, and much less trouble with availability
    and scalability. Those are enough reasons for you to start learning how to build
    serverless applications.

- en: Besides teaching you what is and how to use serverless, this book offers a broader
    view on the subject. Serverless is frequently associated with FaaS and people
    don't realize that you can do much more with serverless than just running functions
    on demand. Serverless offers many services for databases, security, notifications,
    and others. I will teach you how to use them.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book assumes previous knowledge of web development using JavaScript and
    Node.js. While you have many options of programming languages to develop a serverless
    application, all code examples of this book uses Node, so some basic knowledge
    of Node.js is necessary at least to understand how npm and the JavaScript ES6
    syntax are used.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are many cloud providers that offer serverless services, but this book
    focuses on AWS. You don't need to have prior knowledge of AWS because we will
    cover the basics too, but you will need to create an account to develop and test
    the code examples. If it is a brand new account, AWS offers a free tier of 12
    months for you to learn and develop without any cost.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book was designed for web developers who want to use cloud services to
    be more productive, reducing the time wasted on configuration and maintenance
    of the infrastructure or for developers who want to build solutions using existing
    services to solve common problems with very little effort.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, as I work as a full-stack developer, my job requires me to understand
    a little bit of everything such as frontend, backend, databases, security, and
    DevOps. So I tried to give in this book a broad view of web development using
    the serverless concept. If you have a similar role or, at least, want to learn
    more about the different layers of web development, this book will suit you well.
