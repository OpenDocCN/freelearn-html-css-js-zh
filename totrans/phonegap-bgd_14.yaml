- en: In earlier chapters, we have seen several ways to run/debug our PhoneGap project.
    The easiest way is to use the PhoneGap Developer App. It's a mobile application
    available for Windows, Android, and iOS platforms. Once you have installed the
    mobile application, you can easily test your project without actually building
    and installing the application on your physical device connected to the same wireless
    network as your desktop.

    the PhoneGap command-line tool to start a local server listening on an IP address.

    on the command line, and click the **Connect** button. Now, your desktop computer
    and the mobile device will be wirelessly paired, and you can see your app on the
    device. Any changes made to the code will be instantly reflected on the device.
    The device APIs that do not work on browsers, will be working on your device even
    without installing the application.

- en: To make our life easier, we now have a desktop app and you are now free to use
    it, instead of the PhoneGap command-line interface. You can create a new PhoneGap
    project, import an existing one, and start the local server with a single click.
    It's still not a mature product and many features are getting added every month.
