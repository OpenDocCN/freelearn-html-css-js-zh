The styling process becomes more difficult if the developer is a newbie and has minimal knowledge of CSS. Bootstrap helps to solve this issue. It gives you access to some of the popular, ready-to-use reusable components such as stylish navigation bars, image containers, popovers, and so on. All you have to do is copy and customize the markup of the component you want to use.</p><p>In this chapter, you will understand what Bootstrap is, and how it is important for a Rails developer. We will see how to download and use Bootstrap in our Rails projects. We will again create the same Todo application in this chapter and apply Bootstrap styles to it.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What is Bootstrap?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Installing Bootstrap in a Rails project</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="What is Bootstrap?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec15"/>What is Bootstrap?</h1></div></div></div><p>Bootstrap is a <a id="id52" class="indexterm"/>complete frontend framework that helps in developing web applications without having to worry about its frontend. If you are a developer and your main focus is to showcase the power of your application without putting any efforts on CSS designing, then Bootstrap is for you. It allows developers to select from a range of popular reusable HTML components that are previously developed and styled by Bootstrap.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/7269OS_2_1.jpg" alt="What is Bootstrap?"/></div><p>Let's imagine a situation. Thomas is a Rails developer. He creates a powerful e-commerce shopping system using Rails. The system has many features which are normally expected <a id="id53" class="indexterm"/>from a shopping website. Thomas puts his extra effort on securing the application, and he made the system ready to use. Then comes the time when Thomas has to finally represent this application to venture capitalists to get some funding in order to start his project. But wait, Thomas did nothing to make his application presentable. His application contains only basic HTML markup with almost negligible CSS styling in it. Will his application make an impact?</p><p>The answer is, definitely not. Though Thomas was able to create a robust Rails application, it lacked presentation ability. His lack of proper CSS knowledge was the main reason that debarred him from creating a powerful impact for his project.</p><p>It is always important to balance both the frontend and backend capability for every developer. If you can't represent your application in a presentable manner, then it is definitely of no use. There might be some developers who will go forward after learning a lesson from a similar event, as described in the preceding example. They will try hard and learn web designing using CSS irrespective of whether they have interest in that area. By doing this, they are forgetting that designing is a completely different field from what they were previously doing. It is the work of UX/UI developers.</p><p>Bootstrap developers have written many CSS definitions that can be directly plugged into our projects to represent it. It is also an open source project which is licensed under MIT. This gives you freedom to use it on any type of projects without worrying about the licensing issues. Why<a id="id54" class="indexterm"/> should we reinvent the wheel, when someone has already done the job for us? Developers who are focused on rapid application development should consider using Bootstrap in their every project.</p><p>Bootstrap is not limited to just providing better CSS components to the developers. It is a <span class="strong"><strong>mobile first</strong></span> framework. This means<a id="id55" class="indexterm"/> that anything you write in your application using Bootstrap will be compatible even on smaller mobile devices. Bootstrap-powered applications can scale beautifully from extremely small devices like iPhones to larger displays like Retina displays. It helps you to write a single codebase and use it everywhere. With the advancement of technology, even native iOS and Android applications can be written using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript today. They are called <span class="strong"><strong>Hybrid applications</strong></span>
<a id="id56" class="indexterm"/> that are ported into the native platforms using tools like PhoneGap. Imagine that your Rails application is being used in all types of devices like mobiles, smart TVs, tablets, and even desktop screens. Awesome! Isn't it?</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Installing Bootstrap in a Rails project"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec16"/>Installing Bootstrap in a Rails project</h1></div></div></div><p>Bootstrap is simply a package of CSS, JavaScript, and font files. You must be confused why we used the<a id="id57" class="indexterm"/> term installing with Bootstrap here. Well, there are two different ways of using Bootstrap in Rails. The first one is to directly copy<a id="id58" class="indexterm"/> the Bootstrap files at proper places in the Rails project. The second one is the <span class="emphasis"><em>Bootstrap Sass way</em></span>. It is because of the second way that we used the term installing. It also comes as a gemset that can be bundle installed in any Rails project. We will explore both the ways in detail in this section.</p><p>There's also a third way, using Bootstrap files from CDN, which is the simplest of all. We will explore this at the end.</p><div class="section" title="Placing Bootstrap files in a Rails project"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec08"/>Placing Bootstrap files in a Rails project</h2></div></div></div><p>This is the first method<a id="id59" class="indexterm"/> of using Bootstrap in Rails. Many Rails developers get this method wrong. Placing the Bootstrap files properly is very<a id="id60" class="indexterm"/> important to activate Bootstrap. Follow these steps to place Bootstrap files:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Let's create a new Rails project. This time we will name it as the <code class="literal">Rails_Bootstrap_Project</code> command, as follows:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>rails new Rails_Bootstrap_Project</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>As usual, the preceding code will run various other commands and will take some time to complete. We will not discuss about various folders that are created inside this Rails project, as this was already covered in the previous chapter.</p></li><li class="listitem">Let's create a<a id="id61" class="indexterm"/> new model in Rails called <code class="literal">todos</code> using the<a id="id62" class="indexterm"/> scaffolding command, as follows:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>rails g scaffold todos title:string description:text completed:boolean</strong></span>
</pre></div></li><li class="listitem">Let's also make this change in the database by using the migrate command, as follows:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>rake db:migrate</strong></span>
</pre></div></li><li class="listitem">You should get a successful migration message. It's time to start the server and check out the Todo application.<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>rails s</strong></span>
</pre></div></li></ol></div><p>You can now visit <code class="literal">http://localhost:3000/todos</code> and click on <span class="strong"><strong>New Todo</strong></span>. The application should work, and you will get a screenshot, as follows:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/7269OS_2_2.jpg" alt="Placing Bootstrap files in a Rails project"/></div><p>Once the<a id="id63" class="indexterm"/> installation is complete, we will get a folder called <code class="literal">Rails_Bootstrap_Project</code> with lots of files inside it. If you are a Rails developer, you <a id="id64" class="indexterm"/>will definitely be tempted to jump directly into it. Let's keep this project as it is for the time being and proceed to download Bootstrap from its official website. The steps are:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Go to <a class="ulink" href="http://getbootstrap.com">http://getbootstrap.com</a> and <a id="id65" class="indexterm"/>click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Download Bootstrap</strong></span> button. It will take you to another page with three different options available.</li><li class="listitem">Select the first button which simply says <span class="strong"><strong>Download Bootstrap</strong></span>. A zipped package will start downloading.</li><li class="listitem">After the downloading is over, extract all the files. You can see three different folders present inside the default Bootstrap package, <code class="literal">css</code>, <code class="literal">js</code>, and <code class="literal">fonts</code>. We need to get all these files properly in our Rails project in order to make Bootstrap work.</li></ol></div><p>Every Bootstrap package comes with a standard set of files. The <code class="literal">css</code> folder contains four different CSS files. The first two CSS files are: <code class="literal">bootstrap.css</code> and <code class="literal">bootstrap.min.css</code>. Both of these files are exactly the same, except the way they are created. Here, <code class="literal">bootstrap.css</code> is a document version whereas <code class="literal">bootstrap.min.css</code> is a minified version. You will not find any comments or proper indentation in the minified version. A minified <a id="id66" class="indexterm"/>version is good for using in projects that are ready for production, as it is smaller in size.</p><p>The next two files, <code class="literal">bootstrap.theme.css</code> and <code class="literal">bootstrap.theme.min.css</code>, are theme files from Bootstrap. Bootstrap has created its own theme file to override its own default style on various components. They are completely optional. Personally, I have never used them. These<a id="id67" class="indexterm"/> two theme files are also exactly the same. The first one is a documented version while the second is a minified version.</p><p>Moving on to the <code class="literal">js</code> folder of the Bootstrap package, we will find two different JavaScript files: <code class="literal">bootstrap.js</code> and <code class="literal">bootstrap.min.js</code>. Again, these two files are exactly similar in nature. The former is a documented version while the latter is a minified version. This is the main Bootstrap JavaScript file. There are many components like navigation bar which depend on this file to function properly. Bootstrap's JavaScript components depend on jQuery. We do not get jQuery, out of the box, in the Bootstrap's package. But, it is necessary to include in our application. Generally, all the Rails projects include jQuery in them. Hence, we don't have to include it separately.</p><p>Bootstrap comes with a set of icons that can be used in our Rails application. These icons are called <span class="strong"><strong>Glyphicons</strong></span>. Unlike other icons which are images, these icons are fonts. All the icons are present in various font files inside the <code class="literal">fonts</code> folder of the Bootstrap package.</p><p>Now that we have taken a walkthrough of all the files in the Bootstrap package, let's start importing them in our Rails application using the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Let's move the CSS file first. Copy <code class="literal">bootstrap.min.css</code> from the CSS folder and place it in the <code class="literal">stylesheets</code> folder of the Rails application by navigating to <code class="literal">vendor/assets/stylesheets</code>:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/7269OS_2_3.jpg" alt="Placing Bootstrap files in a Rails project"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Next, copy<a id="id68" class="indexterm"/> <code class="literal">bootstrap.min.js</code> from<a id="id69" class="indexterm"/> the <code class="literal">js</code> folder and paste it in the <code class="literal">javascripts</code> folder of the Rails application by navigating to <code class="literal">vendor/assets/javascripts</code>:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/7269OS_2_4.jpg" alt="Placing Bootstrap files in a Rails project"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Copy the<a id="id70" class="indexterm"/> complete <code class="literal">fonts</code> folder<a id="id71" class="indexterm"/> and place it in the <code class="literal">assets</code> file under <code class="literal">vendor</code> folder:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/7269OS_2_5.jpg" alt="Placing Bootstrap files in a Rails project"/></div><p>We have<a id="id72" class="indexterm"/> all the Bootstrap files in the <code class="literal">vendors/assets</code> folder now. It's time to link them from<a id="id73" class="indexterm"/> the default Rails CSS and JavaScript files.</p></li><li class="listitem">Open the file <code class="literal">application.css</code> in the <code class="literal">stylesheets</code> folder by navigating to <code class="literal">app/assets/stylesheets</code>:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/7269OS_2_6.jpg" alt="Placing Bootstrap files in a Rails project"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Put the following<a id="id74" class="indexterm"/> line into the application of <code class="literal">.css</code> file:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">

</pre></div><p>This <a id="id75" class="indexterm"/>will include <code class="literal">bootstrap.min.css</code> from the <code class="literal">vendor/assets/stylesheets</code> directory. Bootstrap has written some CSS properties inside <code class="literal">bootstrap.min.css</code>, which provides the path to the font files. This path won't work here. We need to override it inside the <code class="literal">application.css</code> file.</p></li><li class="listitem">Paste the following lines into <code class="literal">application.css</code>:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">@font-face {

<span class="strong"><strong>Content delivery network</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>CDN</strong></span>) is a way of hosting popular libraries in the cloud and allows developers to directly access these<a id="id82" class="indexterm"/> files<a id="id83" class="indexterm"/> whenever needed. There are some of the popular CDN service providers like<a id="id84" class="indexterm"/> Google Hosted Libraries (<a class="ulink" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide">https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide</a>), cdnjs (<a class="ulink" href="http://cdnjs.com/">http://cdnjs.com/</a>), CloudFlare (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.cloudflare.com/">http://www.cloudflare.com/</a>), and <a id="id85" class="indexterm"/>others.</p><p>Bootstrap also comes with<a id="id86" class="indexterm"/> a CDN support. They have hosted both the CSS and JavaScript file in their own cloud servers. Let's try to use CDN in a Rails project this time, using the following steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Create a new Rails project called <code class="literal">Rails_Bootstrap_CDN_project</code>:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>rails new Rails_Bootstrap_CDN_project</strong></span>

<span class="strong"><strong>rails db:migrate</strong></span>
</pre></div></li><li class="listitem">Once all the above steps are successfully completed, go to the newly created folder <code class="literal">Rails_Bootstrap_CDN_project</code>. Go to <code class="literal">app/assets/stylesheets</code> and open the <code class="literal">application.css</code> file.</li><li class="listitem">We need to import Bootstrap's CSS file from its CDN in this file. Hence, paste the following lines in it:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">@import "//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.1.1/css/bootstrap.min.css"</pre></div></li><li class="listitem">Next, we<a id="id87" class="indexterm"/> have to include Bootstrap's JavaScript file from its CDN into our main view. Go to <code class="literal">app/views/layouts</code> and open the <code class="literal">application.html.erb</code> file. Paste the following line either just above the <code class="literal">&lt;/head&gt;</code> tag or inside the body just above the <code class="literal">&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag.<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"> &lt;script src="//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.1.1/js/bootstrap.min.js"&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;</pre></div></li></ol></div><p>It's done! You have successfully imported all the Bootstrap files into your Rails package. Go ahead, run the server and check out the app. It should have Bootstrap's styles applied to it.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec17"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>Out of all the methods of importing/installing Bootstrap in a Rails project, I would definitely suggest you to go with the Sass way. Developers familiar with Sass should definitely go for it.</p><p>Sass allows developers to completely customize Bootstrap's default styles and behavior. As we will progress with this book, we will see how to customize Bootstrap through Sass. Sass brings modularity to the CSS world. It brings the programming capability in it. You can use variables, functions, inheritance, and so on using Sass.</p><p>CDN is another better alternative but is very risky. CDN is generally blocked in many secure networks. In such cases, your application will load without any Bootstrap files. CDN also reduces the performance of the web app by sending an extra request to a different network. Hope you have got a fair idea of what Bootstrap is through this chapter. It is an extremely useful framework that enforces rapid development by the use of its HTML and CSS components. In the coming chapters, we will see how to use some of the popular Bootstrap components in the Rails applications. We will see how easy it is to create a highly responsive Rails application using Bootstrap.</p></div></body></html>
