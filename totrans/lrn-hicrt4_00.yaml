    types—line/spline, column, pie, donut, scatter, bubble, area range, column range,
    gauge, solid gauge, pyramid, box plot, spider, waterfall, funnel, error bar, heatmaps,
    and 3D charts

    an excellent job in providing a comprehensive online reference, and each configuration
    is coupled with jsFiddle demos. This book also does not aim to be a chart design
    guide nor a tutorial on programming design with Highcharts.

    all the source code of each example. For step-by-step tutorials, the code is listed
    incrementally. If you want to experiment with the sample code, you are strongly
    recommended to download the code from the Packt Publishing website or visit [http://joekuan.org/Learning_Highcharts](http://joekuan.org/Learning_Highcharts)
    for online demos.

    should be comfortable with the language at an intermediate level. Some of the
    examples use jQuery as a quick way to access document elements and bind methods
    to events. Hence, a basic knowledge of jQuery should be sufficient. Some knowledge
    of jQuery UI would also be an advantage, as it is lightly used in [Chapter 10](ch10.html
    "Chapter 10. Highcharts APIs"), *Highcharts APIs* and [Chapter 11](ch11.html "Chapter 11. Highcharts
    Events"), *Highcharts Events*.
