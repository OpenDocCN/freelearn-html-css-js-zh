<p class="mce-root">Welcome to <em>D3.js Quick Start Guide</em>. In it, we'll be covering the basics of D3 through a series of large builds. By the end, you should have a strong enough grasp of the library to go out and build your own interactive data visualizations.</p>

<p><a href="3cfc36cc-7796-4847-9525-fa88795e6a5f.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Getting Started with D3.js</em>, <span>provides a high-level overview of what makes D3 so interesting. We examine what an SVG element is and set up our machine so that it is ready to create D3 code. We also take a look at this book's approach to learning and how it applies to the applications that we'll build.</span></p>
<p><a href="f40fadd5-f40b-43dc-a82d-206aac322123.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Using SVG to Create Images Using Code</em>, <span>covers the basics of SVG (base tags, basic elements, positioning, and styling). We also look at Bezier curves and how to draw organic shapes with them. We're now ready to learn how D3 can be used to modify these elements</span>.</p>
<p><a href="4c02d13e-8bf2-449a-8b13-eadd149cfda5.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Building an Interactive Scatter Plot</em>, explains static scatter plots and a shows how to build a table that displays its data.</p>
<p><a href="e503bfe5-4b90-47eb-bae0-d588a9b545d5.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Making a Basic Scatter Plot Interactive</em>, shows you as many useful modules as possible, with examples of daily activities that can be carried out and personal comments based on our experience of using them.</p>
<p><a href="3e25ba8b-b8df-4d67-a681-9cf94662d327.xhtml"/><a href="3e25ba8b-b8df-4d67-a681-9cf94662d327.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Create a Bar Graph Using a Data File</em>, covers many interesting use cases that any system administrator will need to run daily. Many other tasks can be performed as we show with customized playbooks. But not every script is considered as good automation. What matters is that the right nodes go from state A to state B with no errors and in a short time.</p>

<p><a href="aacc693a-f51f-4d50-832c-db2cd3af3b7f.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Animating SVG Elements to Create an Interactive Pie Chart</em>, shows how<span> a pie chart animates when you remove sections from it.</span></p>
<p><a href="f2a3decf-b45f-4f70-83d3-8d9dbb7213fb.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Use Physics to Create a Force Directed Graph</em>, <span>shows how to use D3 to create a graph that visualizes relationships between various nodes of data. This can be very useful in scenarios such as graphing a friend network, showing parent/child company relationships, or displaying a company's staff hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><a href="9e68fb4c-044a-40ec-ba46-3181bc2b7b5f.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Mapping</em>, discusses GeoJSON, what it's used for, and why it differs from more general JSON data. We also cover how to use D3 to create a projection and render GeoJSON data as a map<span>.</span></p>

<p>This book assumes a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, and what a server is, in order to be able to work with the code and concepts given in this book.</p>
<p>For this book you really only need to download and install the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chrome, available at <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">https://www.google.com/chrome/</a>: a web browser so that we can view our visualizations.</li>
<li>Node: <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">https://nodejs.org/en/</a>: This allows us to run JavaScript from the terminal. In <a href="e503bfe5-4b90-47eb-bae0-d588a9b545d5.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Making a Basic Scatter Plot Interactive</em>, we will use it so that we can make AJAX calls.</li>
<li>A code editor. I'd suggest Atom if you're new to coding: <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">https://atom.io/</a>.<a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank"/></li>

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "Mount the downloaded <kbd>WebStorm-10*.dmg</kbd> disk image file as another disk in your system."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>&lt;<span class="pl-ent">circle</span> <span class="pl-e">r</span>=<span class="pl-s">50</span> <span class="pl-e">cx</span>=<span class="pl-s">50</span> <span class="pl-e">cy</span>=<span class="pl-s">50</span> <span class="pl-e">fill</span>=<span class="pl-s">red</span> <span class="pl-e">stroke</span>=<span class="pl-s">blue</span> <span class="pl-e">stroke-width</span>=<span class="pl-s">5</span>&gt;&lt;/<span class="pl-ent">circle</span>&gt;</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>&lt;<span class="pl-ent">head</span>&gt;
       <strong>&lt;<span class="pl-ent">link</span> <span class="pl-e">rel</span>=<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>stylesheet<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span> <span class="pl-e">href</span>=<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>app.css<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>&gt;</strong>
&lt;/<span class="pl-ent">head</span>&gt;</pre>
<p class="mce-root"><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Select <span class="packt_screen">System info</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Administration</span> panel.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
