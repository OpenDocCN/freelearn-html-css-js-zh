<h1 class="chapterTitle" id="_idParaDest-161">Getting Started with Inking Tools</h1>
<p class="normal">Back in the early days of comics, pencil lines were too light to be picked up by the cameras used to replicate comic art. So, artists used a brush or pen and black ink to redraw over the pencil lines and make them dark enough for the cameras to pick up. Inking has become an art in and of itself. Clip Studio Paint has some of the best inking tools in the digital art world, packaged with it when you purchase the software. There are also a multitude of third-party tools available either for free or to purchase that provide specialty inking functionalities that give different looks and feels to inked lines.</p>
<p class="normal">We are going to start with a step-by-step inking process in the first section, so don’t worry if you don’t know much about digital inking! You will also see many of the inking tools Clip Studio Paint offers, then we will find out how to customize them in a later section of this chapter. Finally, we will end the chapter by finding out how to use inking tools on vector layers!</p>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we are going to talk about the following topics:</p>

</ul>
<p class="normal">Let’s get started!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-162">Principles of inking</h1>
<p class="normal">Inking in the world <a id="_idIndexMarker625"/>of non-digital tools is the process of using pens or brushes and black India ink to finalize pencil lines and make them ready for toning or coloring. The printing presses back in the early days of comics weren’t capable of printing grayscale, so dark black ink lines were needed to reproduce the comic art.</p>
<p class="normal">In the digital world, we aren’t restricted to simply black ink for our lines, and we have a multitude of tools we can use to make our finalized lines. There is an art to good inking that we should discuss briefly.</p>
<p class="normal">Inking is the art of taking a rough pencil sketch and providing finalized edges, volume, and a sense of light and shadow. To see this process in action, let’s take a look at an inking from a sketch to final shades and examine how the inked lines accentuate the mood of the piece.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-163">Creating a great pencil sketch</h2>
<p class="normal">Before you start inking, you<a id="_idIndexMarker626"/> need to create the <a id="_idIndexMarker627"/>pencil sketch, which we learned about in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 3</em>, <em class="italic">Penciling: Layer and Later Property Palettes</em>. In that chapter, we touched on how to use the pencil sketch to establish characters’ proportions. Before we start inking, let’s touch on that method again while introducing some more complexity – this time looking at <strong class="screenText">perspective</strong>.</p>
<p class="normal">When you compose a visual, you should think about how perspective performs wonders when you want to create dynamism in a still image. Once you’re comfortable with proportions, delving into perspective is the natural next skill to learn to create great pencil sketches.</p>
<p class="normal">Perspective is something quite simple in theory, yet needs practice to utilize in art. We know that objects closer to you look bigger than objects far away. In the image to the left, we can see I drew my 7-heads proportion characters in one frame with perspective on the right, which created a more dramatic look than just lining them up without overlapping or perspective.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_08_8.1.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.1: Image of a composition in pencil sketch</p>
<p class="normal">In the preceding <a id="_idIndexMarker628"/>sketch, the lady in front is taking a group <a id="_idIndexMarker629"/>selfie, which means she is the closest object to the camera, such that her right arm looks big, hiding her body. Then the character on the right is the next closest object, drawn slightly smaller. Finally, the character at the rear, standing far from the camera, has his body hidden by the other two characters.</p>
<p class="normal">If you drew all three characters in separate layers, it would be easier to move them individually to edit the composition. For example, you could select each individual character and move them around the composition, resizing them as you go. You can edit or re-sketch till you feel it looks right.</p>
<p class="normal">Once you have the basic form established in the first few sketches, you’ll want to think about adding detail. It’s best to do this iteratively, adding new layers and progressively delving into more complexity.</p>
<p class="normal">Depending on what style of manga you want to create, learning how to draw details could be a long and rewarding journey for you. Really, it is a never-ending experience. That said, one basic aspect to get right is creating expressions. Along with perspective, training yourself to draw expressions will produce much livelier artwork!</p>
<p class="normal">Take a look at the character below, expressing a gallery of emotions:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_08_8.2.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.2: Screenshot of various facial expressions</p>
<p class="normal">As you can see, a <a id="_idIndexMarker630"/>lot of a person’s expression <a id="_idIndexMarker631"/>comes from their mouth and their eyes. If you’re new to drawing expressions, this is worth thinking about and practicing – how does a character frown with their eyes? How do they smile with their eyes? Try drafting different expressions on top of each other using different layers. Notice how much difference the position of their eyebrows makes. Additionally, you’ll want to think about blushes, wincing marks around the eyes, and other details.</p>
<p class="normal">As with all drawing skills, the best way to learn is by studying how others do it, and then practicing it yourself. You can also use Clip Studio Paint materials or images downloaded online and try tracing their expressions.</p>
<p class="normal">As you may have noticed, <em class="italic">Figure 8.2</em> is not a messy sketch, but an inked composition. Now that you have used pencil sketches to work on your art to the point that you’re happy with it, it’s time to ink your art in the same way, cleaning it up and making a<a id="_idIndexMarker632"/> few extra artistic decisions along<a id="_idIndexMarker633"/> the way.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-164">Beginning inking</h2>
<p class="normal">Once you think your <a id="_idIndexMarker634"/>sketch is ready to be redrawn in ink, turn the finalized pencil sketch blue using the <strong class="screenText">Layer Color</strong> settings on the <strong class="screenText">Layer Property</strong> palette, and decrease the <strong class="screenText">Opacity</strong> setting of the sketch layer to 30% to see the new inking lines more easily.</p>
<p class="normal">Don’t worry, your sketch should be quite rough at this stage, with multiple attempts at each line and a few guiding lines from organizing the perspective, the facial details, and so on. That is why we’ll be going over it now with finalized lines in ink.</p>
<p class="normal">When you ink the image, the most orthodox way to do this is using <strong class="screenText">G-pen</strong>, which is popular due to it having a higher touch and tilt sensitivity setting for outlines of characters, and the <strong class="screenText">mapping</strong> pen, which is great for drawing very fine lines over content, as well as detailing.</p>
<p class="normal">Higher touch and tilt sensitivity means the line width changes from fine to bold depending on how much pressure or tilt you put on your pen. This can be seen in the following screenshot of the <strong class="screenText">pen pressure</strong> setting and a corresponding line sample. </p>
<p class="normal">To change the <strong class="screenText">Pen pressure</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Tilt</strong> inputs, you can find the options by clicking the button to the right of the <strong class="screenText">Brush Size</strong> setting:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_08_8.3.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.3: Screenshot of high Pen pressure setting and line</p>
<p class="normal">The following screenshot shows an inactive pressure and tilt sensitivity setting, which means the pen’s width doesn’t change no matter how much pressure you put on it or how much you tilt your pen:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_08_8.4.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.4: Screenshot of low Pen pressure setting and line</p>
<p class="normal">We will explore<a id="_idIndexMarker635"/> more of the pen settings in the <em class="italic">Customizing pressure sensitivity settings</em> section later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="normal">Drawing with great control of line width gives the image a crafted and soft look, especially when you draw things such as human skin, hair, and fluffy dress garments—these would be perfect to create with a higher touch- and tilt-sensitive G-pen!</p>
<p class="normal">A mapping pen has less touch and tilt sensitivity, but I assure you that using it with the tiny brush setting and going around the details of hair, eyes, and clothing will give you a perfect and accurate look for the contents of your drawing. Let’s have another look at the inking tool that was used in <em class="italic">Figure 8.2:</em></p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_08_8.5.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.5: Screenshot of various facial expressions</p>
<p class="normal">Using these pens helps you depict the delicate details of facial expressions!</p>
<p class="normal">The following<a id="_idIndexMarker636"/> screenshot shows the first stage of inking using a <strong class="screenText">G-pen</strong> and <strong class="screenText">mapping</strong> pen:</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_08_8.6.png"/></p>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.6: Screenshot of the first inking stage</p>
<p class="normal">There are two <a id="_idIndexMarker637"/>things you might notice:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">The first thing is the line thickness; the outlines of characters are drawn with thicker <strong class="screenText">G-pen</strong> lines to make the characters stand out from the background, and details are added with thinner mapping pen lines. If all the lines were of the same thickness, readers of the manga would have trouble finding where to focus. For an extreme perspective scene, you can use very thick lines for the closest object!</li>
<li class="bulletList">The second thing is that there is already shade in this line drawing. Take a look under the characters’ faces, and under the flower crown, noticing how the black section that is filled with ink depicts shade. This is a trick to create a three-dimensional effect on a simple black-and-white line drawing.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">We can add more shade and dark color expressions in the next stage, as in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_08_8.7.png"/></p>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.7: Second inking stage</p>
<p class="normal">Boom! The character on the right has dark hair, the middle character has dark but shiny hair, and<a id="_idIndexMarker638"/> the left character has light-colored hair. You can express dark hair by adding some lines to create a closed section with any pen tool, filling the sections with the <strong class="screenText">Fill</strong> tool on the layer below, and leaving a small section untouched for a shiny hair effect.</p>
<p class="normal">Not just hair; if you look at their eyes, the eye color is also depicted in a different shade. The character on the left has a lighter eye color, so the eyes are not filled with black ink like the others. </p>
<p class="normal">What happens if we have a background too? See the following screenshot:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_08_8.8.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.8: Screenshot of the background inking stage</p>
<p class="normal">The trees, leaves, and floor tiles are added to the drawing! The background image was drawn<a id="_idIndexMarker639"/> in thinner lines with a mapping pen compared to the character outlines, because the nature in the background is further away from the camera and less important in this image. Additionally, you can change the color of the background layer to light gray. This helps create more contrast with the objects in the foreground.</p>
<p class="normal">But wait a minute… this image is visually too busy! You will need space between characters or objects and the background.</p>
<p class="normal">First, we will add a new layer between the layer that contains the characters and the layer with a background. Then, we use white to draw space around the character figures with brush tools. </p>
<p class="normal">In this way, you can emphasize the focus of the image, as seen in the following screenshot:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_08_8.9.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.9: Screenshot of the background with the extra inking stage</p>
<p class="normal">This is just a<a id="_idIndexMarker640"/> tiny change, but it makes a big difference in guiding readers’ eyes to the desired objects in the drawing. One last thing to add is a puddle of black shade underneath the characters to make them really stand out, as in the following screenshot:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_08_8.10.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.10: Screenshot of the last inking stage</p>
<p class="normal">By adding the darker <a id="_idIndexMarker641"/>shade underneath, we can see the characters clearly now.</p>
<p class="normal">Of course, there are lots of ways to do inking. Many inkers use the color black to fill certain spots to indicate deep shadows. Feathering, hatching, and cross-hatching can be used to add shading, detail, and texture. The following image is the same inked art but using hatching to shade:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_08_8.11.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.11: Screenshot of shading with hatching</p>
<p class="normal">There are even styles of art that use ink with no line weight, a style called <em class="italic">ligne claire</em>, or clear line. Inking is as individual as each artist’s style and if you’re new to it, it may take a while to develop your own style. The key is to keep practicing!</p>
<p class="normal">Now that we know some of the principles of inking, how to change the layer color of the pencil<a id="_idIndexMarker642"/> layer, how to use thin and thick lines, how to add shade, and finally how to draw a background, let’s explore some of the inking tools in Clip Studio Paint in the next section.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-165">Exploring inking tools</h1>
<p class="normal">Clip Studio Paint has <a id="_idIndexMarker643"/>a variety of tools for inking, and thanks to the customizable brush engine, we can also modify tools to better suit our needs. For the experienced inker, there are tools that mimic traditional inking tools, such as the G-pen, turnip pen, calligraphy pen, and textured pen. There are also a<a id="_idIndexMarker644"/> variety of marker tools that can be used for inking as well.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-166">Alternative inking tools</h2>
<p class="normal">There are some manga<a id="_idIndexMarker645"/> artists that decide to use the <strong class="screenText">Pencil</strong> tool for final inking while others just use it for drafts. One of the reasons for using <strong class="screenText">Pencil</strong> as a final inking tool is the “handmade” feeling it gives. Not only is it light and easy to draw with, but it also gives a warm, hand-drawn impression, just like looking at an artist’s sketchbook. The screenshot on the right shows a panel drawn with the <strong class="screenText">Pencil</strong> tool.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_08_8.12.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.12: Screenshot of a pencil drawing</p>
<p class="normal">There are differences here from a pen drawing, such as that the lines are not very smooth and clear, the shading is not a flat black patch, and we can still see pencil marks. </p>
<p class="normal">With the <strong class="screenText">Pencil</strong> tool, we can also create other art elements such as speech bubbles and sound effects in harmony with our art. Slice-of-life or fantasy story manga often use pencils or pastels for final ink drawings for a warm and cozy feeling.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s have a look at <a id="_idIndexMarker646"/>another alternative of using a brush instead of ink in the screenshot on the left.</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_08_8.13.png"/></p>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.13: Screenshot of a brush drawing</p>
<p class="normal">In this <a id="_idIndexMarker647"/>screenshot, we see a brush drawing and other brush mark samples. What’s great about using a brush is we can instantly change the visual to something dramatic and easily create black to gray tones. The shadow of the character at the bottom of the image shows textured gradation. The lines are not as smooth as those made with <strong class="screenText">Pen</strong> tools, but <strong class="screenText">Brush</strong> tools give us the space to have fun using smudges, smears, or blur effects. We often find manga artists using <strong class="screenText">Brush</strong> for horror, suspense, and traditional oriental-style manga.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Once you pick an inking tool, make sure to stick to that tool throughout the whole manga, except where you want to add a different impression to particular parts of the story, such as episodes from someone’s past or a dream sequence. For instance, if you started using the <strong class="screenText">G-pen</strong> in 12 pt, keep using it until the end. Otherwise, the visuals of the manga will not hold consistency, and readers will not be able to concentrate on the story anymore.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">G-pen</strong> default tool is pretty good as a substitute for a real brush and ink experience because of its pressure sensitivity settings, as I mentioned in the previous section.</p>
<p class="normal">I get a lot of people asking what inking tools I use. Personally, I use several inking tools from third-party designers that I love! You can download ready-made pens created by other Clip Studio Paint artists, some of which are priced. You can check out <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 18</em>, <em class="italic">Exploring the Clip Studio Assets and Animation</em>, to get to know more about these ready-made materials and how to download them.</p>
<p class="normal">But if you don’t want to pay<a id="_idIndexMarker648"/> for a tool, you can always make one that suits your needs and style! The “right-feeling” tool will vary for every artist because every artist is different and wants a different look from their tools. We will explore this more in the <em class="italic">Customizing pressure sensitivity settings </em>section later.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Having trouble getting smooth-looking inks? Ink while zoomed in! I find that zooming in to 250% on an image of 300 dpi or larger and then inking works best for me. The lines look a little shaky when I’m zoomed in, but upon zooming back out, the lines look smooth and crisp!</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Let’s briefly discuss each of the categories of tools that we can use to ink in Clip Studio Paint.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-167">Marker tools</h2>
<p class="normal">From Micron <a id="_idIndexMarker649"/>pens to <a id="_idIndexMarker650"/>the basic Sharpie, most artists have used marker tools on paper to ink their work at some point in their lives. In Clip Studio Paint, marker tools are characterized as having a set line width, meaning that they don’t get thicker or thinner no matter how light or hard we press with the stylus, as you can see in the comparison of pens and markers in the screenshot on the right.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_08_8.14.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.14: Screenshot of pen and marker samples</p>
<p class="normal">Even though the markers give us a line with no variation in width, they are still valuable in some inking situations. For instance, backgrounds with patterns of mascots and objects, machines, and other inorganic objects look great when inked with a line that has less variation:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_08_8.15.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.15: Screenshot marker samples</p>
<p class="normal">Despite not getting thicker and thinner as we press, we can always change the size of the marker tip to get some variation in our lines by making them thicker or thinner manually, instead of with pressure.</p>
<p class="normal">The marker tools<a id="_idIndexMarker651"/> can be found under the <strong class="screenText">Pen</strong> category as a tab of<a id="_idIndexMarker652"/> sub tools under that category. Here is a screenshot of the <strong class="screenText">Marker</strong> tools in the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> palette:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_08_8.16.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.16: Screenshot of the Marker Sub Tool palette</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s have a<a id="_idIndexMarker653"/> look at<a id="_idIndexMarker654"/> some more inking tools.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-168">Pen tools</h2>
<p class="normal">Pen tools are the<a id="_idIndexMarker655"/> primary tools for inking, both in the digital<a id="_idIndexMarker656"/> and the analogue art worlds. With a bit of practice, we can ink anything with pen tools. Pen tools in Clip Studio Paint have pressure sensitivity, allowing us to make thick and thin lines depending on how hard we press with the stylus.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Having issues with your tools in Clip Studio Paint? Go to the website of your tablet brand and make sure that you have the most up-to-date drivers for your model of tablet installed. Some of the most common software issues are just problems with outdated drivers. Make sure to have a backup of the previous drivers too, just in case there’s a bug in the newest drivers!</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">For the traditional artist switching to digital who inks with brush or nib pens, the pen tools in Clip Studio Paint are going to give you the most familiar feel when inking, especially if you have a tablet stylus with a changeable nib. Wacom brand tablets usually have different tips that can be put on the stylus to give a different feel against the tablet, whether it be extra friction to make the experience more like working on paper or a spring-loaded nib that gives the squishy feel of a brush or nib. So, if you have one of these tablets with a nib that can be changed, be sure to experiment with it! Also, you’ll want to make sure you have a few extra nibs on hand, because nibs can and will wear out over time and need to be replaced. You don’t want to have a stubby nib and no fresh one when there’s a deadline coming up!</p>
<p class="normal">The following screenshot shows the <strong class="screenText">Pen</strong> tool category in the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> palette:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_08_8.17.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 8.17: Screenshot of the Pen Sub Tool palette</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">If you find your hand sticking to your tablet (or smudging your tablet, for those with screens or working on tablet PCs), you’ll want to get a smudge guard! These gloves go on your dominant hand and are fingerless except for the pinkie and ring fingers, which have fabric to keep your skin from touching the tablet. You can make one yourself by getting a cheap pair of gloves and cutting off the thumb, pointer, and middle fingers, or you can buy one. A popular brand is <a href="http://www.smudgeguard.com">www.smudgeguard.com</a>.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">We have been looking into pen tools and marker tools and the differences between them in this section.</p>
<p class="normal">We can customize our inking tools in many ways, but one of the easiest ways to start making<a id="_idIndexMarker657"/> tools<a id="_idIndexMarker658"/> on our own is to change the pressure sensitivity settings. In the next section, we will duplicate an existing tool and adjust its settings to make our own custom inking tool.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-169">Customizing pressure sensitivity settings</h1>
<p class="normal">All artists have their<a id="_idIndexMarker659"/> own preference on how to tilt a pen and how much pressure they put on paper. We can control this by using traditional pens on paper, but we need to configure our digital tools to make them understand what our preferences are.</p>
<p class="normal">We’re going to create a sensitive pen that will give us thin lines, but also get thick rather quickly. Follow these steps to complete this exercise:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Select the <strong class="screenText">G-pen</strong> tool from the <strong class="screenText">Pen Sub Tool</strong> palette.</li>

<li class="numberedList" value="5">The <strong class="screenText">Minimum value</strong> slider <a id="_idIndexMarker660"/>controls how small our pen can get.

<li class="numberedList">The curve graph at the bottom marked <strong class="screenText">Pen pressure settings</strong> controls how quickly the pen goes from <strong class="screenText">0%</strong> to <strong class="screenText">100%</strong> as we increase the pressure on the stylus.

<li class="numberedList">The more control points you add to the curve, the more erratic the pen will behave. Experiment with the settings until you get the results you like!</li>
<li class="numberedList">Once you have finished adjusting the settings, close the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool Detail</strong> palette. You are now ready to use your new pen on your drawings!</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">Doesn’t it feel like your pen understands how you behave when you draw? Great, you can now change pressure settings anytime using the steps we learned in this section whenever you want more suitable drawing tools.</p>
<p class="normal">In the next <a id="_idIndexMarker662"/>section, we are going to discuss how to ink on vector layers. Yes, it’s different from inking on raster layers as we have been learning, but believe me, it’s equally useful. Let’s find out more!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-170">Inking on vector layers</h1>
<p class="normal">For a beginner<a id="_idIndexMarker663"/> inker, inking<a id="_idIndexMarker664"/> on a vector layer is very forgiving because of the editable nature of vector lines. (For more information on vector lines, see <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 10</em>, <em class="italic">Exploring</em> <em class="italic">Vector Layers.</em>) If you are just starting out with inking, or if you want to be able to draw an inked line once and then tweak it until it’s perfect, inking on a vector layer is going to be perfect for your needs! However, beginner inkers, remember that in the digital realm, even ink can be erased, and the <strong class="screenText">Undo</strong> button will forgive most sins. So long as you remember to begin inking on a layer separate from your sketch, you will be able to erase and tweak your lines regardless of whether you go with raster or vector inks.</p>
<p class="normal">For an example of how we can tweak ink lines on vector layers, let’s take a look at the screenshot on the right, showing lines we made with the <strong class="screenText">Pen</strong> tool and that hasn’t had any vector adjustments made yet.</p>

<p class="normal">Note that<a id="_idIndexMarker665"/> some<a id="_idIndexMarker666"/> of the lines are shaky and lack the smoothness of a confident inking hand seen in the previous example. After we use the <strong class="screenText">Control point</strong> tool and the <strong class="screenText">Simplify vector line </strong>tool on the lines, we end up with the smoother and more elegant lines, shown in the following screenshot:</p>

<p class="normal">Whether you ink on raster or vector layers is, of course, up to you and your preferences. The <a id="_idIndexMarker667"/>more <a id="_idIndexMarker668"/>you practice with inking, the better you will become! In the next section, we will look at some tips on how to ink comic panels effectively.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-171">Tips for inking comic panels</h1>
<p class="normal">Now that we have <a id="_idIndexMarker669"/>some foundational knowledge of inking and inking tools in Clip Studio Paint, let’s talk about inking a comic page. These are general tips, of course, because we could write an entire book just about inking comics (and entire books have, in fact, been written about this!). But for those just starting out, here are some general tips that make the inking process a little easier:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Start with the panels that you’re most excited about inking. In traditional inking, we would start from the opposite corner of our dominant hand and ink diagonally across the page and down to avoid smearing drying ink, but with digital inks, we don’t have to worry about that. Start with whatever panels you wish to ink first and move around the page as you like.</li>
<li class="bulletList">Remember to turn on the <strong class="screenText">Layer Color</strong> option on any pencil layers before beginning to ink. This ensures that we can easily see where we’ve inked already and any lines we may have missed and keeps us from inking on the wrong layer and having to start all over again.</li>
<li class="bulletList">Ink on separate layers for characters and backgrounds, or the foreground and background. I like to separate my characters from the backgrounds and then apply layer masks as needed. This not only allows me to adjust the position of characters or background elements more easily, but also ensures that backgrounds can be reused in other panels if needed.</li>
<li class="bulletList">Use the eraser tools or the transparent color to correct your mistakes. Remember that digital ink isn’t permanent! We can adjust it, delete the ink layer, and start over, or add textures using erasers or tools set to the <strong class="screenText">transparency</strong> option.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">If you really want to improve your inking, there are hundreds of resources on the internet where artists post their penciled work for others to ink and/or color. Make sure that you have the permission of the original artist to use this work, and that you give credit and a link to the artist’s website if you post your inked version somewhere! Practice is the best way to improve and to find your own style.</p>
<p class="normal">Now you know<a id="_idIndexMarker670"/> the basic inking methods that Clip Studio Paint offers. You also understand in real terms what digital inking is all about.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-172">Summary</h1>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we covered the reasons for inking and some basic principles for making clear and dynamic inked lines. We explored the <strong class="screenText">Marker</strong> and pen tools, two of our workhorses for making inks in Clip Studio Paint, and learned how to adjust the pressure settings in the <strong class="screenText">Pen</strong> tools to customize our tools. We talked about inking on vector layers and the benefits of doing so. Now you can take control of inking tools!</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s take another step in becoming a Clip Studio Paint master. In the next chapter, we will discuss how to ink some special effects. We will also make a brush with custom brush tips to produce a special effect, and discuss more of the special tools, such as creating textured ink brushes, which will expand your digital drawing utilities.</p>
