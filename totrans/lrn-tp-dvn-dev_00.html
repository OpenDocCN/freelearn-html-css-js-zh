<p class="mce-root">Type-driven development is an approach to programming that uses a static-type system to achieve desirable attributes, such as safety and efficiency. This book will cover type-driven development using the ReasonML language and explains how to put its type system to use in order to check that your code is logically consistent. We use types to express relationships and other assumptions directly in the code, and these assumptions are enforced by the ReasonML compiler before the code is run.</p>

<p>If you've ever wrestled with this problem: <em>Undefined is not a function</em>, then this book might be for you. If you're looking for a way to write less defensive code, fewer trivial tests, and not worry about breaking code if you try to refactor, then you may be interested in the concepts of type-driven development.</p>
<p>This book is for you if you are a programmer (it doesn't matter what kind) who's interested in writing safe, efficient code. There are many techniques and processes for achieving that, of course, but type-driven development is one of the most mainstream and accessible.</p>
<p>That being said, this book presents type-driven development using a relatively unfamiliar language. I've tried to write as plainly as possible; but to follow along, you'll still need to learn the rules and logic of a powerful type system. You will reach a point where your mind works in tandem with the compiler, but that will take time and patience. The reward will be that the compiler becomes your friend in writing safer and more correct code.</p>
<p>If you're willing to go on this journey and learn the rules of the type system, then this book is for you.</p>

<p><a href="1108f6f1-5f74-4a88-9baf-f55ec19aa007.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Starting Type-Driven Development</em><span><em>,</em> introduces type-driven development and its primary benefits. It gets you started with the ReasonML language and its tooling, it sets up a tutorial project that we will use throughout this book, and it shows where to go for further help and resources.<br/></span></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><a href="ff0971a6-9cf3-4680-8010-47acb7663764.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <span><em>Programming with Types and Values,</em> sets up an edit-compile workflow for fast development, and introduces a number of foundational concepts, such as types and values. It also covers how a static typing compiler works and how it is different from dynamic typing.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="5893dcee-7424-418e-9d33-7ac835ce724e.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <span><em>Packaging Types and Values Together,</em> shows how to write modular code and take advantage of Reason's first-class module support to achieve abstraction, information hiding, and API documentation.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="ba37505a-f222-4238-a13c-259160ca582d.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <span><em>Grouping Values Together in Types,</em> covers types that may contain multiple values of different types at once, the various ways to construct these product types, and how best to use them.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="d3723975-7a3c-4369-84fe-272b67870234.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <span><em>Putting Alternative Values in Types,</em> covers types that may contain only one value at a time of possibly many different types. We cover how these sum types are different from product types, and how and when to use them.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="2f7b2edf-b5f4-474b-b387-f48e1280b4b9.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <span><em>Making Types that Can Slot into Any Other Type,</em> covers generics, type parameters, how to make sum and product types generic, and the restrictions of working with generics.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="e6bacad6-b207-4689-b068-088bed455956.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <span><em>Making Types that Represent Operations,</em> covers functions and what their desirable properties are in type-driven development, how to create functions and how they work, and how to use them with achieve techniques such as dependency injection and inversion of control.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="d2652071-4cf6-41ae-99ac-40a1715d3cb1.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Reusing Code with Many Different Types</em><span><em>,</em> covers parametric polymorphism, a powerful technique in type-driven development for writing code that can be extended and reused without the old and new code having to know about each other's implementation details.<br/></span></p>
<p><a href="f624da01-5ccb-426f-8868-3e64c5565e38.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Extending Types with New Behavior,</em> covers techniques that can be used to improve code reuse and extend parts of an implementation<em>.<br/></em></p>
<p><a href="cecdfa1c-8143-4719-8241-1da47ad327ce.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Bringing It All Together</em><span><em>,</em> explains how to tie together many different techniques to explore an implementation when trying to solve a problem in a type-driven way.<br/></span></p>

<p>You should have experience with at least one programming language. It doesn't have to be JavaScript or ReasonML, even though we use these languages as examples of dynamic and statically-typed languages in this book.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>You should have a macOS, Linux, or Windows computer on which to install ReasonML and the associated software.</p>
<p>You should type in and compile (in some cases, run) the examples shown throughout the chapters. The examples have been designed to show the ideas covered, and deliberately trying out some of the negative examples shown in the chapters will be very instructive.</p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "Mount the downloaded <kbd>WebStorm-10*.dmg</kbd> disk image file as another disk in your system"<em>.</em></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre><span class="underline">let</span> <em>sumOfSquares</em>(<em>x</em>: <strong>int</strong>, <em>y</em>: <strong>int</strong>) = { /* (1) */<br/> <span class="underline">let</span> <em>xSq</em> = <em>x</em> * <em>x</em>;<br/> <span class="underline">let</span> <em>ySq</em> = <em>y</em> * <em>y</em>;<br/> <em>xSq</em> + <em>ySq</em><br/>};</pre>
<p>The code is <em>highlighted</em> as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Types are <strong>bolded</strong></li>
<li>Values are <em>slanted</em></li>
<li>Language-reserved words (keywords) are <span class="underline">underlined</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Also note that numbered comments are added to certain points in the code that need further explanation, for example:</p>
<ol>
<li>This note explains the code marked with the comment <kbd>/* (1) */</kbd></li>
</ol>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>$ mkdir css</strong><br/><strong>$ cd css</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see on screen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Select <span class="packt_screen">System info</span> from the <span class="packt_screen">Administration</span> panel".</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
