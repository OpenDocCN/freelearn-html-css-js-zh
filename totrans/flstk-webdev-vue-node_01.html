<p class="mce-root"><strong>Mongo, Express, Vue.js, and Node.js </strong>(<strong>MEVN</strong>) is a collection of JavaScript technologies just like <strong>MongoDB</strong>, <strong>Express</strong>, <strong>Angular</strong>, and <strong>Node.js</strong> (<strong>MEAN</strong>), and like<strong> </strong><strong>MongoDB</strong>,<strong> Express</strong>,<strong> React</strong>, and <strong>Node.js</strong> (<strong>MERN</strong>). It is a full-stack solution for building web-based applications that use MongoDB as data storage, Express.js as the backend framework (which is built on top of Node.js), Vue.js as the JavaScript framework for the frontend, and Node.js as the main engine for the backend.</p>
<p>This book is for web developers who are interested in learning to build a full-stack JavaScript application using MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, and Node.js. It is suitable for beginners and intermediate developers with a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The term MEVN may be new, but the technologies used in it are not new. The only new technology that is being introduced here is Vue.js. Vue.js is an open source JavaScript framework, and its popularity is growing rapidly. There's not much of a learning curve with Vue.js and it is also a fierce competitor of other JavaScript frameworks such as AngularJS and ReactJS.</p>
<p>Modern web applications need to be fast and easily scalable. In the past, JavaScript was used in web applications only when there was a need to add some visual effects or animations that normal HTML and CSS could not achieve. But today, JavaScript has changed. Today, JavaScript is used in almost every web-based application, from small- to large-scale apps. JavaScript is chosen when the application needs to be much faster and more interactive.</p>
<p>Building a full-stack application using JavaScript as the sole programming language has its own benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are just starting out and learning how to program, you only have to master one language: JavaScript. </li>
<li>Full-stack engineers are high in demand. Becoming a full-stack developer means that you have an idea of how databases work, you know how to build both the backend and the frontend, and you also have the skills for UI/UX.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>In this book, we will build the application using these technology stacks. </span></p>
<p>We will cover the following topics in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>An introduction to the MEVN technology <span>stack</span></li>
<li>An introduction to <span>Node.js</span> and its installation on Windows, Linux, and macOS</li>
<li>An overview of <kbd>npm</kbd> and its installation</li>
<li>An introduction to MongoDB and its installation and a few basic commands used in MongoDB</li>
<li>An introduction to GitHub version control and how it helps software engineers in terms of easy access to code history and collaboration</li>
</ul>

<p>JavaScript is one of the most important programming languages today. Founded by <span>Brendan Eich in 1995, it has done superbly well, not only in maintaining its status, but also in rising above all other programming languages.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root">The popularity of JavaScript is ever growing with no end in sight. Building web applications with JavaScript as the sole programming language has always been popular. And with this fast growing pace, the need for software engineers to have knowledge of JavaScript is only increasing. No matter what programming language you choose to excel at, JavaScript always crawls its way in to get involved with other programming languages as well, one way or the other.</p>
<p>There are a lot of technologies to choose from for the frontend and backend while developing an application. While this book uses Express.js for the backend, there are other frameworks as well, which you can learn if you want.</p>
<p>The other available backend frameworks are <strong>Meteor.js</strong>, <strong>Sails.js</strong>, <strong>Hapi.js</strong>, <strong>Mojito</strong>, <strong>Koa.js</strong>, and many others.</p>
<p>Similarly, for the frontend, the technologies include <strong>Vue.js</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Angular</strong>, <strong>Backbone</strong>, and many more.</p>
<p>For databases, the options, other than MongoDB, are <strong>MySQL</strong>, <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, <strong>Cassandra</strong>, and others.</p>

<p class="mce-root"><span>JavaScript frameworks are rising day by day, both in terms of numbers and their usage. JavaScript used to be implemented only for the client-side logic but, over the years, it has seen significant growth and now it is used both on frontends and backends.<br/></span></p>
<p>Express.js in the MEVN stack is used to manage all the backend-related stuff and Vue.js handles all the view-related stuff. The advantages of using an MEVN stack are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>One language is used throughout the whole application, which means the only language you need to know is JavaScript</li>
<li>Understanding the client side and server side is very easy with one language</li>
<li>Its very fast and reliable application with the non-blocking I/O of Node.js</li>
<li>Its a great way to keep updated on the growing ecosystem of JavaScript</li>
</ul>

<p>To get started, we need to add all the dependencies that are required for an MEVN stack application. We can also refer to the documentation on the official website (<a href="https://nodejs.org/">https://nodejs.org/</a>) for details on how to install Node.js in any operating system. </p>

<p>To install Node.js using the installer, perform the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install the installer: We can download the installer for macOS from the official website's download page (<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/#download">https://nodejs.org/en/#download</a>). We will be installing the latest <kbd>node</kbd> version, which is <kbd>10.0.0</kbd>. You can install any <kbd>node</kbd> version you want, but the application that we will be building in this book will require the <kbd>node</kbd> version <kbd>&gt;= 6.0.0</kbd>. Run the installer and follow the instructions given. When we download and run the installer, we will be prompted with the following dialog box:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/a6868792-7dc7-4c0f-b1b6-2c5ae9bcf818.png" style="width:38.67em;height:27.42em;"/></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Just hit <span class="packt_screen">Continue</span> until the installation finishes. Once the installation is complete, we will be able to see the following dialog box:</li>
</ol>

<p>Node.js can be easily installed using Homebrew in macOS. Homebrew is a free and open source software package manager that is used to install software on macOS. I personally prefer Homebrew because it makes it very easy to install different software on Mac:</p>
<ol>
<li>To<span> </span>install<span> </span><kbd>Homebrew</kbd>, type the following command:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"</strong></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Now, use <kbd>Homebrew</kbd> to install Node.js with the following command:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>$ brew install node</strong></pre>

<p><strong>NVM</strong> stands for <strong>Node Version Manager</strong>.<strong> </strong>NVM keeps track of all the <kbd>node</kbd> versions that we installed and also lets us switch between different versions. This is handy when the application that we built for one version of Node.js does not become compatible with the other versions, and we need that specific <kbd>node</kbd> version to make things work. NVM allows us to manage these versions easily. This is also very helpful when we need to upgrade or downgrade the <kbd>node</kbd> versions.</p>

<p>The npm is the acronym for <strong>Node Package Manager</strong>. Basically, it is a tool that takes care of all the packages that we install for Node.js. We can find all the existing packages on the official website (<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">https://www.npmjs.com/</a>). <kbd>npm</kbd> makes it easy for developers to keep their code updated and to reuse code shared by many other developers.</p>
<p>Developers are often confused by the terms package and modules. However, there is a clear distinction between these two.</p>

<p><kbd>npm</kbd> is used to install different packages in our application. There are two ways to install packages: locally and globally. When we want to install a certain package specific to our application, we want to install that package locally. However, if we want to use a certain package as a command-line tool or be able to access it outside our application as well, we will want to install it as a global package.</p>

<p>All the <kbd>node</kbd> packages and modules consist of a file called <kbd>package.json</kbd>. The main function of this file is to carry all the meta information associated with that package or module. A <kbd>package.json</kbd> file requires the content to be a JSON object.</p>
<p><span>As a minimum, a <kbd>package.json</kbd> file consists of the following things:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>name</strong>:<strong> </strong>The name of the package. This is an important part of a <kbd>package.json</kbd> file as it is the main thing that distinguishes it from other packages and, hence, it is a required field.</li>
<li><strong>version</strong>:<strong> </strong>The version of the package. This is also a required field. To be able to install our package, the <kbd>name</kbd> and <kbd>version</kbd> fields need to be given.</li>
<li><strong>description</strong>: A short summary of the package.</li>
<li><strong>main</strong>:<strong> </strong>This is the primary entry point used to look for the package. Basically, it is a file path, so when a user installs this package, it knows where to start looking for the modules.</li>
<li><strong>scripts</strong>:<strong> </strong>This field consists of commands that can be run for various states in the application. It has a key-value pair. The <kbd>key</kbd> is the event at which the command should be run and the <kbd>value</kbd> is the actual command.</li>
<li><strong>author/contributors</strong>: The author and contributors are the people. It contains an identifier of the person. An author is a single person, whereas contributors can be a group of people.</li>
<li><strong>license</strong>: The license field, when provided, makes it easy for the users to use our package. This helps in identifying the permissions and restrictions when using the package.<strong><br/></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>We can manually create a <kbd>package.json</kbd> file and specify the options ourselves, or we can use a command to create it interactively from the command prompt. </p>
<p>Let's go ahead and initialize a sample application with a <kbd>package.json</kbd> using <kbd>npm</kbd>.</p>
<p>First, create a folder in your projects directory using the command:</p>
<pre><strong>$ mkdir testproject</strong></pre>
<p>To create a <kbd>package.json</kbd> file, run the following command in the application that we created:</p>
<pre><strong>$ npm init</strong></pre>
<p>Running this command will ask us a bunch of questions that we can answer interactively from the command line:</p>

<p>In the end, it will create a <kbd>package.json</kbd> file, which will have the following content:</p>

<p>MongoDB is the first part of the technology in the MEVN stack. MongoDB is a free and open source document-based database published under a GNU license. <span>It is a NoSQL database, meaning it is a non-relational database</span>. <span>Unlike relational databases, which use tables and rows to represent data, MongoDB uses collections and documents.</span> <span>MongoDB represents the data as a collection of JSON documents. </span>It provides us with the flexibility to add fields in whatever way we want. Each document in a single collection can have a totally different structure. Aside from adding fields, it also provides the flexibility to change the fields from document to document in whatever way we want, something that is a cumbersome task in relational databases. </p>

<p>MongoDB offers a lot of benefits compared to Relational Database Management Systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Schema-less architecture: MongoDB does not require us to design a specific schema for its collections. A schema for one document can vary, with another document being totally different.</li>
<li>Each document is stored in a JSON-structured format.</li>
<li>Querying and Indexing the MongoDB is very easy.</li>
<li>MongoDB is a free and open source program.</li>
</ul>

<p>Installing MongoDB from the installer is as easy as installing any other software on Windows. Just like we did for Node.js, we can download the MongoDB installer for Windows from the official website (<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#atlas">https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#atlas</a>). This will download an executable file.</p>
<p>Once the executable file is downloaded, run the installer and follow the instructions. Just go through the dialog box, reading the instructions carefully. When the installation is complete, just click on the <span class="packt_screen">Close</span> button and you are done.</p>

<p>Let's dive a little deeper into MongoDB. As mentioned earlier as well, Mongo consists of a database with collections (tables/groups of data) and documents (rows/entries/records). We will use a few commands provided by MongoDB to create, update, and delete the documents:</p>
<p><span>First, start the Mongo server with this command:</span></p>
<pre><strong>$ mongod</strong></pre>
<p>Then, open the Mongo shell with this command:</p>
<pre><strong>$ mongo</strong></pre>

            <article>
                
<p>This is the place where we can see all of our databases, collections, and documents.<br/>
To display the list of databases that we have, we can use the following:</p>
<pre><strong>&gt; show dbs</strong></pre>
<p>Now, this command should list all the existing databases. To use the database that we want, we can simply run this command:</p>
<pre><strong>&gt; use &lt;database_name&gt;</strong></pre>
<p>But if there is no database listed, don't worry. MongoDB provides us with a functionality where, when we run the preceding command, even if that database does not exist, it will automatically create a database with the given name for us.</p>
<p>So, if we already have a database that we want to use, we simply run that command and, if there are no databases yet, we create one using this command:</p>
<pre><strong>&gt; use posts</strong></pre>
<p>When we run this command, a database named <kbd>posts</kbd> will be created.</p>

            <article>
                
<p><span>Now, let's quickly review the commands used in MongoDB. </span>The <kbd>insert</kbd> command is used to create new documents in a collection in MongoDB. Let's add a new record to the database that we just created called <kbd>posts</kbd>.</p>
<p>Here as well, in order to add a document to a collection, we first need a collection, which we don't have yet. But MongoDB allows us to create a collection easily by running the <kbd>insert</kbd> command. Again, if the collection exists, it will add the document to the given collection and, if the collection does not exist, it will simply create a new collection.</p>
<p>Now, in the Mongo shell, run the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>&gt; db.posts.insertOne({</strong><br/><strong>    title: 'MEVN',</strong><br/><strong>    description: 'Yet another Javascript full stack technology'</strong><br/><strong>});</strong></pre>
<p>The command will create a new collection called <kbd>posts</kbd> in the <kbd>posts</kbd> database. The output of this command is:</p>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-529 image-border" src="assets/b8a7bc64-056f-4843-ad70-fa136b03b44e.png" style="width:33.92em;height:9.83em;"/></div>
<p>It will return a JSON object that has the ID of the document that we just created in the <kbd>insertedId</kbd> key and a flag that the event was received as <kbd>acknowledged</kbd>.</p>

<p>This command is used when we want to fetch the records from a collection.  We can either fetch all the records or a specific document by passing parameters as well. We can add a few more documents to the <kbd>posts</kbd> database to better learn the command</p>

<p><span>This command is used when we want to update a certain part of a collection. Let's say we want to update the description of a post whose title is <kbd>Vue.js</kbd>; we can run the following command:</span></p>
<pre><strong>&gt; db.posts.updateOne(</strong><br/><strong>     { "title" : "MEVN" },</strong><br/><strong>     { $set: { "description" : "A frontend framework for Javascript programming language" } }</strong><br/><strong> )</strong></pre>

<p>We can see here that the <kbd>matchedCount</kbd> is <kbd>1</kbd>, which means that as regards the parameter that we sent to update the record with the title <kbd>MEVN</kbd>, there was one document in the <kbd>posts</kbd> collection that matched the query.</p>
<p>The other key called <kbd>modifiedCount</kbd> gives us the count of the documents that got updated.</p>

<p>GitHub is a version control service. It is a source code management tool specifically designed to track changes to our code. GitHub also provides features of social networking, such as adding comments, and displaying feeds, which makes it even more powerful because multiple developers can collaborate at the same time in a single application.</p>

<p>GitHub is a savior for software engineers. There are several advantages that GitHub provides that make it worthwhile to use. A few benefits that are provided by GitHub are listed here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tracking code changes</strong>: GitHub helps track changes to the code, which means it <span>maintains a history of our code. This enables us to view revisions of our code base made during any time period.</span></li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong>: GitHub provides features for adding documentation, Wikis, and so on to our code bases, and these can be written using the simple markdown language.</li>
<li><strong>Graphs and reporting</strong>: GitHub provides insight into various metrics, including how many additions and deletions were made to the code, who the top contributors were, and who has the most commits.</li>
<li><strong>Bug tracking</strong>: Since GitHub tracks all the activities made at every point in time, when something breaks, we can easily backtrack to the point that broke the code. We can also integrate third-party tools such as Travis for continuous integration, which helps us to track and identify bugs easily.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration is easy</strong>: Github tracks every activity done by every collaborator working on the project and also sends email notifications about the same. It also provides social media features, such as feeds, comments, emojis, and mentions.</li>
<li><strong>Hosting our own website</strong>: We can also host our own website with GitHub using a feature called GitHub pages. We just need to create a repo for our own project and host it using Github pages, which will then make the website applicable to the URL: <kbd>https://&lt;username&gt;.github.io</kbd>.</li>
</ul>

<p>GitHub is very easy to use. However, to get started using GitHub, we need to least know about a few terminologies that are used in GitHub:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Repository/Repo</strong>:  A repository is a place where all of our code bases are stored. A repository can be either private or public.<span><br/></span></li>
<li><strong>ssh-key</strong>:  ssh-key is a way to authorize in GitHub. It stores our identities.</li>
<li><strong>Branch</strong>:  A branch can be defined as multiple states of a repository. The primary branch of any repository is the <kbd>master</kbd> branch. Multiple users can work in parallel on different branches.<strong><br/></strong></li>
<li><strong>Commit</strong>:  A commit makes it easy to distinguish between different states of a file at a given time. When we make a commit, a unique identifier is assigned to that commit so what it's easy to check what changes were made in that commit. A commit takes a message as a parameter to describe the type of change that is being made.</li>
<li><strong>Push</strong>:  A push sends the commit that we made back to our repository.<strong><br/></strong></li>
<li><strong>Pull</strong>:  As opposed to pushing, pulling fetches the commit from the remote repository to our local project.<span><br/></span></li>
<li><strong>Merge</strong>:  Merging is basically done between multiple branches. It is used to apply changes from one branch to another.</li>
<li><strong>Pull requests</strong><span>:  </span><span><span>Creating a <kbd>pull request</kbd> is basically sending the changes that we made to our code base for the approval of other developers. We can start discussions on a <kbd>pull request</kbd> to check the quality of code and ensure that the changes don't break anything.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p>Now that we know the basics of GitHub, let's get started creating a GitHub repository for the project we want to build:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, create a folder for the application in the root folder. Let's name this application <kbd>blog</kbd>:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><span> <strong>$ mkdir blog</strong></span></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Create an account on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a>.</li>
<li>Go to your profile. Under the <span class="packt_screen">Repositories</span> tab, click <span class="packt_screen">New</span> as follows:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-534 image-border" src="assets/a167a04d-7d3a-48e7-a0f0-c5cb1553e087.png" style="width:46.83em;height:6.92em;"/></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Name this repository <kbd>blog</kbd>.</li>
<li>Now, on the Terminal, go to the location of this application and initialize an empty repository with this command:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong> $ cd blog<br/></strong><strong> $ git init</strong></pre>
<ol start="6">
<li>Now, let's create a file called <kbd>README.md</kbd> and write a description for the application and then save it:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong> $ echo 'Blog' &gt; README.md<br/></strong></pre>
<ol start="7">
<li>Add this file to GitHub:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong> $ git add README.md</strong></pre>
<ol start="8">
<li>Add a <kbd>commit</kbd> so that we have a history of this change of code:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong> $ git commit -m 'Initial Commit'</strong></pre>
<ol start="9">
<li>Now, to link the local application with the <kbd>remote</kbd> repository in GitHub, use this command:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>$ git remote add origin https://github.com/{github_username}/blog.git</strong></pre>
<ol start="10">
<li>Finally, we need to <kbd>push</kbd> this <kbd>commit</kbd> to GitHub:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong> $ git push -u origin master</strong></pre>
<p class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">When it's done, visit the GitHub repository where you will find a history of the commits made to our repository, as follows:</p>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/95a1bce9-e60d-484a-a21c-f435eb23d0fb.png"/></div>
<p>That's it. Now, when we want to write changes, we will first create a branch and push the changes to the branch.</p>
