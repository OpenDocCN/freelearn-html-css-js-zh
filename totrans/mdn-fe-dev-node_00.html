<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-5" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
<p lang="en-GB">This book covers everything necessary to make you use the power of Node.js, its concepts, and its ecosystem to the fullest. This includes everything you need to know about module systems, packages, helper libraries, CLI tools, WebAssembly, and a range of available tools such as bundlers (Webpack (v5), Parcel (v2), Vite, and esbuild), test runners (AVA, Jest, and Mocha), transpilers (Babel and TypeScript), and many more tools (Flow, Prettier, eslint, and Stylelint) are also covered.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-6" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p lang="en-GB">This book is for junior and intermediate-level frontend web developers who are looking to leverage the Node.js ecosystem for building frontend solutions. The book requires beginner-level knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Prior experience in using a standard shell (sh) will be beneficial.</p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-8" lang="en-GB"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
<p lang="en-GB">All the examples in the book have been created with simplicity in mind. They all work similarly and only require knowledge in core frontend technologies such as JavaScript with HTML and CSS. Additionally, some basic knowledge in using a terminal is necessary in order to follow all examples. The tooling to make the code run is discussed throughout the book. As such, if you know how to work with JavaScript, and follow the book explaining how to use Node.js with npm, you’ll have no problems running the examples presented in the book.</p>
