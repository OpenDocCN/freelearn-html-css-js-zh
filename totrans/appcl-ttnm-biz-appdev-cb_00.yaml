- en: The demand for mobile apps by business enterprises has never been greater. While
    meeting this demand is becoming increasingly business critical, the complexities
    of development are amplified by the explosion in devices and platforms. Mobile
    JavaScript frameworks have been available since the start of the smartphone revolution
    and is the perfect platform to meet these challenges. Recognizing the cross-platform
    nature of these frameworks, enterprises have begun to rely on them for building
    cost-effective yet compelling cross-platform solutions.
