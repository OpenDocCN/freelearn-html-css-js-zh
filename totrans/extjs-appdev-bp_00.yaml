- en: In times gone by, JavaScript was used to provide minor enhancements to the Web
    in order to decorate pages with amusing effects or to validate user input. Slowly
    but surely, as browsers implemented faster JavaScript engines and new features
    and as developers and engineers came up with new techniques and ideas, JavaScript
    became near-ubiquitous in providing the functionality that end users have come
    to expect. With Ext JS, you have a toolset that allows you to build advanced JavaScript
    applications, but with great power comes great responsibility.

    that client expectations are met, timescales are achieved, and costs are contained.
    While juggling these requirements, the architect must provide the foundations
    for a technically successful project consisting of high quality, understandable
    code.

    and practice of designing and building Ext JS applications. Over the next 11 chapters,
    you'll learn how Ext JS gives developers the key to a professionally designed
    software project and how to take this knowledge and use it in a range of real-world
    scenarios.

    as a team leader, or are simply looking to understand how to design and structure
    your applications, this book is for you. We won't stop and explain every little
