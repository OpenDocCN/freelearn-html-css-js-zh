<h1 class="chapterTitle" id="_idParaDest-310">Exploring Clip Studio Assets and Animations</h1>
<p class="normal">Two of the most exciting Clip Studio Paint features are Clip Studio Assets, which allows the fast and easy downloading of new brushes and other assets, and the ability to create animations in the program. In this chapter, we will explore both options and how to use them.</p>
<p class="normal">The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Clip Studio Assets</li>
<li class="bulletList">Creating an account and logging in</li>
<li class="bulletList">Downloading from Assets</li>
<li class="bulletList">Creating animations</li>
<li class="bulletList">Exporting animations</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">We will start this chapter by looking at what Clip Studio Assets is, then how to create an account and log in to Assets. Then, we are going to learn about the interface of Assets, and how to search for assets you want, even actually downloading a sample asset. We will move on to get to know ways to create an animation in Clip Studio Paint with two example steps, and finally, learn how to export the animation.</p>
<p class="normal">By the end of this chapter, you will have useful knowledge of how to get materials to use on your creations, and you’ll be able to start creating an animation using an image you have created!</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s jump right into these amazing features!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-311">Technical requirements</h1>
<p class="normal">To get started, you need Clip Studio Paint already installed on your device, and a canvas of 1280 x 720 px with 144 dpi with character art and background art in separate layers. You will also need a Clip Studio account to log in.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-312">Downloading from Assets</h1>
<p class="normal">Clip Studio Assets includes <a id="_idIndexMarker1339"/>user-created brushes, materials, 3D objects, sound effects, and more that can be downloaded for use in your own works.</p>
<p class="normal">In this section, we are going to learn how to use Clip Studio Assets by searching, downloading, and registering materials that are ready to be used!</p>
<p class="normal">To access the materials available for download, click on the nine-square icon at the top right of the <strong class="screenText">CLIP STUDIO START</strong> screen, and click on the <strong class="screenText">Search for materials - Assets</strong> link in the pop-up menu window. <em class="italic">Figure 18.1</em> shows the Assets library at the time of writing.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_18_18.1.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.1: Assets library</p>
<p class="normal">Each asset has a thumbnail showing us what the asset looks like. Beneath the thumbnail image, we have information about the asset. The first line tells us what type of asset it is (Pose, Workspace, Image material, Brush, and so on). The next line tells us<a id="_idIndexMarker1340"/> the name of the material. The third line tells us the username of the person who created and uploaded the asset to the online library. The next line tells us how many times that asset has been downloaded, and the final line tells us the cost of the asset.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Important note</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Many of the items in the Assets download library are free. However, some assets need special currencies such as Clippy or Gold. You can collect Clippy points by doing some activities on Clip Studio Assets such as uploading materials you made, but Gold costs money. In order to download priced assets, you first have to purchase Gold from Celsys. At the time of writing, 1,000 Gold costs around $10. Gold has an expiration date that is normally one year from the day of purchase, so if you purchase Gold, be sure to use it all before it expires!</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">To search for a specific asset, type a keyword or keywords into the <strong class="screenText">Search</strong> bar at the top of the Assets window. Press the <em class="italic">Enter</em> key on your keyboard to complete the search. The button marked <strong class="screenText">Filter</strong> to the right of the search bar can be clicked and then used to narrow the search results. For instance, in the following screenshot, we have entered the search keyword <strong class="screenText">Heart</strong>. If we only want to see Brush assets that match that keyword, click on the <strong class="screenText">Brush</strong> option under the <strong class="screenText">Filter</strong> window, as shown<a id="_idIndexMarker1341"/> in <em class="italic">Figure 18.2</em>. This will filter the search results accordingly.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_18_18.2.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.2: Search options</p>
<p class="normal">There is also a very useful way to pick good assets quickly, which is changing the order of displayed search results, as you can see from the three options in <em class="italic">Figure 18.3.</em></p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_18_18.3.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.3: Search result order options</p>
<p class="normal">You have the option to select <strong class="screenText">Newest first</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Oldest first</strong>, or <strong class="screenText">Popular</strong>. I recommend selecting <strong class="screenText">Popular</strong> because the most downloaded assets will be displayed first, which means they can be the most useful ones. If you are after very unique ones, then select <strong class="screenText">Newest first</strong> to see the latest assets. Some old assets can be elementary and not compatible with the latest version of Clip Studio Paint.</p>
<p class="normal">So, if you want to browse the most popular free heart-shaped brushes first, you can type <strong class="screenText">Heart</strong> in the search bar, hit <em class="italic">Enter</em> on your keyboard, select <strong class="screenText">Brush</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Free</strong> from the <strong class="screenText">Filter</strong> drop-down options, and then click the <strong class="screenText">Close</strong> button. Finally, click <strong class="screenText">Popular</strong> from<a id="_idIndexMarker1342"/> the display order options, and the assets most likely to meet your needs will be displayed at the top!</p>
<div><p class="normal">I<strong class="keyWord">mportant information</strong></p>
<p class="normal">As of 2024, Clip Studio Assets now auto-translates material names to English, French, German, Spanish, Korean, Traditional Chinese, or Japanese. When you click on a material, you will see the translated name and the original name in brackets. Materials also now have a unique content ID that users can enter in the search bar to find specific materials. If this doesn’t return what you’re looking for, then it may be up to you to make that asset and put it out there for others to download! This is a great way to show off your Clip Studio skills, and you can make a little extra money too if you create a paid asset that lots of people download.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Once we locate an asset that we might be interested in downloading, we can click on the thumbnail to view more details about it. The asset in <em class="italic">Figure 18.4</em> is <strong class="screenText">Retro Chip Brush</strong>, which looks pretty good.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_18_18.4.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.4: Retro Chip Brush asset details</p>
<p class="normal">From this detail<a id="_idIndexMarker1343"/> window, we can add a <strong class="screenText">Like!</strong> to the asset by clicking on the heart button (and we can see how many likes the asset has, too). We can add the asset to our favorites by clicking on the star-shaped button. Favorites can act as a sort of wish list of paid assets if you like.</p>
<p class="normal">Scrolling down further will give us more information about the asset we wish to download. Most users will include more thumbnails and ideas on how to use the asset in an image. Be sure to look at this information before deciding to download an asset.</p>
<p class="normal">The Retro Chip Brush asset is a paid asset, so we would need to have Gold in our account to download this brush. In <strong class="screenText">Free</strong> assets, we will see a <strong class="screenText">Download</strong> button at the top right of the screen. Clicking on the <strong class="screenText">Download</strong> button of a free asset, or the <strong class="screenText">Checkout Now</strong> button on paid assets, will allow you to download them.</p>
<p class="normal">Once you’ve started downloading an asset, click the gear-shaped <strong class="screenText">Settings</strong> icon, then select <strong class="screenText">Data Transfers</strong> to see the<a id="_idIndexMarker1344"/> status of your downloads, which is in <em class="italic">Figure 18.5.</em></p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_18_18.5.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.5: Data Transfers window</p>
<p class="normal">Any downloading and recently downloaded items will show in this window. We will see the name, content ID, and progress bar for a currently downloading item, the name, date, and time that the download occurred, the status of the download, and the status of the process, which shows whether the process was successful or not, for already downloaded items. Check this to make sure that the download was successful before trying to download the asset again.</p>
<p class="normal">Now that we have downloaded an asset, we need to locate it in the Material palette in Clip Studio <a id="_idIndexMarker1345"/>Paint.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-313">Locating your downloads in Clip Studio Paint</h2>
<p class="normal">When we download <a id="_idIndexMarker1346"/>an asset to Clip Studio Paint, it goes into our Material palette. To take a glance and edit your materials, click the <strong class="screenText">Manage Materials</strong> icon on the left-side menu of the <strong class="screenText">CLIP STUDIO START </strong>screen. You will see the list of materials with their thumbnails. In Clip Studio Paint, open the <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> palette and click the arrow next to the words <strong class="screenText">All materials</strong> if you can’t find the <strong class="screenText">Download</strong> category. If you click <strong class="screenText">Download</strong>, the most recent downloaded assets will be displayed on the right, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 18.6.</em></p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_18_18.6.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.6: Material palette</p>
<p class="normal">If the asset you downloaded was an image, pattern, or 3D asset, you will be able to use it right away from the Material palette. If it was a Brush asset, you still need to register that <a id="_idIndexMarker1347"/>asset to one of the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> palettes. This is a very simple process. To register the Brush material, follow these easy steps:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Open the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> palette to show the group of tools to which you wish to register the new Brush asset. We will be registering a new <strong class="screenText">Pen</strong> asset in this instruction.</li>
<li class="numberedList">In the <strong class="screenText">Download</strong> section of the Material palette, click on the thumbnail of the Brush asset you want to register to Sub Tool.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click and hold the thumbnail and maintain the pressure, then drag it to the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> palette without letting go of it. Once it comes over to the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> palette, you will see a <strong class="screenText">+</strong> symbol appear next to the asset you are dragging. Release the pressure now.</li>
<li class="numberedList">The new asset will be registered to the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> palette. In <em class="italic">Figure 18.7</em>, we can see that the brush from the previous screenshot is now in the <strong class="screenText">Pen Sub Tool</strong> category:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_18_18.7.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.7: Pen Sub Tool palette</p>
<p class="normal">Isn’t it fantastic to be able to access tons of materials that will help your creations? First, we started with the <strong class="screenText">CLIP STUDIO ASSETS</strong> screen to learn what it is for and what it offers. Then, we moved on to learn how to create an account and log in to use Assets, and how to search for asset materials. And finally, we learned how to download and register a Brush material. To be honest, I could spend all day searching and collecting fancy and useful materials because it’s so much fun and<a id="_idIndexMarker1348"/> inspiring.</p>
<p class="normal">In the next section, we will have a look at how to create animations in Clip Studio Paint. Read on to explore this great feature!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-314">Creating animations in Clip Studio Paint</h1>
<p class="normal">In this section, we<a id="_idIndexMarker1349"/> are going to learn how<a id="_idIndexMarker1350"/> to create animations using the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Timeline</strong> palettes in Clip Studio Paint with two examples.</p>
<p class="normal">Technically, the word <em class="italic">animation</em> comes from the Latin <em class="italic">animare</em>, which means “to give life to.” Nowadays, it is another way of saying “moving image.” It is a very complex art form that requires lots of study and practice to get it right. There are many books and internet resources, such as <em class="italic">The Animator’s Survival Kit: A Manual of Methods, Principles and Formulas for Classical, Computer, Games, Stop Motion and Internet Animators</em>, written by Richard Williams, or the <em class="italic">12 Principles of Animation</em> video by AlanBeckerTutorials on Youtube. They will inspire you with content about how to animate, the principles of animation, and tips for animating well. These things may be beyond the scope of this book. However, we can explore how to create a Clip Studio file with an animation timeline and then add animation cels to make our pictures have the appearance of motion. Once you are used to the basics of animating, I encourage you to check out these resources and refine your skills. Meanwhile, I just want to teach you how to create a basic animation – how to create an animation timeline and how to add animation cels.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Important note</strong></p>
<p class="normal">When working in Clip Studio Paint Pro, your animation frames are limited to only 24 in a timeline. Clip Studio Paint EX can create unlimited animation frames in a timeline.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">We will learn<a id="_idIndexMarker1351"/> two<a id="_idIndexMarker1352"/> different ways of creating animations from your art. One is by using an image and the other is by using the camera movement feature.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-315">Creating an animation using one image</h2>
<p class="normal">You can either start <a id="_idIndexMarker1353"/>a new file just for <a id="_idIndexMarker1354"/>animation or add animation to an existing piece of artwork. In this section, we will use your existing artwork. Follow these steps to create your first animation:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">First, create a canvas of <strong class="keyWord">1280 x 720</strong> <strong class="keyWord">px</strong> at <strong class="keyWord">144 dpi</strong>. You need your artwork to have character and background drawings in separate layers, as in <em class="italic">Figure 18.8</em>:</li>

<li class="numberedList">In the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu, click <strong class="screenText">Animation</strong>, then <strong class="screenText">New animation layer</strong>, and finally, <strong class="screenText">Animation folder</strong> to create an animation folder named <strong class="screenText">Folder 1 : 0</strong> in the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 18.11.</em></li>

<p class="normal">Isn’t it great to<a id="_idIndexMarker1371"/> see your art now has some<a id="_idIndexMarker1372"/> motion? Before we find out how to export the animation, let’s learn just one more way of creating an animation.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-316">Creating an animation using one image with the Camera Movement feature</h2>
<p class="normal">There are<a id="_idIndexMarker1373"/> animations<a id="_idIndexMarker1374"/> that you can create by moving the camera position rather than the characters. We need to add something called keyframes, which indicate from which timepoint to start adding an effect such as camera movement, and the timepoint for it to end. Follow these steps to create an animation using the camera movement feature:</p>

<p class="normal">You have finished creating an animation using the camera movement feature! Let’s check that it really works by clicking the <strong class="screenText">Play</strong> icon.</p>
<p class="normal">When the animation is played in a loop, it shows the characters growing bigger and then smaller as if they are about to pop out from the background, as shown in the following<a id="_idIndexMarker1385"/> screenshot<a id="_idIndexMarker1386"/> of the frames:</p>

<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">You can create animation images in one folder, but when doing more complex animation, such as characters moving and interacting with one another, you may have more success by roughing out the animation in one animation folder and then refining the motion in another folder. This way, the original sketches are preserved, and you can adjust anything as needed. This is similar to traditional animation: roughing out the motion in pencil sketches and then painting the finished animation onto transparent celluloids.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">You have now created two types of animation: one using one art image and drawing elements you want to move in new layers and the other using the camera<a id="_idIndexMarker1387"/> movement <a id="_idIndexMarker1388"/>feature by adding keyframes.</p>
<p class="normal">It’s time to export <a id="_idIndexMarker1389"/>those animations to share them with others – read on to find out how.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-317">Exporting animations</h1>
<p class="normal">Just like when we <a id="_idIndexMarker1390"/>exported our still images, we can export our animations too. This is a simple process, but there are several formats for export that we need to explore in order to know which is the correct one to choose for our purposes.</p>
<p class="normal">In this section, we are going to have a look at each method of exporting animations.</p>
<p class="normal">In the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu, you will see the <strong class="screenText">Export animation</strong> option, and under that option are the different ways we can export animations. These are shown in <em class="italic">Figure 18.30.</em></p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_18_18.30.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.30: Export animation options</p>
<p class="normal">We will discuss<a id="_idIndexMarker1391"/> each of these options next.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-318">Image sequences</h2>
<p class="normal">An image sequence <a id="_idIndexMarker1392"/>is a series of still <a id="_idIndexMarker1393"/>images. Each animation image is exported as a numbered image that can then be imported into other software for further editing. The <strong class="screenText">Image sequence export settings</strong> window is shown here:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_18_18.31.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.31: Image sequence export settings window</p>
<p class="normal">The top part is a <a id="_idIndexMarker1394"/>drop-down menu for <strong class="screenText">Preset</strong> exporting<a id="_idIndexMarker1395"/> information. You can create, edit, and import this information. The text entered in the <strong class="screenText">Name</strong> field will be the filename for each image. The character entered in the <strong class="screenText">Separator</strong> field will separate the name from the numbers in the final filenames. By changing the entry for <strong class="screenText">Start number</strong>, we can adjust what number our image sequence will begin with.</p>
<p class="normal">Under <strong class="screenText">Advanced Settings</strong>, we can set the file format of the images from the drop-down menu. You are also given the choice of either exporting a draft image sequence or already-created frames by checking the corresponding boxes.</p>
<p class="normal"><strong class="screenText">Size Settings</strong> can be used to select how big a <strong class="screenText">Drawing area</strong> you want to export: either <strong class="screenText">Output frame</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Overflow frame</strong>, or <strong class="screenText">Entire canvas</strong>. We can also resize the exported image’s <strong class="screenText">Width</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Height</strong> by setting the values on <strong class="screenText">Output image</strong>. You can also check the <strong class="screenText">Apply 2D camera effects</strong> box if you want to export a camera movement that you created with an image sequence.</p>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Frame export</strong> settings can be used to specify a section of frames to export, or all frames <a id="_idIndexMarker1396"/>can<a id="_idIndexMarker1397"/> be exported. The <strong class="screenText">Frame rate</strong> option can be used to change the frame rate.</p>
<p class="normal">Read on to the next exporting option, <strong class="screenText">Animated GIFs</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-319">Animated GIFs</h2>
<p class="normal">An animated GIF is <a id="_idIndexMarker1398"/>one of the most common ways to share <a id="_idIndexMarker1399"/>animation on the internet. You’ve undoubtedly seen animated GIFs on countless websites and social media posts as internet memes. To export your animation as a GIF, select the <strong class="screenText">Animated GIF…</strong> option from the <strong class="screenText">Export animation</strong> menu option.</p>
<p class="normal">First, name the file to be saved. Then, the <strong class="screenText">Animated GIF export settings</strong> will appear, as shown in<em class="italic"> Figure 18.32</em>.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_18_18.32.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.32: Animated GIF export dialog box</p>
<p class="normal">There is no other choice in the drop-down menu. Click on <strong class="screenText">OK</strong> and a new window pops up for you to edit the export settings, as shown here:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a video editor  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_18_18.33.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.33: Animated GIF export settings dialog box</p>
<p class="normal">There are<a id="_idIndexMarker1400"/> boxes<a id="_idIndexMarker1401"/> in which you can enter the <strong class="screenText">Width</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Height</strong> values of the frame; generally, 720 x 480 for a lower resolution, 960 x 540 for a medium resolution, and 1280 x 720 would be considered a high-resolution animation. Under that option, we can set how many frames to export, the frame rate, and how many times to loop the animation. The standard frame rate for animated videos is often 24 frames per second (fps), but it can vary depending on the style. For a GIF animation, 8 fps is good to go. At the bottom of the screen, there are two options. You can turn <strong class="screenText">Dithering</strong> on to make the GIF look more naturally higher quality, and there is also a checkbox if you want to <strong class="screenText">make the background transparent</strong>. When you press <strong class="screenText">OK</strong>, a save location window will pop up. Navigate to the location you want to export the animated GIF to. Mac and PC versions of Clip Studio Paint might skip the dialog box and go straight to the <strong class="screenText">Export location</strong> dialog box.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s see the<a id="_idIndexMarker1402"/> next <a id="_idIndexMarker1403"/>exporting option, <strong class="screenText">Animated sticker</strong> (<strong class="screenText">APNG</strong>)!</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-320">Animated stickers (APNG)</h2>
<p class="normal">An animated <a id="_idIndexMarker1404"/>sticker, or APNG, is an animated image <a id="_idIndexMarker1405"/>with the qualities of a <strong class="screenText">.png</strong> file instead of a <strong class="screenText">.gif</strong> file, often used for animated stickers in messaging apps. The APNG export options are shown in <em class="italic">Figure 18.34</em>.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_18_18.34.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.34: Animated Sticker (APNG) export dialog box</p>
<p class="normal">These options are the same as the <strong class="screenText">.gif</strong> options; there are no other options on the drop-down menu. Again, this dialog box might be skipped on the Mac and PC versions of Clip Studio Paint and you might see the Export settings dialog box similar to the Animated GIF export setting straight away, then the <strong class="screenText">Export location</strong> dialog box.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s look at the last exporting option, <strong class="screenText">Movie…</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-321">Movie files</h2>
<p class="normal">Movie files can be<a id="_idIndexMarker1406"/> uploaded to YouTube or imported into video <a id="_idIndexMarker1407"/>editing software to add sound or other effects. When you select the <strong class="screenText">Movie…</strong> option, you will be prompted to add a filename and select a file type, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 18.35</em>.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_18_18.35.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.35: Movie export dialog box</p>
<p class="normal">As a point of interest, the MP4 file type is much lighter and is used more widely on platforms than<a id="_idIndexMarker1408"/> the QuickTime Movie file type, but QuickTime Movie beats MP4 for image and audio quality. Once you add a file name, select the file type, and then click <strong class="screenText">OK</strong>, the following window will appear:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_18_18.36.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 18.36: Movie export settings window</p>
<p class="normal">At the top of the window, we have <strong class="screenText">Scaling settings</strong>. By using the <strong class="screenText">Width</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Height</strong> settings, we can resize the dimensions of our final file. If you check the box labeled <strong class="screenText">Apply 2D camera effects</strong>, a camera movement you have created will be exported too. The <strong class="screenText">Frame rate</strong> option controls the frame rate of playback.</p>
<p class="normal">Now you know<a id="_idIndexMarker1409"/> how to use Clip Studio Assets and quick ways to start<a id="_idIndexMarker1410"/> creating animations and then export them from Clip Studio Paint!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-322">Summary</h1>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we started by getting to know what Clip Studio Assets is, and how to register to log in to start using it. We moved on to learn about ways to search for our desired materials, then download them, and finally, register a brush material. Then, we had a quick look at how to bring life to our illustrations with animation using two different methods, and different ways to export them for different uses. Now you can download and use new assets, and create and export animations for GIFs, stickers, and YouTube movies!</p>
<p class="normal">In the next chapter, we are going to learn how to export, print, and upload your manga. You can get a better idea of what a finished manga will look like, and also a deeper understanding of how to set up pages as seen in <em class="italic">Chapter 5</em>, <em class="italic">Pages and Panels to Shape Manga</em>, if you read it again. We will discuss the many ways we can export our work for display on the web and in print. With physical manga books or webtoons, you will see the many possibilities for how to present your creations.</p>
