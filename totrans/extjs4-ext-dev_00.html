When developing an application, we mostly look for the best support for the functionality and components that offer the framework. But we almost always face the situation when the framework does not have the specific functionality or component that we need. Fortunately, Ext JS has a powerful class system that makes it easy to extend an existing functionality or component, or to build new functionalities or components.</p><p>In this book, we start by providing a very clear concept of Ext JS plugins and extensions with examples, going through several Ext JS libraries and community-provided plugins and extensions and several hands-on developments of real-life, useful Ext JS plugins and extensions.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Labeled Spinner">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Labeled Spinner</em>, goes through hands-on development of an Ext JS extension called Labeled spinner field. This chapter shows how we can extend the Ext.form.field.Spinner class, and add functionality so that this extension can show a configurable label beside the value within the spinner field and some more advanced features.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Chart Downloader">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Chart Downloader</em>, goes through hands-on development of an Ext JS plugin, which will help to download a chart as an image.

<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Grid Search">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Grid Search</em>, goes through hands-on development of an Ext JS plugin, which will provide a search facility within a grid. This plugin was originally developed by Ing. Jozef Sakáloš and is a very useful and popular plugin. In this chapter, this plugin will be re-written for the Ext JS 4x Version.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Input Field with Clear Button">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Input Field with ClearButton</em>, goes through hands-on development of Stephen Friedrich's ClearButton plugin. This plugin is targeted for the text components that show a "clear" button over the text field. When the clear button is clicked, the text field is set to empty.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Message Bar">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Message Bar</em>, goes through hands-on development of an Ext JS extension, which will be a fancy animated message bar. The message bar will provide the facility of having a configurable duration timer for showing the message, a close button, and also be able to customize the look, and can provide optional icons for different types of states such as valid or invalid, or information during runtime.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Intuitive Multiselect Combobox">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Intuitive Multi-select Combobox</em>, explores an excellent Ext JS extension, BoxSelect, which was originally developed by Kevin Vaughan.
