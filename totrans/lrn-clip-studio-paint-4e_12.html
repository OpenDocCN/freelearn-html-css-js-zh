<h1 class="chapterTitle" id="_idParaDest-211">Making Layer Masks and Screentones</h1>
<p class="normal">In traditional painting, you might use masking tape to cover up the parts of the piece that you shouldn’t touch, so that you can go crazy with your brush. There is a similar function in digital drawing, too! The layer mask is an extremely useful feature in digital art that has many applications. Thanks to the function, we can concentrate on drawing without caring too much about pen strokes going over boundaries.</p>
<p class="normal">We will also look at screentones; they are used less and less in modern printing but are still quite popular in black-and-white manga printing because they have their own beauty. You can use screentones together with a layer mask to create a nice shading effect for your manga art.</p>
<p class="normal">We are also going to learn about using screentones with clipping layers, which have a different masking effect from layer masks.</p>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we will learn about the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">What is a layer mask?</li>
<li class="bulletList">Using a layer mask</li>
<li class="bulletList">Adding screentones</li>
<li class="bulletList">Using a clipping layer</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">By the end of this chapter, you will know more about the benefits of digital drawing. You will be able to work on each part of a drawing tactically by using layer masks, screentones, and clipping layers.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s dive right in!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-212">Technical requirements</h1>
<p class="normal">To get started, you need Clip Studio Paint installed on your device and a new canvas open with a white paper layer and a layer with any art. Any size is fine, but I recommend creating a 300 dpi square canvas to go through the content in this chapter.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-213">What is a layer mask?</h1>
<p class="normal">A layer mask is a feature<a id="_idIndexMarker920"/> of digital art that allows parts of a layer to be hidden without being erased for good. This allows us to fine-tune a drawing or part of a drawing without losing what has already been done. Layer masks can be adjusted over and over, hiding parts of a drawing and then being removed again to bring those parts back.</p>
<p class="normal">A good way to think about a layer mask is as being like a Halloween mask. Putting a mask on your face conceals your real face. Take the mask off, and your face is visible again.</p>
<p class="normal">Unlike the case when using eraser tools, layer masks are not permanent and allow changes to be made without losing any data. We can see what a character looks like with a different hairstyle or temporarily hide parts of a background, for example. The best thing is that layer masks are easy to use and edit! In the next section, we will see how to use a layer mask.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-214">Using a layer mask</h1>
<p class="normal">In order to make a <a id="_idIndexMarker921"/>layer mask, you will need a canvas open with one layer and some sort of content on it. This could be a sketch, an ink drawing, a photo, or anything else you desire, so long as there is some sort of content to mask out so that we can see how the layer mask works.</p>
<p class="normal">Follow these steps to create a layer mask and hide and restore content:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Select the layer to add the mask to by clicking on it in the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on the <strong class="screenText">create layer mask</strong> icon in the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette. This icon is shown by the arrow in <em class="italic">Figure 12.1</em>.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_12_12.1.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 12.1: Layer palette</p>
<p class="normal-one">A new thumbnail will appear to the right of the layer thumbnail in the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette. This is the layer mask. When the layer mask is selected, a secondary outline will appear around the layer mask thumbnail. <em class="italic">Figure 12.2</em> shows a piece of art and a corresponding layer of the skirt color with a selected layer mask:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_12_12.2.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 12.2: Image and the Layer palette with a layer mask</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="3">To hide the<a id="_idIndexMarker922"/> content on the layer, select the <strong class="screenText">Eraser</strong> sub-tool. Erase the section of the layer that needs to be hidden. The masked area will show up in the layer thumbnail as blacked-out space. We can use this function to erase more skirt colors without losing them permanently. Because the masked area is still there, it can be unmasked at any time. We can use this great function to show elements on other layers better, but when we change the layout of the art, we can reveal the masked part again, so we don’t need to redraw that part of the art all over again! <em class="italic">Figure 12.3</em> shows the black area where the skirt color layer has been masked.</li>
</ol>

<li class="numberedList" value="4">To make masked content visible again, select any pen or brush tool. Draw over the masked area again with the tool to show the masked content.</li>
</ol>
<p class="numberedList"><em class="italic">Figure 12.4</em> shows that the middle of the masked area has been shown again because the area inside of the black mask is white again.</p>

<p class="normal">If you are having <a id="_idIndexMarker923"/>trouble editing a layer mask or the layer that a mask is attached to, double-check the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette to ensure that the layer mask or the layer is selected before moving on to other troubleshooting. Sometimes, the layer can be selected instead of the layer mask, or vice versa, which can have undesired results.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Want a part of your drawing to have a ghostly or faded look? Use the <strong class="screenText">Soft Eraser</strong> or <strong class="screenText">Airbrush</strong> tool with the translucent color on a layer mask to fade out the edges of the drawing. To select the translucent color, click the checkerboard pattern square underneath the two squares that show the currently selected foreground and background colors at the bottom of the Clip Studio Paint interface. By using the translucent color, you can turn any drawing tool into an eraser.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Isn’t it a big relief to know that there is a way to hide some part of a piece of art without erasing it, in case you need the hidden part again later in the process of creating your art? You don’t need to worry at all, even if it’s not visible at the moment; the masked part is always there and can be recovered when you want it back by either deactivating the layer mask or deleting it. Something is only ever masked temporarily!</p>
<p class="normal"><em class="italic">Figure 12.5</em><a id="_idIndexMarker924"/> shows brilliant ways of using layer masks, like adding color correction layers, such as <strong class="screenText">Multiply</strong> or <strong class="screenText">Overlay</strong>, only on a character drawing, hiding parts of a hand fan/sword/gun/umbrella under a holding hand, and changing a hairstyle.</p>

<p class="normal">Let’s look at a<a id="_idIndexMarker925"/> different way of hiding parts of an artwork!</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-215">Creating quick masks using selection tools</h2>
<p class="normal">Layer masks <a id="_idIndexMarker926"/>can be created quickly by using the <strong class="screenText">selection</strong> tools to select the areas of the drawing we want to hide and then adding the mask using active selection.</p>
<p class="normal">We covered a multitude of ways to make selections in <em class="italic">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="italic">Erasers, Selections, and the Sub View Palette</em>, so if you need a refresher on making selections, now is a great time to go back and review that chapter before continuing with using a selection to make a quick layer mask.</p>
<p class="normal">Once you’ve familiarized yourself with the <strong class="screenText">selection</strong> tools, follow these steps to create a layer mask quickly:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">First, make a selection using one of the <strong class="screenText">selection</strong> tools. In <em class="italic">Figure 12.6</em>, the lasso marquee tool has been used to make a selection around the character’s ribbon on the ribbon color layer.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_12_12.6.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 12.6: Image with a selected area</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="2">In the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu, click <a id="_idIndexMarker927"/>on <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong>, then navigate to <strong class="screenText">Layer Mask</strong> and click on <strong class="screenText">Mask Selection</strong>. This path is shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12.7</em>.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_12_12.7.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 12.7: Layer drop-down menu</p>
<p class="normal-one">Using this method, the area inside the selection will be masked but everything outside of the selection will be visible. In <em class="italic">Figure 12.8</em>, the <a id="_idIndexMarker928"/>selected colored part on the ribbon is now hidden by the layer mask.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_12_12.8.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 12.8: Image with a masked area</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="3">To mask everything<a id="_idIndexMarker929"/> outside of the selection, in the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu, click on <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong>, then navigate to <strong class="screenText">Layer Mask</strong> and click on <strong class="screenText">Mask Outside Selection</strong>. In <em class="italic">Figure 12.9</em>, all clothing color is gone except the end of the character’s ribbon, because it was inside of the selection and so has not been masked.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_12_12.9.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 12.9: Image with a masked area (continued)</p>
<p class="normal">Make any necessary edits to the mask, such as adding more masked parts using the erasing tool and an unmasked back with the pen or brush tool, as detailed in the <em class="italic">Using a layer mask</em> section <a id="_idIndexMarker930"/>of this chapter.</p>
<p class="normal"><strong class="screenText">The Mask Outside Selection</strong> option works well when we want to hide the majority of the content but leave a tiny, complicated shape hidden, such as a clothing pattern on only a part of clothing –the very end of the skirt perhaps, or ribbons. Of course, we can add shade or lighting to a limited area in the same way.</p>
<p class="normal">If you want to deactivate the mask temporarily, click on the <strong class="screenText">Mask</strong> drop-down menu in the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette and uncheck the box next to the <strong class="screenText">Enable Mask</strong> option icon to deselect it, as you can see in <em class="italic">Figure 12.10</em>.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_12_12.10.png"/></figure>

A mask will automatically be generated for the outside of the selection.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Using the selection tools allows us to make masks more quickly and easily. Rather than having to go over large areas with the eraser tools, instead, we can make a simple selection and create a layer mask for that selection with the click of a button. What a time-saver!</p>
<p class="normal">We have been looking at how to use layer masks using erasers and selection tools. Now, let’s<a id="_idIndexMarker932"/> move on to find out about screentones and how we can use them with a layer mask!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-216">Adding screentones</h1>
<p class="normal">We’re looking into how to use <a id="_idIndexMarker933"/>screentones with a layer mask to control shades of black and white for a manga.</p>
<p class="normal">In the old days, printers could only print black ink writing and drawings on paper. This meant that older printed illustrations didn’t have gray tones. Artists had to draw detailed dots and line patterns using black ink in order to express gray tones for printing. But it’s time consuming to do that! To make the process faster, people invented screentones.</p>
<p class="normal">Screentones, or halftones, are made of a pattern of dots that provide shading. Back in the days before digital art, these tones would be printed on a big sheet of sticky-backed plastic. Artists would apply this large, clear sticker over their art and then carefully use a sharp knife to cut out the areas that didn’t need tone on them and peel away the excess. The downsides to this method were that you had to keep buying new screentone sheets and that, sometimes, a careless stroke would cut through your original artwork and ruin it!</p>
<p class="normal">But now, we can mimic these patterns of dots digitally. And, thanks to layer masks, we can simply mask out the areas that don’t need to be shaded without doing any damage to the screentone pattern or our original sketch. This makes the screentone process easier and less stressful than it used to be!</p>
<p class="normal"><em class="italic">Figure 12.12</em> is an example of using digital screentones. Note that the shadows are created using<a id="_idIndexMarker934"/> a pattern of circles that provide depth for the image.</p>

When dealing with a tiny area you need to add screentones to, there’s a quick way to select and add screen tones, which we will cover in later sections.</p>
<p class="normal">But for now, are <a id="_idIndexMarker937"/>you wondering what the meaning of each screentone’s name is? Let’s find out more about that in the next section.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-217">Lines and percentages in screentone names</h2>
<p class="normal">Before we <a id="_idIndexMarker938"/>continue with our next method for adding tone to images, let’s take a moment to understand the terminology used for the screentone names. </p>
<p class="normal"><em class="italic">Figure 12.17</em> shows two of the tone materials in the palette.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_12_12.17.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 12.17: Types of screentones</p>
<p class="normal">Beneath each<a id="_idIndexMarker939"/> tone material is the name of the tone. We can break these names into four parts. Each of these parts of the name is detailed as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1"><strong class="screenText">Screen frequency</strong>: This is the number at the very beginning of each filename, appearing before <em class="italic">LPI</em> (line per inch). For example, in the first material in the figure on the left, the number for the screen frequency is <strong class="screenText">65.0</strong>. This number refers to how many lines of the pattern are repeated in a set area. Much like DPI, the larger this number is, the smaller the overall shapes in the tone pattern will be. Compare the <strong class="screenText">65.0</strong> thumbnail to the <strong class="screenText">32.5</strong> one and note how much larger the circles are in the <strong class="screenText">32.5</strong> example. The larger the number at the beginning of the material name, the smaller the dot pattern will be.</li>
<li class="numberedList"><strong class="screenText">Density</strong>: This part of the name refers to the number with the percent sign shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12.17</em>. Density controls how dark the created shadow will appear to be. For example, a density of 10% would be a very light shadow, made of very small dots in the screentone pattern. However, a density of 95% would be made of very large black dots that might only have very small white gaps in the pattern because of the overlap. A density of 100% would be pure black. 50% density will provide a medium shadow in the completed artwork.</li>
<li class="numberedList"><strong class="screenText">Type</strong>: This refers to the shape that the pattern is created from. Most commonly, screentones are made of solid circles. However, we can make tone<a id="_idIndexMarker940"/> patterns from many different shapes and symbols, as we will see in a later section. Each of the tones in the preceding figure uses the <strong class="screenText">Circle</strong> type.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="4"><strong class="screenText">Gradient style</strong>: The tones in the preceding figure are of the <strong class="screenText">Monochrome</strong> variety because they are located in the <strong class="screenText">Dot</strong> screentone folder. This means that the tone has only one density and one screen frequency level throughout the entire tone. However, if we look in the <strong class="screenText">Gradient</strong> folder instead of the <strong class="screenText">Dot</strong> folder, we will find tones that have <strong class="screenText">Linear</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Circular</strong> gradients that fade from dark to light and back again in a pattern. These specialty tones can be used for effects or to get soft shading. In <em class="italic">Figure 12.18</em>, the gradient <strong class="screenText">60.0 LPI / 50% Circle Monochrome</strong> was used to add the shading effect, and we can see the control handles, which means we can move and change the size of the circle.</li>
</ol><figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_12_12.18.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 12.18: Illustration with a Gradient screentone</p>
<p class="normal">Now that we<a id="_idIndexMarker941"/> know a bit more about the terminology of screentones, let’s look at the fastest way to apply tones in Clip Studio Paint: the simple tone options.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-218">Creating simple tones using selections</h2>
<p class="normal">We can make a<a id="_idIndexMarker942"/> selection and then fill that selection with a customized tone, instead of using one that is already in the <strong class="screenText">Material </strong>palette.</p>
<p class="normal">The following steps show how to add a screentone to a selection. You will need to have an open file ready to follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Use the selection tool of your choice to make a selection.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Beneath the active selection in the command bar, click on the <strong class="screenText">new tone</strong> icon. This is shown with an arrow pointing at it in <em class="italic">Figure 12.19</em>.</li>

<li class="numberedList" value="3">Choose the desired settings from the <strong class="screenText">Simple tone settings</strong> dialog box that will appear. Note that the <strong class="screenText">Frequency</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Density</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Type</strong> properties that we addressed earlier are also used in this dialog box’s options. We<a id="_idIndexMarker943"/> can also adjust the angle of how the pattern is applied.</li>

</div>
<p class="normal">I hope that you have started to understand more about how to handle screentones. Let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker944"/>look at the variations for the shapes that create patterns of screentones!</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-219">Simple tone options</h2>
<p class="normal">Let’s talk for a<a id="_idIndexMarker945"/> moment about the different options available under the <strong class="screenText">Type</strong> drop-down menu in the <strong class="screenText">Simple tone settings</strong> dialog box. This allows us to choose shapes other than simple circles. These shapes include hearts, stars, asterisks, and flowers, among others. They can be used to create special effects in certain scenes, or just to provide a variety of tones. In <em class="italic">Figure 12.21</em>, the star shape has been made with the <strong class="screenText">Star</strong> screentone.</p>

<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Size</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Factor</strong> options<a id="_idIndexMarker946"/> in the <strong class="screenText">Simple tone settings</strong> dialog box are only available when using the <strong class="screenText">Noise</strong> option under the <strong class="screenText">Type</strong> option. Using the <strong class="screenText">Noise</strong> option makes the stars distort randomly; <em class="italic">Figure 12.22</em> is an example of the <strong class="screenText">Noise</strong> screentone.</p>

<p class="normal">You can now select, paste, and <a id="_idIndexMarker947"/>edit screentones by using a selection tool, a layer mask, the <strong class="screenText">Material </strong>palette, and the <strong class="screenText">Simple tone settings</strong> dialog box!</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-220">Creating screentones using Layer Property</h2>
<p class="normal">There is also <a id="_idIndexMarker948"/>another incredibly easy way to <a id="_idIndexMarker949"/>add screentones to your art! With just one click on the <strong class="screenText">Layer Property</strong> option, your drawing gets a screentone.</p>
<p class="normal">Follow these steps to learn how to do it:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Open a canvas that already contains some inking art. Create a new raster layer underneath, then use any drawing tool with any light-colored ink to fill in an area where you want to add a screentone.</li>

<li class="numberedList" value="4">But wait – the<a id="_idIndexMarker952"/> screentone<a id="_idIndexMarker953"/> now covers part of the character’s jacket, which had a dark gray color but looks lighter now.

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 12.25: Density drop-down options</p>
<p class="normal">The jacket area is now shaded much better because the screentone’s density has been adjusted for the brightness of the colors already on the canvas.</p>
<p class="normal">Alternatively, we<a id="_idIndexMarker954"/> can <a id="_idIndexMarker955"/>change the screentone layer’s blending mode from <strong class="screenText">Normal</strong> to <strong class="screenText">Multiply</strong>. You can find out more about layer blending modes in the <em class="italic">Exploring layer blending modes</em> section in <em class="italic">Chapter 16, Using Clip Studio Paint to Color Your Manga.</em></p>
<p class="normal">If you follow the same steps but fill an area with a dark color instead of a light one, the resultant screentone will be dense and dark, too!</p>
<p class="normal">When you use screentones incorrectly, your art can look bad, with the screentone shading for a character breaching the character’s outline and intruding on the background. How can we fix this easily? Wouldn’t it take too much time to adjust the screentones using eraser and pen tools here and there so that we don’t go over the boundaries when we want screentones to stay inside the character’s outline?</p>
<p class="normal">There is a good function to know for adding screentones to art right up to a boundary and no further. It is called the clipping layer function. It makes your shading <a id="_idIndexMarker956"/>very <a id="_idIndexMarker957"/>accurate! We’ll look into this in the next section.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-221">Using the clipping layer function</h1>
<p class="normal">It’s great to know<a id="_idIndexMarker958"/> that there is a clipping layer function for digital drawing when you are shading. A clipping layer is a layer that clips to the layer below it, only showing the contents of the top layer in places where the bottom layer has pixels filled in. It comes in handy when you want to add shading only inside a colored area.</p>
<p class="normal">I guarantee that you will find this feature very useful once you try it by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Open your canvas and create a new raster layer with any inked art. Choose a light gray color from the <strong class="screenText">Color</strong> palette and then use the <strong class="screenText">Fill</strong> tool to fill with color any area that is enclosed by outlines.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Create a new raster layer <em class="italic">on top of the layer</em>, then use the <strong class="screenText">Soft Airbrush</strong> tool with any dark color to paint an area where you want to add a screentone. Do not worry, as the color won’t stay in the gray area; just add variations of thin and thick colors, something like <em class="italic">Figure 12.26</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 12.26: Airbrushed area</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="3">You can do <a id="_idIndexMarker959"/>this step from the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu, too, but I’ll show you the easiest way to create screentones from the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette (in just one click). Make sure the layer with the airbrushed color is selected, go to the <strong class="screenText">Layer Property</strong> palette, and click the <strong class="screenText">screentones</strong> icon in the <strong class="screenText">Effect</strong> options, shown with an arrow in <em class="italic">Figure 12.27</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 12.27: Layer Property options</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="4">As you can see in<a id="_idIndexMarker960"/> <em class="italic">Figure 12.27</em>, the airbrushed area has now turned into screentones. Click on the <strong class="screenText">clip to layer below</strong> icon in the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette, which is pointed to by a white arrow in <em class="italic">Figure 12.28</em>.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="5">Once it’s <a id="_idIndexMarker961"/>activated, the icon is highlighted in blue, and a pink line appears next to the clip layer thumbnail, as you can see in the figure on the left. The image now has screentones only on the gray area of the character’s jacket, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 12.29</em>.</li>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 12.29: Clipped screentones</p>
<p class="normal">Using clip layers, you<a id="_idIndexMarker962"/> can combine screentones and grayscale in some clever ways! You don’t have to spend a lot of time using brush and eraser tools to make adjustments around the boundary edges to make sure your screentones neatly sit inside them.</p>
<p class="normal">In <em class="italic">Figure 12.30</em>, we have used screentones over flat gray fills to add more dimensions to the comic panel.</p>

<p class="normal">The clipping layer function is one of the huge advantages of digital drawing; you can use it with<a id="_idIndexMarker963"/> patterns, colors, shades, and screentones. Also, of course, you can use it in combination with a layer mask. You can activate it, deactivate it, and modify content anytime you want!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-222">Summary</h1>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we learned what a layer mask is and how to create one. We also learned how to make a layer mask using selection tools to save time. We then learned about the benefits of using layer masks in comparison with eraser tools. We also used screentone materials and created simple tones by using selections and layer masks. </p>
<p class="normal">To finish off the chapter, we learned how to use a clipping layer to combine screentones with grayscale.</p>
<p class="normal">In the next chapter, we are going to learn all about the ruler tools that make Clip Studio Paint a truly powerful piece of art software. You won’t worry about creating accurate angles and perspectives anymore. Keep reading to learn more!</p>
