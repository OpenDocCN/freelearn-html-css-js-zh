<a id="id1" class="indexterm"/> is a complete process, which goes through distinct phases to automate test cases for applications under the test.

Selecting the right tool is winning half the battle. An appropriate tool helps in speeding up script creation, modification, identifying the issues in scripts, and resolving them quickly; in a nutshell, it makes life much easier for the test automation team.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec10"/>Treating test automation as a development activity</h3></div></div></div><p>Treat test automation with the same discipline and objectivity as a development project. A successful<a id="id80" class="indexterm"/> testing automation project takes a framework-driven approach. Decompose the scripts based on the AUT functionality and divide them into reusable functions. Create a well-defined structure that allows uniform sharing of resources. Prepare appropriate <a id="id81" class="indexterm"/>documentation: one that enhances the readability and maintainability. Ensure that the scripting/coding standards have been followed. Finally, you need to test and debug the scripts or code and make sure that the scripts are free from bugs. It is also good to check whether the scripts and resources use version control tools or mechanisms.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec11"/>Getting the right architecture</h3></div></div></div><p>It is difficult to extend and<a id="id82" class="indexterm"/> maintain the test automation if the framework-driven approach is not used. The overall design becomes chaotic or cumbersome to modify or enhance. The test automation framework allows us to define the scripting methodology to automate tests, create support libraries and common resources to execute the tests, and report the results. Framework allows adding the test cases with minimal effort. It also allows the establishing of a<a id="id83" class="indexterm"/> common standard and consistent way to achieve goals for the automation team.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec12"/>Ensuring relevant and up-to-date test data</h3></div></div></div><p>If data is outdated and irrelevant, the test automation suite might not be able to catch bugs. The near-production data (the data which is most similar to production data) ensures that the test data is <a id="id84" class="indexterm"/>mapped to the correct fields in the GUI.<a id="id85" class="indexterm"/> It should not contain leading and trailing spaces. Use test data with the correct spelling, since it may be relevant for selecting values from the drop-down menu, for example choosing data wisely for reuse across multiple tests. Test data is helpful in enhancing the code coverage. After a certain period the test data might become irrelevant; thus, it should be replaced by relevant and up-to-date test data to find bugs quickly and easily.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec13"/>Investing in team building and training</h3></div></div></div><p>Apart from the right<a id="id86" class="indexterm"/> tools and a well-laid process, a testing automation project requires a dedicated and skilled team to understand the complexity of the project and <a id="id87" class="indexterm"/>translate it into scripts. The gaps in the skillset imbalances the work and delivery, leading to patchwork and low morale of the team members. The leads or managers should see that the team gets adequate training to bridge the gaps (if any) in the skillset.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec14"/>Conducting reviews and tests</h3></div></div></div><p>Without formal reviews,<a id="id88" class="indexterm"/> it is likely that defects are not discovered <a id="id89" class="indexterm"/>and standards are not followed, leading to potential issues in the integration of framework components.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec09"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>The automation life cycle is a structured approach to design, execute, and maintain test automation. This structured approach is necessary to help steer the test team away from common test program/automation mistakes.</p><p>This chapter covered all the aspects of test automation in a broader perspective. Having knowledge of the automation life cycle and key activities in each phase helps in streamlining tasks and goals. Well-defined processes and historical data are helpful in test estimation, and tool evaluation and selection. The architecture or design is based on implementing the test automation and achieving goals. In the next chapter, we will discuss the various features of QTP and concepts that are essential to create reusable scripts.</p></div></body></html>
