			<p>Knowing what tools and apps to use can speed up your development process significantly. That is why we need to prepare our development environment first before typing lines of code. The development environment should make you feel comfortable and help you throughout the process of learning and writing your microservices.</p>
			<p>It is like building a house. Choosing the right tools can speed up the process and save you time. Of course, having the right tools doesn’t mean you will succeed, but it is better to fail with the right ones than to have the cause of failure be the choice of tools.</p>
			<p>This chapter focuses on installing the required tools. The programming language and frameworks are also tools for us to build microservices. In one form or another, everything we use while writing software is a tool for us. It makes no sense to install all the tools we plan to use at this point, but at least understanding how to install most of them will help us to switch to coding faster.</p>
			<p>We will also have a look at some of the Node.js frameworks that we plan to use in this book. Understanding them is crucial for fast and easy development.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we’re going to cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Node.js and its installation</li>
				<li>Node.js frameworks</li>
				<li>Choosing the right IDE</li>
				<li>Understanding and installing Docker</li>
				<li>Understanding and installing Apache Kafka</li>
				<li>Understanding and installing Git</li>
				<li>Installing Postman</li>
				<li>Installing MongoDB</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>To follow along with this chapter, you only need a browser of your choice and an internet connection. Regarding the rest of the tools we plan to use, we will learn how to install them in this chapter.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>Node.js and its installation</h1>
			<p>As we learned in the previous <a id="_idIndexMarker225"/>chapter, Node.js is a runtime environment built on Google’s V8 engine. You can build a wide variety of applications using it:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Web applications</strong>: Node.js is<a id="_idIndexMarker226"/> a popular choice for building<a id="_idIndexMarker227"/> both the backend and frontend of web applications. Its JavaScript-based environment makes it easy for developers to work on both sides.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Real-time applications</strong>: Node.js’s<a id="_idIndexMarker228"/> event-driven architecture and non-blocking I/O model make it ideal for building real-time applications such as chat apps, collaboration tools, and streaming services. These applications require constant communication between users and the server, and Node.js can handle this efficiently.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Single-page applications</strong> (<strong class="bold">SPAs</strong>): SPAs <a id="_idIndexMarker229"/>are web applications that load a single HTML page and update the content dynamically using JavaScript. Node.js can be used to build the backend API that provides data to the SPA client-side code.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">API-driven applications</strong>: Many <a id="_idIndexMarker230"/>modern applications rely<a id="_idIndexMarker231"/> on <strong class="bold">application programming interfaces</strong> (<strong class="bold">APIs</strong>) to access data and functionality from other services. Node.js is a great choice for building these APIs due to its ability to handle many concurrent requests efficiently.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Microservices</strong>: Node.js is well-suited <a id="_idIndexMarker232"/>for building microservices because of its modular nature and asynchronous capabilities.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Command-line tools</strong>: Node.js can<a id="_idIndexMarker233"/> be used to create command-line tools that automate tasks or interact with other systems.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Desktop applications</strong>: While less common, Node.js can also be used to build desktop applications <a id="_idIndexMarker234"/>with<a id="_idIndexMarker235"/> frameworks such as Electron.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Of course, this is not the full list, but it gives you a good idea of the wide range of applications that can be built with Node.js.</p>
			<p>Learning some<a id="_idIndexMarker236"/> technology or language mostly starts with installing the required tools. The same applies to Node.js. So, let’s dive into its installation process.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/>Installing Node.js for Windows</h2>
			<p>You might be <a id="_idIndexMarker237"/>surprised but I’m a big fan of Microsoft and its <a id="_idIndexMarker238"/>products. This means I’m using a Windows <strong class="bold">operating system</strong> (<strong class="bold">OS</strong>). All <a id="_idIndexMarker239"/>types of installations will be explained using mainly the <em class="italic">Windows OS,</em> but I will provide the relevant links to help non-Windows users be on the same level of progress.</p>
			<p>When installing Node.js from the official page (<a href="http://www.nodejs.org">www.nodejs.org</a>), it automatically detects your OS and provides the exact OS instructions to install it.</p>
			<p>We also have different ways of installing Node.js, even for the same OS. The most popular ones are prebuilt installers and installation via package manager.</p>
			<p>Let’s follow these step-by-step instructions to install Node.js:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to <a href="http://www.nodejs.org/en/download">www.nodejs.org/en/download</a>. In my case, I’ll be using Windows-based instructions.</li>
				<li>Select <strong class="bold">prebuilt installer</strong>.</li>
				<li>From the tab, select the required version of Node.js, along with the OS and CPU architecture to run it (<em class="italic">Figure 4</em><em class="italic">.1</em>).<p class="list-inset">You might be wondering which version of Node.js to choose – <strong class="bold">LTS</strong> or <strong class="bold">Current</strong>? Well, the answer is easy:</p><ul><li>For long-term use, where things need to stay stable and work well together, the <strong class="bold">LTS</strong> version is a safe bet. It’s a reliable option.</li><li>On the other hand, the <strong class="bold">Current</strong> version has all the latest bells and whistles, which is great for programmers who want to try out new features.</li></ul><p class="list-inset">For our code examples, the LTS version is sufficient. Select it and continue.</p></li>

Depending on the selected version, the version on the button will automatically be updated. We’ll look at this installation in depth in the next section.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">When installing, just accept the license and follow the wizard’s instructions without any custom setup configuration. In the middle of the installation, the wizard will require you to select how the app will behave when compiling native modules.

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor061"/>Installing Node.js for macOS and Linux</h2>
			<p>One of the<a id="_idIndexMarker249"/> easiest<a id="_idIndexMarker250"/> options for <a id="_idIndexMarker251"/>macOS and Linux users is to use a package-manager-based installation. Select your OS and go to the <strong class="bold">Package Manager</strong> section. From the <strong class="bold">using</strong> section, you can select the active management tool (<em class="italic">NVM</em>, <em class="italic">Brew</em>, <em class="italic">Chocolatey</em>, or <em class="italic">Docker</em>) and follow the instructions provided in that window (<em class="italic">Figure 4</em><em class="italic">.6</em>):</p>

			<p>While Node.js is <a id="_idIndexMarker252"/>our <a id="_idIndexMarker253"/>primary tool<a id="_idIndexMarker254"/> while developing microservices, throughout the learning process, we will also use some of Node.js’s frameworks to make our lives easier. The most popular ones that we’ll use in this book are <em class="italic">NestJS</em> and <em class="italic">Express.js</em>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>Node.js frameworks</h1>
			<p>Node.js has a lot of<a id="_idIndexMarker255"/> interesting frameworks. We’ll be using <em class="italic">NestJS</em> and <em class="italic">Express.js</em> (we look at more on these frameworks shortly) but of course, more frameworks rely on Node.js, and it is impossible to use all of them in a single book and even if possible, it doesn’t make too much sense to do it.</p>
			<p>First things first, Node.js is not a framework but a runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside the browser. Some developers call it a framework but that is not true. We need to understand the term framework to understand whether something is a framework or not. In programming, a <strong class="bold">framework</strong> is essentially a pre-built structure that serves as a foundation for creating software applications. It’s like a blueprint that you can customize to fit your specific needs, rather than having to start entirely from scratch. Frameworks come with pre-written code for common functionalities, such as handling user input, database interactions, or security. These components act as building blocks that you can leverage to save time and effort.</p>
			<p>Frameworks often have a defined way of organizing your code, which ensures consistency and makes it easier for other developers to understand and maintain the code base.</p>
			<p>A key aspect of frameworks is an <em class="italic">inversion of control</em>. Instead of your code calling into the framework, the framework calls your code at specific points. This allows the framework to manage the overall flow of the application.</p>
			<p>With that information, you can tell Node.js is not a framework. It is just a runtime, but we have frameworks that are built on <em class="italic">top</em> of Node.js. The most popular ones are <em class="italic">NestJS</em>, <em class="italic">Express.js</em>, <em class="italic">MeteorJS</em>, and <em class="italic">SailsJS</em>. Oh, by the way – many popular frameworks, such as <em class="italic">Sails</em>, <em class="italic">NestJS</em>, <em class="italic">Kraken</em>, <em class="italic">poet</em>, and <em class="italic">Item API</em>, are built on Express. As mentioned <a id="_idIndexMarker256"/>previously, we’ll be using NestJS and Express.js, so let’s look at them closely.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-62"><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>Express.js</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Express.js</strong> simplifies the <a id="_idIndexMarker257"/>web development process. By using<a id="_idIndexMarker258"/> Express.js effectively, you can create dynamic and interactive web experiences for your users. Because Express.js is lightweight, it’s a great choice for creating web applications that need to perform well under heavy traffic. One of the key features of Express.js is its ability to handle different routes, which are essentially paths users take to access specific parts of your web application.</p>
			<p>Imagine Node.js as the building blocks and tools, like bricks and mortar. Express.js is like prefabricated walls and plumbing – it gives you a structured way to assemble those blocks to create a web application faster. Building a complex web application with just Node.js can get messy. Express.js provides a framework so that you can organize your code into routes, middleware, and views, making it more maintainable and easier for others to understand.</p>
			<p>While you can build everything from scratch with Node.js, Express.js offers built-in features for handling routes, handling HTTP requests and responses, and creating APIs, saving you time and effort.</p>
			<p>Express.js is a popular framework with a vast community of developers. This means you have access to a wealth of resources, tutorials, and additional libraries to streamline development. While there are other Node.js frameworks available, Express.js is a strong choice due to its <a id="_idIndexMarker259"/>simplicity, flexibility, and large community <a id="_idIndexMarker260"/>support.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-63"><a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>NestJS</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">NestJS</strong> is a framework <a id="_idIndexMarker261"/>built on top of Node.js that is specifically useful <a id="_idIndexMarker262"/>for building robust and scalable server-side applications.</p>
			<p>NestJS enforces a clear and organized architecture for your application. This makes complex projects easier to manage and maintain, especially for teams of developers. It integrates seamlessly with TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing for improved code reliability and fewer errors. It also promotes a modular approach, where you break down your application into smaller, reusable components. This makes your code base more organized and easier to scale as your application grows.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Another piece of good news is that if you’re familiar with <em class="italic">Angular</em>, a popular frontend framework that NestJS borrows many concepts, it makes it easier to learn and use for Angular developers.</p>
			<p>NestJS goes beyond basic web applications. You can build RESTful APIs, GraphQL APIs, WebSockets applications, and even command-line interfaces using this framework.</p>
			<p>It also <a id="_idIndexMarker263"/>utilizes <strong class="bold">dependency injection</strong>, a powerful technique for managing dependencies between different parts of your application. This promotes loose coupling and makes your code more testable.</p>
			<p>Long story short, NestJS provides a structured and feature-rich toolkit on top of Node.js, allowing you to build scalable and maintainable server-side applications efficiently.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>Choosing between Express.js and Node.js</h2>
			<p>This book is <a id="_idIndexMarker264"/>not about Node.js <a id="_idIndexMarker265"/>frameworks, and our aim is not to provide full information about them. However, having fundamental knowledge about the differences between these two will help us to have a broader understanding. Let’s outline some situations where either of these frameworks would be a good fit. With this understanding, you’ll be able to make a more informed decision and pick the right framework for your project:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Use Express.js in the </strong><strong class="bold">following situations</strong>:<ul><li>If your project is small or medium-sized. For simpler web applications or APIs, Express.js’s lightweight and flexible nature might be ideal.</li><li>If you prioritize flexibility. Express.js offers more control over your application’s structure, allowing you to tailor it to your specific needs.</li><li>If you’re familiar with JavaScript. If you’re comfortable with vanilla JavaScript, the learning curve for Express.js is gentler.</li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Use NestJS in the </strong><strong class="bold">following situations</strong>:<ul><li>If your project is large or complex. NestJS’s structured architecture and features are beneficial for managing and maintaining bigger applications with multiple developers.</li><li>If you value scalability. NestJS’s modular design makes it easier to scale your application as it grows in terms of features and complexity.</li><li>If you want built-in features. NestJS offers features such as dependency injection and support for TypeScript out of the box, improving code maintainability and reliability.</li><li>If your team is familiar with Angular. If your developers have experience with Angular, NestJS’s <a id="_idIndexMarker266"/>similar <a id="_idIndexMarker267"/>structure can ease the learning curve.</li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>After installing Node.js, we need to prepare our <strong class="bold">integrated development environment</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDE</strong>) for development.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-65"><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>Choosing the right IDE</h1>
			<p>Choosing the right<a id="_idIndexMarker268"/> IDE may help you do fast development. For Node.js development, especially to follow our code examples, we don’t have strict requirements related to IDE. You can use your favorite text editor or built-in text editor for your OS. Choosing the right IDE is a taste and functionality preference. An IDE helps you in syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and refactoring, and also easily interacts with important libraries. You can use different IDEs, such as <em class="italic">Visual Studio Code</em>, <em class="italic">Eclipse Che</em>, <em class="italic">Sublime Text</em>, <em class="italic">WebStorm</em>, and <em class="italic">IntelliJ IDEA</em>.</p>
			<p>We prefer Visual Studio Code because it is free, easy to use, can be extended using extensions, is cross-platform compatible, easily configurable, and supports multiple programming languages.</p>
			<p>Let’s install Visual Studio Code. To install it, just follow these instructions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">https://code.visualstudio.com/download</a>.</li>
				<li>Click on your OS version and wait for the download to be completed.</li>
				<li>Click on the file you’ve downloaded and follow the default instructions.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>As you learn microservices <a id="_idIndexMarker269"/>development, you’ll become familiar with the classical application installation process. For that reason, we haven’t provided detailed screenshots and won’t be spending too much time on installation details. For more information, you can simply search for the relevant application installation instructions on Google.</p>
			<p>Visual Studio Code provides a rich extension library for all needs (<em class="italic">Figure 4</em><em class="italic">.7</em>). You can download anything you want to help you do fast development, refactor, highlight your code, and more:</p>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.7: Visual Studio Code’s EXTENSIONS section</p>
			<p>After installing our IDE, it is time to install Docker. It is a must-have tool, especially nowadays for <a id="_idIndexMarker270"/>microservice application development. We’ll be actively using Docker in our development, so let’s dive in.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-66"><a id="_idTextAnchor067"/>Understanding and installing Docker</h1>
			<p>Before installing <a id="_idIndexMarker271"/>Docker, we need to understand its value and purpose.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Docker</strong> is like a shipping container for your software. It packages everything your application needs to run – the code, libraries, and settings – and bundles them together. This ensures your application runs everywhere, in any OS without any issues. It guarantees that if the application works locally, it will work globally.</p>
			<p>Docker guarantees your application runs exactly how you built it, every time. No more surprises due to different computer setups.</p>
			<p>The main concepts in Docker are images and containers. <strong class="bold">Containers</strong> are <a id="_idIndexMarker272"/>lightweight and start up quickly, making testing and development cycles much smoother. You can simply ship the Docker container to any environment, cloud-based or not, and be confident it will work. Containers share the underlying OS, so you can run more applications on a single machine without bogging it down.</p>
			<p>In the world of Docker, an <strong class="bold">image</strong> is like a blueprint for a Docker container. It’s a set of instructions that specify what goes inside the container, including the software, libraries, and configurations needed for your application to run. You build an image once, and you can use it to create many containers, saving you time and effort. Images can be shared and downloaded easily, allowing you to run your application on any machine with Docker. One of the advantages of images is that everyone using the same image gets the same environment, reducing surprises and ensuring reliable application behavior.</p>
			<p>If you don’t want to install some applications to your computer <em class="italic">forever</em> and easily remove them after development is done, it would be better to not directly install them but use Docker for your installation.</p>
			<p>In the end, Docker simplifies the process of building, shipping, and running applications. It’s like having a<a id="_idIndexMarker273"/> universal box for your software, ensuring it runs flawlessly wherever it goes.</p>
			<p>That’s enough theory – let’s dive into the Docker installation process.</p>
			<p>You can install Docker for almost all popular OSs, such as Windows, Linux, and Mac. It may have specific requirements for your OS, which you can learn about by navigating to <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/">https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/</a>. Then, you can select your OS to install it.</p>
			<p>Note that requirements may vary by the OS’s internal version. In the <strong class="bold">System requirements</strong> section, you’ll see prerequisites based on the internal version of the selected OS (<em class="italic">Figure 4</em><em class="italic">.8</em>). For instance, for Windows, we have <strong class="bold">WSL 2 backend</strong> and <strong class="bold">Hyper-V backend and Windows containers</strong> system requirements:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 4.8: Docker’s System requirements section" src="img/B09148_04_8.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.8: Docker’s System requirements section</p>
			<p>If your OS meets the provided <a id="_idIndexMarker274"/>system requirements, you’ll be able to install Docker Desktop (<em class="italic">Figure 4</em><em class="italic">.8</em>). For Windows, <strong class="bold">WSL 2</strong> is recommended over <strong class="bold">Hyper-V</strong>.</p>
			<p>The installation is a straightforward process and doesn’t require any additional configuration:</p>

			<p>Docker is not the only powerful tool that we need to use when building microservices. We have another<a id="_idIndexMarker275"/> great tool that helps us have real-time communication between our microservices: Apache Kafka.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-67"><a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>Understanding and installing Apache Kafka</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Apache Kafka</strong> is an<a id="_idIndexMarker276"/> open-source platform that handles real-time data streams. Originally designed as a messaging queue, it has evolved into a robust system for streaming data and building event-driven architectures. Communication between microservices is crucial, and that’s where Kafka shines.</p>
			<p>Kafka itself is a huge concept that needs a different book. In this book, we’re going to provide enough information that we’ll be able to integrate and use it for our microservices. For more detailed information, you can follow my <em class="italic">Apache Kafka for Distributed Systems</em> course on the Udemy platform (<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/apache-kafka-for-distributed-systems/">https://www.udemy.com/course/apache-kafka-for-distributed-systems/</a>).</p>
			<p>Kafka uses a <strong class="bold">publish-subscribe</strong> messaging model. Services, acting as producers, publish events to specific channels <a id="_idIndexMarker277"/>known as <strong class="bold">topics</strong> within Kafka. Other services, functioning as consumers, subscribe to relevant topics and receive these events asynchronously.</p>
			<p>This approach beautifully decouples services from one another. Producers don’t need to wait for consumers to be available, and consumers can process events at their own pace. This improves scalability and flexibility.</p>
			<p>Kafka also acts as a buffer, storing events until consumers are ready. This enables asynchronous processing, which prevents bottlenecks and improves overall system responsiveness.</p>
			<p>Kafka is built for reliability. It replicates data across multiple nodes, ensuring that messages aren’t lost even if a server fails. This enhances fault tolerance within the microservices architecture.</p>
			<p>It’s important to know that Kafka scales horizontally. You can easily add more nodes to handle increasing data volumes without impacting existing services. This caters perfectly to the dynamic nature of microservices.</p>
			<p>As mentioned previously, a key feature of Kafka is its ability to handle real-time data streams. This is valuable for microservices that need to react to events promptly, such as in fraud detection or stock trading applications.</p>
			<p>Kafka is flexibly related to programming languages and integrates seamlessly with various programming languages, making it adaptable to diverse microservice environments.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Kafka Streams</strong>, a powerful<a id="_idIndexMarker278"/> API within Kafka, empowers you to perform real-time computations and transformations on data streams within the Kafka cluster itself. This stream processing capability adds significant value to microservice architectures.</p>
			<p>Long story short, by integrating Apache Kafka, microservice development benefits from increased scalability, resilience, and agility. It fosters a loosely coupled, event-driven approach that empowers microservices to communicate and react to changes effectively. This translates to a more robust, adaptable, and high-performing application architecture.</p>
			<p>Apache Kafka’s installation varies by OS, and you need some additional configuration per OS.</p>
			<p>Also, along with Apache <a id="_idIndexMarker279"/>Kafka, we may use Zookeeper and Kafka UI. Starting from Apache Kafka <code>v4</code>, you won’t need Zookeeper. However, this feature is still in development, so it makes sense to understand it also. Zookeeper has multiple responsibilities and plays a critical role as the coordinator.</p>
			<p>Kafka itself is a CLI-based tool, so if you want to see things graphically, you’ll need additional tools, such as Kafka UI, Offset Explorer, and more.</p>
			<p>But I have good news for you. If you have Docker installed, there is no need to dive into the details of the installation process. We can create a <code>docker-compose</code> file to combine the required tools and install them together. You can download files one by one, but <code>docker-compose</code> helps you to create a special YAML file where you can define all the tools and application dependencies and install them together. Here is our <code>docker-compose</code> file’s content:</p>

			<p>Now, we are ready <a id="_idIndexMarker281"/>to move forward and understand how to install Git, an essential tool under a developer’s belt.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-68"><a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>Understanding and installing Git</h1>
			<p>Git is a powerful <strong class="bold">version control system</strong> (<strong class="bold">VCS</strong>) for <a id="_idIndexMarker282"/>software<a id="_idIndexMarker283"/> development. Imagine it as a time machine for your code. It tracks every change you make to your project, like a detailed logbook.</p>
			<p>With Git, you can easily revert to a previous version of your code, essentially undoing any errors.</p>
			<p>It makes collaboration easy. Working with a team? Git lets everyone collaborate seamlessly. Each team member can work on their part of the project, and Git helps merge their changes smoothly, avoiding conflicts.</p>
			<p>It also keeps a detailed history of all the changes, allowing you to see exactly what modifications were made and by whom. This is crucial for tracking progress and understanding the project’s journey.</p>
			<p>Git is one of the most important tools that we use in our day-to-day development process. You can install Git for any popular OS, particularly for Linux, Windows, and Mac:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>For more detailed instructions for <em class="italic">Linux</em>, go to <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/linux">https://git-scm.com/download/linux</a>. There, you can find a Linux-distribution-based installation for Git.</li>
				<li>As with other popular tools, we have multiple options to install Git on <em class="italic">macOS</em>. Go to <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/mac">https://git-scm.com/download/mac</a> to learn more about it.</li>
				<li>For <em class="italic">Windows</em>, I prefer to use the <strong class="bold">Git for Windows</strong> tool. You can download it from <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/">https://gitforwindows.org/</a>. This application provides Git Bash and Git GUI mechanisms (<em class="italic">Figure 4</em><em class="italic">.11</em>). You can use any of them throughout your development:</li>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.11: Git for Windows</p>
			<p>There’s another<a id="_idIndexMarker284"/> tool we need to install. Let’s continue our installation journey with Postman.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-69"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>Installing Postman</h1>
			<p>The penultimate <a id="_idIndexMarker285"/>tool we’ll cover in this chapter is Postman. We’ll build a lot of APIs, and we need some tools to rapidly and easily test them. It’s a tool that helps developers interact with and test APIs.</p>
			<p>Here’s what Postman helps you do:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Build APIs</strong>: You can design and plan out your API using Postman’s tools.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Test APIs</strong>: Send requests (such as asking for information) and see the responses (the information you get back) from the API. This helps ensure the API works as expected.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Work with APIs</strong>: Postman lets you easily send different kinds of requests to APIs and see the results. It’s like having a remote control for the API.</li>
			</ul>
			<p> Here’s how you can install it:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to <a href="https://www.postman.com/downloads/">https://www.postman.com/downloads/</a>.</li>
				<li>Click on your OS’s name and download the relevant file.</li>
				<li>Install it.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>After installing <a id="_idIndexMarker286"/>Postman, open it. At this point, you can insert any URL into the URL section. There, you can also select the HTTP method (<code>GET</code>, <code>POST</code>, <code>PUT</code>, and so on) for that URL and send the request (<em class="italic">Figure 4</em><em class="italic">.12</em>):</p>

			<p>With that, let’s move<a id="_idIndexMarker287"/> on to the final tool in this chapter: MongoDB.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-70"><a id="_idTextAnchor071"/>Installing MongoDB</h1>
			<p>MongoDB is a popular <a id="_idIndexMarker288"/>NoSQL database. We will use it when we develop microservices and it might be a good choice for you in the future when you build microservices.</p>
			<p>You may consider MongoDB based on the following characteristics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Document-oriented</strong>: Unlike <a id="_idIndexMarker289"/>traditional relational databases, which store data in tables with rows and columns, MongoDB stores data in flexible JSON-like documents. This makes it easier to represent complex data structures.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scalable</strong>: MongoDB can handle large datasets and high-traffic applications by scaling horizontally. It does this by adding more servers to the database cluster.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Flexible schema</strong>: MongoDB allows for flexible schema design. Documents within a collection can have different structures. This is useful for storing data that doesn’t fit neatly into rigid table structures.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cross-platform</strong>: MongoDB runs on various OSs, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Open source</strong>: The core MongoDB server is open source and free to use, with a variety of commercial licenses available for additional features and support.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To install MongoDB Server, just navigate to <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/">https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/</a> and select your platform. At the time of writing, you can install it on Linux, macOS, Windows, and Docker. MongoDB has two available editions: Community and Enterprise. To experiment and test it, the Community edition will be enough.</p>
			<p>Another useful product for interacting with MongoDB is the MongoDB Compass application. It can be found at <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass">https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass</a> and is free. You can install it for different platforms:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 4.13: MongoDB Compass supports different platforms" src="img/B09148_04_13.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.13: MongoDB Compass supports different platforms</p>
			<p>MongoDB Compass is a<a id="_idIndexMarker290"/> free, <strong class="bold">graphical user interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">GUI</strong>) tool specifically designed for interacting with MongoDB databases. It essentially acts as a user-friendly client application<a id="_idIndexMarker291"/> that simplifies managing and working with your data.</p>
			<p>You can use it for the following purposes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Visualizing data</strong>: Compass <a id="_idIndexMarker292"/>allows you to browse collections, view documents in a clear and organized format, and explore the structure of your data.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Querying</strong>: You can write and execute queries directly within Compass to filter and retrieve specific data from your MongoDB databases.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Building complex queries</strong>: Compass provides a visual interface for building aggregation pipelines, which are powerful tools for transforming and analyzing your data.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">CRUD operations</strong>: Compass allows you to easily </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">create, read, update, and delete</strong> (<strong class="bold">CRUD</strong>) documents<a id="_idIndexMarker293"/> within your collections.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Schema analysis</strong>: Compass helps you understand the structure and relationships within your data by providing schema visualization.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Index optimization</strong>: Compass can recommend and assist with creating indexes on your collections to optimize query performance.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Connection management</strong>: Compass<a id="_idIndexMarker294"/> allows you to connect to various MongoDB deployments, including local servers, cloud instances, and containers.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Overall, MongoDB Compass offers a user-friendly and intuitive way to interact with your MongoDB databases. It’s<a id="_idIndexMarker295"/> a valuable tool for database administrators, developers, and anyone who needs to explore, analyze, and manage their MongoDB data.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-71"><a id="_idTextAnchor072"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>Having a well-prepared development environment is crucial for a smooth and efficient software development process. By installing the necessary tools and programs beforehand, you eliminate the need to scramble for them mid-development, saving valuable time. A configured environment ensures a consistent workflow. You know exactly where your files are located, how to run them, and what commands to use. This reduces cognitive load and lets you focus on coding.</p>
			<p>Using the same tools throughout the project helps maintain code style and consistency. This makes the code easier to read, understand, and maintain for yourself and others.</p>
			<p>When everyone on the team uses the same development environment, collaboration becomes smoother. They can easily share code, troubleshoot issues, and understand each other’s work.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we talked about the tools we need to install before starting our development journey. Of course, we haven’t installed all the tools, but the main ones are here. We’ll introduce additional tools as needed in future chapters, ensuring the installation process is straightforward.</p>
			<p>If you’re here, then congratulations! Starting from the next chapter, we will dive into the details of microservice development in practice.</p>

		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-72" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"><a id="_idTextAnchor073"/>Part 2:Building and Managing Microservices</h1>
			<p>In this part, we will dive into the practical aspects of building microservices with JavaScript. We’ll start by creating a basic CRUD (Create, Read/Retrieve, Update, Delete) microservice and then move on to more advanced concepts, such as synchronous and asynchronous communication between services. We will also cover real-time data streaming, which is essential for creating responsive and dynamic applications.</p>
