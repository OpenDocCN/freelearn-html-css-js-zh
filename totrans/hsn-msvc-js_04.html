			<p>Knowing what tools and apps to use can speed up your development process significantly. That is why we need to prepare our development environment first before typing lines of code. The development environment should make you feel comfortable and help you throughout the process of learning and writing <span class="No-Break">your microservices.</span></p>
			<p>It is like building a house. Choosing the right tools can speed up the process and save you time. Of course, having the right tools doesn’t mean you will succeed, but it is better to fail with the right ones than to have the cause of failure be the choice <span class="No-Break">of tools.</span></p>
			<p>This chapter focuses on installing the required tools. The programming language and frameworks are also tools for us to build microservices. In one form or another, everything we use while writing software is a tool for us. It makes no sense to install all the tools we plan to use at this point, but at least understanding how to install most of them will help us to switch to <span class="No-Break">coding faster.</span></p>
			<p>We will also have a look at some of the Node.js frameworks that we plan to use in this book. Understanding them is crucial for fast and <span class="No-Break">easy development.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we’re going to cover the <span class="No-Break">following topics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Node.js and <span class="No-Break">its installation</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Node.js frameworks</span></li>
				<li>Choosing the <span class="No-Break">right IDE</span></li>
				<li>Understanding and <span class="No-Break">installing Docker</span></li>
				<li>Understanding and installing <span class="No-Break">Apache Kafka</span></li>
				<li>Understanding and <span class="No-Break">installing Git</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Installing Postman</span></li>
				<li><span class="No-Break">Installing MongoDB</span></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>To follow along with this chapter, you only need a browser of your choice and an internet connection. Regarding the rest of the tools we plan to use, we will learn how to install them in <span class="No-Break">this chapter.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>Node.js and its installation</h1>
			<p>As we learned in the previous <a id="_idIndexMarker225"/>chapter, Node.js is a runtime environment built on Google’s V8 engine. You can build a wide variety of applications <span class="No-Break">using it:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Web applications</strong>: Node.js is<a id="_idIndexMarker226"/> a popular choice for building<a id="_idIndexMarker227"/> both the backend and frontend of web applications. Its JavaScript-based environment makes it easy for developers to work on <span class="No-Break">both sides.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Real-time applications</strong>: Node.js’s<a id="_idIndexMarker228"/> event-driven architecture and non-blocking I/O model make it ideal for building real-time applications such as chat apps, collaboration tools, and streaming services. These applications require constant communication between users and the server, and Node.js can handle <span class="No-Break">this efficiently.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Single-page applications</strong> (<strong class="bold">SPAs</strong>): SPAs <a id="_idIndexMarker229"/>are web applications that load a single HTML page and update the content dynamically using JavaScript. Node.js can be used to build the backend API that provides data to the SPA <span class="No-Break">client-side code.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">API-driven applications</strong>: Many <a id="_idIndexMarker230"/>modern applications rely<a id="_idIndexMarker231"/> on <strong class="bold">application programming interfaces</strong> (<strong class="bold">APIs</strong>) to access data and functionality from other services. Node.js is a great choice for building these APIs due to its ability to handle many concurrent <span class="No-Break">requests efficiently.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Microservices</strong>: Node.js is well-suited <a id="_idIndexMarker232"/>for building microservices because of its modular nature and <span class="No-Break">asynchronous capabilities.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Command-line tools</strong>: Node.js can<a id="_idIndexMarker233"/> be used to create command-line tools that automate tasks or interact with <span class="No-Break">other systems.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Desktop applications</strong>: While less common, Node.js can also be used to build desktop applications <a id="_idIndexMarker234"/>with<a id="_idIndexMarker235"/> frameworks such <span class="No-Break">as Electron.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Of course, this is not the full list, but it gives you a good idea of the wide range of applications that can be built <span class="No-Break">with Node.js.</span></p>
			<p>Learning some<a id="_idIndexMarker236"/> technology or language mostly starts with installing the required tools. The same applies to Node.js. So, let’s dive into its <span class="No-Break">installation process.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/>Installing Node.js for Windows</h2>
			<p>You might be <a id="_idIndexMarker237"/>surprised but I’m a big fan of Microsoft and its <a id="_idIndexMarker238"/>products. This means I’m using a Windows <strong class="bold">operating system</strong> (<strong class="bold">OS</strong>). All <a id="_idIndexMarker239"/>types of installations will be explained using mainly the <em class="italic">Windows OS,</em> but I will provide the relevant links to help non-Windows users be on the same level <span class="No-Break">of progress.</span></p>
			<p>When installing Node.js from the official page (<a href="http://www.nodejs.org">www.nodejs.org</a>), it automatically detects your OS and provides the exact OS instructions to <span class="No-Break">install it.</span></p>
			<p>We also have different ways of installing Node.js, even for the same OS. The most popular ones are prebuilt installers and installation via <span class="No-Break">package manager.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s follow these step-by-step instructions to <span class="No-Break">install Node.js:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to <a href="http://www.nodejs.org/en/download">www.nodejs.org/en/download</a>. In my case, I’ll be using <span class="No-Break">Windows-based instructions.</span></li>
				<li>Select <span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">prebuilt installer</strong></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li>From the tab, select the required version of Node.js, along with the OS and CPU architecture to run it (<span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">.1</em></span><span class="No-Break">).</span><p class="list-inset">You might be wondering which version of Node.js to choose – <strong class="bold">LTS</strong> or <strong class="bold">Current</strong>? Well, the answer <span class="No-Break">is easy:</span></p><ul><li>For long-term use, where things need to stay stable and work well together, the <strong class="bold">LTS</strong> version is a safe bet. It’s a <span class="No-Break">reliable option.</span></li><li>On the other hand, the <strong class="bold">Current</strong> version has all the latest bells and whistles, which is great for programmers who want to try out <span class="No-Break">new features.</span></li></ul><p class="list-inset">For our code examples, the LTS version is sufficient. Select it <span class="No-Break">and continue.</span></p></li>

			<p>While Node.js is <a id="_idIndexMarker252"/>our <a id="_idIndexMarker253"/>primary tool<a id="_idIndexMarker254"/> while developing microservices, throughout the learning process, we will also use some of Node.js’s frameworks to make our lives easier. The most popular ones that we’ll use in this book are <em class="italic">NestJS</em> <span class="No-Break">and </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Express.js</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>Node.js frameworks</h1>
			<p>Node.js has a lot of<a id="_idIndexMarker255"/> interesting frameworks. We’ll be using <em class="italic">NestJS</em> and <em class="italic">Express.js</em> (we look at more on these frameworks shortly) but of course, more frameworks rely on Node.js, and it is impossible to use all of them in a single book and even if possible, it doesn’t make too much sense to <span class="No-Break">do it.</span></p>
			<p>First things first, Node.js is not a framework but a runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside the browser. Some developers call it a framework but that is not true. We need to understand the term framework to understand whether something is a framework or not. In programming, a <strong class="bold">framework</strong> is essentially a pre-built structure that serves as a foundation for creating software applications. It’s like a blueprint that you can customize to fit your specific needs, rather than having to start entirely from scratch. Frameworks come with pre-written code for common functionalities, such as handling user input, database interactions, or security. These components act as building blocks that you can leverage to save time <span class="No-Break">and effort.</span></p>
			<p>Frameworks often have a defined way of organizing your code, which ensures consistency and makes it easier for other developers to understand and maintain the <span class="No-Break">code base.</span></p>
			<p>A key aspect of frameworks is an <em class="italic">inversion of control</em>. Instead of your code calling into the framework, the framework calls your code at specific points. This allows the framework to manage the overall flow of <span class="No-Break">the application.</span></p>
			<p>With that information, you can tell Node.js is not a framework. It is just a runtime, but we have frameworks that are built on <em class="italic">top</em> of Node.js. The most popular ones are <em class="italic">NestJS</em>, <em class="italic">Express.js</em>, <em class="italic">MeteorJS</em>, and <em class="italic">SailsJS</em>. Oh, by the way – many popular frameworks, such as <em class="italic">Sails</em>, <em class="italic">NestJS</em>, <em class="italic">Kraken</em>, <em class="italic">poet</em>, and <em class="italic">Item API</em>, are built on Express. As mentioned <a id="_idIndexMarker256"/>previously, we’ll be using NestJS and Express.js, so let’s look at <span class="No-Break">them closely.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-62"><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>Express.js</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Express.js</strong> simplifies the <a id="_idIndexMarker257"/>web development process. By using<a id="_idIndexMarker258"/> Express.js effectively, you can create dynamic and interactive web experiences for your users. Because Express.js is lightweight, it’s a great choice for creating web applications that need to perform well under heavy traffic. One of the key features of Express.js is its ability to handle different routes, which are essentially paths users take to access specific parts of your <span class="No-Break">web application.</span></p>
			<p>Imagine Node.js as the building blocks and tools, like bricks and mortar. Express.js is like prefabricated walls and plumbing – it gives you a structured way to assemble those blocks to create a web application faster. Building a complex web application with just Node.js can get messy. Express.js provides a framework so that you can organize your code into routes, middleware, and views, making it more maintainable and easier for others <span class="No-Break">to understand.</span></p>
			<p>While you can build everything from scratch with Node.js, Express.js offers built-in features for handling routes, handling HTTP requests and responses, and creating APIs, saving you time <span class="No-Break">and effort.</span></p>
			<p>Express.js is a popular framework with a vast community of developers. This means you have access to a wealth of resources, tutorials, and additional libraries to streamline development. While there are other Node.js frameworks available, Express.js is a strong choice due to its <a id="_idIndexMarker259"/>simplicity, flexibility, and large <span class="No-Break">community </span><span class="No-Break"><a id="_idIndexMarker260"/></span><span class="No-Break">support.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-63"><a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>NestJS</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">NestJS</strong> is a framework <a id="_idIndexMarker261"/>built on top of Node.js that is specifically useful <a id="_idIndexMarker262"/>for building robust and scalable <span class="No-Break">server-side applications.</span></p>
			<p>NestJS enforces a clear and organized architecture for your application. This makes complex projects easier to manage and maintain, especially for teams of developers. It integrates seamlessly with TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing for improved code reliability and fewer errors. It also promotes a modular approach, where you break down your application into smaller, reusable components. This makes your code base more organized and easier to scale as your <span class="No-Break">application grows.</span></p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Another piece of good news is that if you’re familiar with <em class="italic">Angular</em>, a popular frontend framework that NestJS borrows many concepts, it makes it easier to learn and use for <span class="No-Break">Angular developers.</span></p>
			<p>NestJS goes beyond basic web applications. You can build RESTful APIs, GraphQL APIs, WebSockets applications, and even command-line interfaces using <span class="No-Break">this framework.</span></p>
			<p>It also <a id="_idIndexMarker263"/>utilizes <strong class="bold">dependency injection</strong>, a powerful technique for managing dependencies between different parts of your application. This promotes loose coupling and makes your code <span class="No-Break">more testable.</span></p>
			<p>Long story short, NestJS provides a structured and feature-rich toolkit on top of Node.js, allowing you to build scalable and maintainable server-side <span class="No-Break">applications efficiently.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>Choosing between Express.js and Node.js</h2>
			<p>This book is <a id="_idIndexMarker264"/>not about Node.js <a id="_idIndexMarker265"/>frameworks, and our aim is not to provide full information about them. However, having fundamental knowledge about the differences between these two will help us to have a broader understanding. Let’s outline some situations where either of these frameworks would be a good fit. With this understanding, you’ll be able to make a more informed decision and pick the right framework for <span class="No-Break">your project:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Use Express.js in the </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">following situations</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><ul><li>If your project is small or medium-sized. For simpler web applications or APIs, Express.js’s lightweight and flexible nature might <span class="No-Break">be ideal.</span></li><li>If you prioritize flexibility. Express.js offers more control over your application’s structure, allowing you to tailor it to your <span class="No-Break">specific needs.</span></li><li>If you’re familiar with JavaScript. If you’re comfortable with vanilla JavaScript, the learning curve for Express.js <span class="No-Break">is gentler.</span></li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Use NestJS in the </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">following situations</strong></span><span class="No-Break">:</span><ul><li>If your project is large or complex. NestJS’s structured architecture and features are beneficial for managing and maintaining bigger applications with <span class="No-Break">multiple developers.</span></li><li>If you value scalability. NestJS’s modular design makes it easier to scale your application as it grows in terms of features <span class="No-Break">and complexity.</span></li><li>If you want built-in features. NestJS offers features such as dependency injection and support for TypeScript out of the box, improving code maintainability <span class="No-Break">and reliability.</span></li><li>If your team is familiar with Angular. If your developers have experience with Angular, NestJS’s <a id="_idIndexMarker266"/>similar <a id="_idIndexMarker267"/>structure can ease the <span class="No-Break">learning curve.</span></li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>After installing Node.js, we need to prepare our <strong class="bold">integrated development environment</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDE</strong>) <span class="No-Break">for development.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-65"><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>Choosing the right IDE</h1>
			<p>Choosing the right<a id="_idIndexMarker268"/> IDE may help you do fast development. For Node.js development, especially to follow our code examples, we don’t have strict requirements related to IDE. You can use your favorite text editor or built-in text editor for your OS. Choosing the right IDE is a taste and functionality preference. An IDE helps you in syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and refactoring, and also easily interacts with important libraries. You can use different IDEs, such as <em class="italic">Visual Studio Code</em>, <em class="italic">Eclipse Che</em>, <em class="italic">Sublime Text</em>, <em class="italic">WebStorm</em>, and <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">IntelliJ IDEA</em></span><span class="No-Break">.</span></p>
			<p>We prefer Visual Studio Code because it is free, easy to use, can be extended using extensions, is cross-platform compatible, easily configurable, and supports multiple <span class="No-Break">programming languages.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s install Visual Studio Code. To install it, just follow <span class="No-Break">these instructions:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go <span class="No-Break">to </span><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download"><span class="No-Break">https://code.visualstudio.com/download</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>
				<li>Click on your OS version and wait for the download to <span class="No-Break">be completed.</span></li>
				<li>Click on the file you’ve downloaded and follow the <span class="No-Break">default instructions.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<p>As you learn microservices <a id="_idIndexMarker269"/>development, you’ll become familiar with the classical application installation process. For that reason, we haven’t provided detailed screenshots and won’t be spending too much time on installation details. For more information, you can simply search for the relevant application installation instructions <span class="No-Break">on Google.</span></p>
			<p>Visual Studio Code provides a rich extension library for all needs (<span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 4</em></span><em class="italic">.7</em>). You can download anything you want to help you do fast development, refactor, highlight your code, <span class="No-Break">and more:</span></p>

			<p>After installing our IDE, it is time to install Docker. It is a must-have tool, especially nowadays for <a id="_idIndexMarker270"/>microservice application development. We’ll be actively using Docker in our development, so let’s <span class="No-Break">dive in.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-66"><a id="_idTextAnchor067"/>Understanding and installing Docker</h1>
			<p>Before installing <a id="_idIndexMarker271"/>Docker, we need to understand its value <span class="No-Break">and purpose.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Docker</strong> is like a shipping container for your software. It packages everything your application needs to run – the code, libraries, and settings – and bundles them together. This ensures your application runs everywhere, in any OS without any issues. It guarantees that if the application works locally, it will <span class="No-Break">work globally.</span></p>
			<p>Docker guarantees your application runs exactly how you built it, every time. No more surprises due to different <span class="No-Break">computer setups.</span></p>
			<p>The main concepts in Docker are images and containers. <strong class="bold">Containers</strong> are <a id="_idIndexMarker272"/>lightweight and start up quickly, making testing and development cycles much smoother. You can simply ship the Docker container to any environment, cloud-based or not, and be confident it will work. Containers share the underlying OS, so you can run more applications on a single machine without bogging <span class="No-Break">it down.</span></p>
			<p>In the world of Docker, an <strong class="bold">image</strong> is like a blueprint for a Docker container. It’s a set of instructions that specify what goes inside the container, including the software, libraries, and configurations needed for your application to run. You build an image once, and you can use it to create many containers, saving you time and effort. Images can be shared and downloaded easily, allowing you to run your application on any machine with Docker. One of the advantages of images is that everyone using the same image gets the same environment, reducing surprises and ensuring reliable <span class="No-Break">application behavior.</span></p>
			<p>If you don’t want to install some applications to your computer <em class="italic">forever</em> and easily remove them after development is done, it would be better to not directly install them but use Docker for <span class="No-Break">your installation.</span></p>
			<p>In the end, Docker simplifies the process of building, shipping, and running applications. It’s like having a<a id="_idIndexMarker273"/> universal box for your software, ensuring it runs flawlessly wherever <span class="No-Break">it goes.</span></p>
			<p>That’s enough theory – let’s dive into the Docker <span class="No-Break">installation process.</span></p>
			<p>You can install Docker for almost all popular OSs, such as Windows, Linux, and Mac. It may have specific requirements for your OS, which you can learn about by navigating to <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/">https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/</a>. Then, you can select your OS to <span class="No-Break">install it.</span></p>

			<p>Docker is not the only powerful tool that we need to use when building microservices. We have another<a id="_idIndexMarker275"/> great tool that helps us have real-time communication between our microservices: <span class="No-Break">Apache Kafka.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-67"><a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>Understanding and installing Apache Kafka</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Apache Kafka</strong> is an<a id="_idIndexMarker276"/> open-source platform that handles real-time data streams. Originally designed as a messaging queue, it has evolved into a robust system for streaming data and building event-driven architectures. Communication between microservices is crucial, and that’s where <span class="No-Break">Kafka shines.</span></p>
			<p>Kafka itself is a huge concept that needs a different book. In this book, we’re going to provide enough information that we’ll be able to integrate and use it for our microservices. For more detailed information, you can follow my <em class="italic">Apache Kafka for Distributed Systems</em> course on the Udemy <span class="No-Break">platform (</span><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/apache-kafka-for-distributed-systems/"><span class="No-Break">https://www.udemy.com/course/apache-kafka-for-distributed-systems/</span></a><span class="No-Break">).</span></p>
			<p>Kafka uses a <strong class="bold">publish-subscribe</strong> messaging model. Services, acting as producers, publish events to specific channels <a id="_idIndexMarker277"/>known as <strong class="bold">topics</strong> within Kafka. Other services, functioning as consumers, subscribe to relevant topics and receive these <span class="No-Break">events asynchronously.</span></p>
			<p>This approach beautifully decouples services from one another. Producers don’t need to wait for consumers to be available, and consumers can process events at their own pace. This improves scalability <span class="No-Break">and flexibility.</span></p>
			<p>Kafka also acts as a buffer, storing events until consumers are ready. This enables asynchronous processing, which prevents bottlenecks and improves overall <span class="No-Break">system responsiveness.</span></p>
			<p>Kafka is built for reliability. It replicates data across multiple nodes, ensuring that messages aren’t lost even if a server fails. This enhances fault tolerance within the <span class="No-Break">microservices architecture.</span></p>
			<p>It’s important to know that Kafka scales horizontally. You can easily add more nodes to handle increasing data volumes without impacting existing services. This caters perfectly to the dynamic nature <span class="No-Break">of microservices.</span></p>
			<p>As mentioned previously, a key feature of Kafka is its ability to handle real-time data streams. This is valuable for microservices that need to react to events promptly, such as in fraud detection or stock <span class="No-Break">trading applications.</span></p>
			<p>Kafka is flexibly related to programming languages and integrates seamlessly with various programming languages, making it adaptable to diverse <span class="No-Break">microservice environments.</span></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Kafka Streams</strong>, a powerful<a id="_idIndexMarker278"/> API within Kafka, empowers you to perform real-time computations and transformations on data streams within the Kafka cluster itself. This stream processing capability adds significant value to <span class="No-Break">microservice architectures.</span></p>
			<p>Long story short, by integrating Apache Kafka, microservice development benefits from increased scalability, resilience, and agility. It fosters a loosely coupled, event-driven approach that empowers microservices to communicate and react to changes effectively. This translates to a more robust, adaptable, and high-performing <span class="No-Break">application architecture.</span></p>
			<p>Apache Kafka’s installation varies by OS, and you need some additional configuration <span class="No-Break">per OS.</span></p>
			<p>Also, along with Apache <a id="_idIndexMarker279"/>Kafka, we may use Zookeeper and Kafka UI. Starting from Apache Kafka <strong class="source-inline">v4</strong>, you won’t need Zookeeper. However, this feature is still in development, so it makes sense to understand it also. Zookeeper has multiple responsibilities and plays a critical role as <span class="No-Break">the coordinator.</span></p>
			<p>Kafka itself is a CLI-based tool, so if you want to see things graphically, you’ll need additional tools, such as Kafka UI, Offset Explorer, <span class="No-Break">and more.</span></p>
			<p>But I have good news for you. If you have Docker installed, there is no need to dive into the details of the installation process. We can create a <strong class="source-inline">docker-compose</strong> file to combine the required tools and install them together. You can download files one by one, but <strong class="source-inline">docker-compose</strong> helps you to create a special YAML file where you can define all the tools and application dependencies and install them together. Here is our <strong class="source-inline">docker-compose</strong> <span class="No-Break">file’s content:</span></p>

			<p>Now, we are ready <a id="_idIndexMarker281"/>to move forward and understand how to install Git, an essential tool under a <span class="No-Break">developer’s belt.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-68"><a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>Understanding and installing Git</h1>
			<p>Git is a powerful <strong class="bold">version control system</strong> (<strong class="bold">VCS</strong>) for <a id="_idIndexMarker282"/>software<a id="_idIndexMarker283"/> development. Imagine it as a time machine for your code. It tracks every change you make to your project, like a <span class="No-Break">detailed logbook.</span></p>
			<p>With Git, you can easily revert to a previous version of your code, essentially undoing <span class="No-Break">any errors.</span></p>
			<p>It makes collaboration easy. Working with a team? Git lets everyone collaborate seamlessly. Each team member can work on their part of the project, and Git helps merge their changes smoothly, <span class="No-Break">avoiding conflicts.</span></p>
			<p>It also keeps a detailed history of all the changes, allowing you to see exactly what modifications were made and by whom. This is crucial for tracking progress and understanding the <span class="No-Break">project’s journey.</span></p>
			<p>Git is one of the most important tools that we use in our day-to-day development process. You can install Git for any popular OS, particularly for Linux, Windows, <span class="No-Break">and Mac:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li>For more detailed instructions for <em class="italic">Linux</em>, go to <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/linux">https://git-scm.com/download/linux</a>. There, you can find a Linux-distribution-based installation <span class="No-Break">for Git.</span></li>

			<p>There’s another<a id="_idIndexMarker284"/> tool we need to install. Let’s continue our installation journey <span class="No-Break">with Postman.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-69"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>Installing Postman</h1>
			<p>The penultimate <a id="_idIndexMarker285"/>tool we’ll cover in this chapter is Postman. We’ll build a lot of APIs, and we need some tools to rapidly and easily test them. It’s a tool that helps developers interact with and <span class="No-Break">test APIs.</span></p>
			<p>Here’s what Postman helps <span class="No-Break">you do:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Build APIs</strong>: You can design and plan out your API using <span class="No-Break">Postman’s tools.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Test APIs</strong>: Send requests (such as asking for information) and see the responses (the information you get back) from the API. This helps ensure the API works <span class="No-Break">as expected.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Work with APIs</strong>: Postman lets you easily send different kinds of requests to APIs and see the results. It’s like having a remote control for <span class="No-Break">the API.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p> Here’s how you can <span class="No-Break">install it:</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go <span class="No-Break">to </span><a href="https://www.postman.com/downloads/"><span class="No-Break">https://www.postman.com/downloads/</span></a><span class="No-Break">.</span></li>

			<p>With that, let’s move<a id="_idIndexMarker287"/> on to the final tool in this <span class="No-Break">chapter: MongoDB.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-70"><a id="_idTextAnchor071"/>Installing MongoDB</h1>
			<p>MongoDB is a popular <a id="_idIndexMarker288"/>NoSQL database. We will use it when we develop microservices and it might be a good choice for you in the future when you <span class="No-Break">build microservices.</span></p>
			<p>You may consider MongoDB based on the <span class="No-Break">following characteristics:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Document-oriented</strong>: Unlike <a id="_idIndexMarker289"/>traditional relational databases, which store data in tables with rows and columns, MongoDB stores data in flexible JSON-like documents. This makes it easier to represent complex <span class="No-Break">data structures.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scalable</strong>: MongoDB can handle large datasets and high-traffic applications by scaling horizontally. It does this by adding more servers to the <span class="No-Break">database cluster.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Flexible schema</strong>: MongoDB allows for flexible schema design. Documents within a collection can have different structures. This is useful for storing data that doesn’t fit neatly into rigid <span class="No-Break">table structures.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cross-platform</strong>: MongoDB runs on various OSs, including Windows, Linux, <span class="No-Break">and macOS.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Open source</strong>: The core MongoDB server is open source and free to use, with a variety of commercial licenses available for additional features <span class="No-Break">and support.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>To install MongoDB Server, just navigate to <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/">https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/</a> and select your platform. At the time of writing, you can install it on Linux, macOS, Windows, and Docker. MongoDB has two available editions: Community and Enterprise. To experiment and test it, the Community edition will <span class="No-Break">be enough.</span></p>
			<p>Another useful product for interacting with MongoDB is the MongoDB Compass application. It can be found at <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass">https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass</a> and is free. You can install it for <span class="No-Break">different platforms:</span></p>

				<li><strong class="bold">Building complex queries</strong>: Compass provides a visual interface for building aggregation pipelines, which are powerful tools for transforming and analyzing <span class="No-Break">your data.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">CRUD operations</strong>: Compass allows you to easily </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">create, read, update, and delete</strong> (<strong class="bold">CRUD</strong>) documents<a id="_idIndexMarker293"/> within <span class="No-Break">your collections.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Schema analysis</strong>: Compass helps you understand the structure and relationships within your data by providing <span class="No-Break">schema visualization.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Index optimization</strong>: Compass can recommend and assist with creating indexes on your collections to optimize <span class="No-Break">query performance.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Connection management</strong>: Compass<a id="_idIndexMarker294"/> allows you to connect to various MongoDB deployments, including local servers, cloud instances, <span class="No-Break">and containers.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Overall, MongoDB Compass offers a user-friendly and intuitive way to interact with your MongoDB databases. It’s<a id="_idIndexMarker295"/> a valuable tool for database administrators, developers, and anyone who needs to explore, analyze, and manage their <span class="No-Break">MongoDB data.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-71"><a id="_idTextAnchor072"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>Having a well-prepared development environment is crucial for a smooth and efficient software development process. By installing the necessary tools and programs beforehand, you eliminate the need to scramble for them mid-development, saving valuable time. A configured environment ensures a consistent workflow. You know exactly where your files are located, how to run them, and what commands to use. This reduces cognitive load and lets you focus <span class="No-Break">on coding.</span></p>
			<p>Using the same tools throughout the project helps maintain code style and consistency. This makes the code easier to read, understand, and maintain for yourself <span class="No-Break">and others.</span></p>
			<p>When everyone on the team uses the same development environment, collaboration becomes smoother. They can easily share code, troubleshoot issues, and understand each <span class="No-Break">other’s work.</span></p>
			<p>In this chapter, we talked about the tools we need to install before starting our development journey. Of course, we haven’t installed all the tools, but the main ones are here. We’ll introduce additional tools as needed in future chapters, ensuring the installation process <span class="No-Break">is straightforward.</span></p>
			<p>If you’re here, then congratulations! Starting from the next chapter, we will dive into the details of microservice development <span class="No-Break">in practice.</span></p>
