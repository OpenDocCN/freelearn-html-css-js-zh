			<p>Three.js has become the standard way of creating stunning 3D WebGL content over the last couple of years. In this edition, we’ll look at all the features of Three.js and provide additional content on how to integrate Three.js with Blender, React, TypeScript, and the newest physics engine.</p>
			<p>In this book, you’ll learn how to create and animate immersive 3D scenes directly in your browser using the full potential of WebGL and modern browsers.</p>
			<p>The book starts with the basic concepts and building blocks used in Three.js and helps you explore these essential topics in detail through extensive examples and code samples. You’ll also learn how to create realistic-looking 3D objects using textures and materials. Besides creating these objects manually, we’ll also explain how to load existing models from an external source. Next, you’ll understand how to easily control the camera using the Three.js built-in camera controls, which will enable you to fly or walk around the 3D scene you’ve created. Later chapters will then show you how to use the HTML5 video and canvas elements as materials for your 3D objects and animate your models. You will learn how to use morph and skeleton-based animation, before understanding how to add physics, such as gravity and collision detection, to your scene. Finally, we’ll explain how to combine Blender with Three.js, how to integrate Three.js with React and TypeScript, and how you can use Three.js to create VR and AR scenes.</p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you’ll have gained the skills you need to create 3D-animated graphics using Three.js.</p>
