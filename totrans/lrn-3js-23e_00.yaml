- en: In the last couple of years, browsers have become more powerful and are capable
    platforms to deliver complex applications and graphics. Most of these, though,
    are standard 2D graphics. Most modern browsers have adopted WebGL, which allows
    you to not just create 2D applications and graphics in the browser, but also create
    beautiful and good performing 3D applications using the capabilities of the GPU.

- en: Programming WebGL directly, however, is very complex. You need to know the inner
    details of WebGL and learn a complex shader language to get the most out of WebGL.
    Three.js provides a very easy to use JavaScript API around the features of WebGL,
    so you can create beautiful 3D graphics without having to learn WebGL in detail.

    3D scenes directly in your browser. In this book, you'll learn all the different
    APIs Three.js has to offer through lots of interactive examples and code samples.

    *Creating Your First 3D Scene with Three.js*, covers the basic steps you need
    to take to get started with Three.js. You''ll immediately create your first Three.js
    scene and at the end of this chapter, you''ll be able to create and animate your
    first 3D scene directly in your browser.'

    Scene"), *Basic Components That Make Up a Three.js Scene,* explains the basic
    components that you need to understand when working with Three.js. You''ll learn
    about lights, meshes, geometries, materials, and cameras. In this chapter, you
    will also get an overview of the different lights Three.js provides and the cameras
    you can use in your scene.'

    shows examples and explains how to use a spotlight, a direction light, an ambient
    light, a point light, a hemisphere light, and an area light. Additionally, it
    also shows how to apply a lens flare effect on your light source.'

    to Work with Geometries*, is the first of two chapters that explores all the geometries
    that are provided by Three.js. In this chapter, you''ll learn how to create and
    configure geometries in Three.js and can experiment using the provided interactive
    examples with geometries (such as plane, circle, shape, cube, sphere, cylinder,
    torus, torusknot, and polyhedron).'

    left off. It shows you how to configure and use the more advanced geometries provided
    by Three.js such as convex and lathe. In this chapter, you''ll also learn how
    to extrude 3D geometries from 2D shapes, and how you can create new geometries
    by combining geometries using binary operations.'
