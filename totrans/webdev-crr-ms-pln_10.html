<h1 id="_idParaDest-260"><a id="_idTextAnchor260"/>Discovering the Keys to Quality Work as a Web Developer</h1>
<p>Learning to code and landing a web development position is all well and good, but once you do that, it’s time to start thinking about the things you can do to ensure you perform well. And not just perform well, but continue to improve your performance over time and help, if it’s what you want, to move up the corporate ladder of success.</p>
<p>I’m talking about things such as attention to detail, learning to use search engines and other online tools effectively, how to make effective use of developer tools that aren’t focused on producing code but rather ensuring the quality of the code you write, and your ability to multitask. These are things that anyone can learn and know, regardless of your level of experience, and that should become habits over time (even if you stop consciously thinking about them after a while).</p>
<p>These skills are important because the goal is to always be working at a high level of quality and always producing solid results, but without killing yourself to achieve it. Your boss will want this of you, but if you take personal pride in your work, then it becomes (relatively) easy to make that boss happy.</p>
<p>So, in this chapter, we’ll cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sweating the small stuff</li>
<li>Exercising your Google-Fu</li>
<li>Recognizing MVP sites</li>
<li>Tooling around – other tools to know about and use</li>
<li>Multitasking (like a CPU on the wind!)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-261"><a id="_idTextAnchor261"/>Sweating the small stuff</h1>
<p>You have probably heard <a id="_idIndexMarker947"/>the expression “Don’t sweat the small stuff.” The idea here is to not let stress build by worrying about things that have a low impact, or that you can’t do much about. However, in earlier chapters, I made the point that attention to detail is a key attribute of a good developer. “Sweating the small stuff,” as I like to say, is what web development is all about.</p>
<p>Having good attention to detail is an important skill to cultivate in yourself because while it’s obvious that big mistakes can lead to big problems, small oversights can sometimes snowball into significant issues as well, if not necessarily with the same immediacy.</p>
<p>So, you <em class="italic">do</em> have to sweat the small stuff in this field, but the phrase, in this case, isn’t about managing stress – it’s about being as thorough and as accurate in your work as you can be, accounting for as much as you can, whether big or small. This is a crucial skill in producing work that is as robust, efficient, and bug-free as possible.</p>
<p>Scrutinizing code, thoughtfully considering system architecture, and ensuring your designs meet both current and future needs are the things we’re most interested in doing well and with proper attention to detail.</p>
<p>As an example, let’s say that you’re building a website that involves storing user information. This involves writing information to a relational database. You might decide that the key of your user table – the column that uniquely identifies a user – should be a combination of each person’s first and last names. This might seem reasonable at first, and in fact, it would work perfectly fine, at least for a while. But what happens if two people with the same first and last name – a situation that certainly can occur in the real world – try signing up? Due to a relatively small mistake in the database’s design, a new user can’t even register due to the name conflict. Or worse, the system could, depending on how the code is written, comingle the two people’s data. Ironically, as I wrote these words, I’m dealing with a situation where my insurance company has somehow comingled my and my dad’s accounts precisely because we have the same first and last names. You wouldn’t think things like that happen for real, but you’d be very wrong!</p>
<p>So, learning to pay attention to details is important. It can also be difficult because, especially early in your career, you won’t have much experience to base your observations on. All you can do at that point is to try and think through various scenarios, game them out, and look for gotchas as best you can. Experience isn’t a guarantee of success, nor is it always needed. Thinking logically – another point I’ve made a few times – is ultimately what it comes down to. Of course, the more experience you have, the better you will be able to think logically since you’ll have more information to base it on, but it’s not the be-all, end-all of attention to detail.</p>
<p>You also have to be a little bit careful if you focus too exclusively on the minutia of a project as you can sometimes lose the forest for the trees, as the saying goes. You also always need to be mindful of the big picture and keep sight of the overall goals and objectives that the details work to achieve. Striking the right balance is what’s needed, and that primarily comes from practice. You’ve got to do these things and exercise these mental muscles to build them up properly over time.</p>
<p>When it comes to <a id="_idIndexMarker948"/>attention to detail, perhaps the most important consideration is focus, and how you can keep your mind pointed in the right direction, or to say it another way: staying in the moment.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-262"><a id="_idTextAnchor262"/>Staying in the moment</h2>
<p>One trick that can<a id="_idIndexMarker949"/> help you achieve better attention to detail is “staying in the moment.” It’s easy for all of us to become distracted by the various trials and tribulations of life – we all have things working in the back of our minds almost all the time, things we’re worried about or persistent problems we’re trying to solve – but the trick is to learn to push that stuff way back in your mind and focus on the here and now, on the main problem at hand.</p>
<p>If your mind is wandering or pre-occupied by things other than, for example, working on that database mentioned earlier – even if you don’t immediately realize it’s happening – you will often find your focus isn’t where it needs to be, and you’ll wind up missing details that could have led you to better decisions, such as the problem with the key of the database if you use names. The problem with the key may have occurred to you if you were fully focused on that design task and not allowing your mind to wander (there are never any guarantees of course, but you want to give yourself the best odds at least).</p>
<p>While staying in the moment is a general concept, there are some concrete steps you can take to help you achieve this – things we <a id="_idIndexMarker950"/>call <strong class="bold">mindfulness exercises</strong>. These are practices that are designed to help bring your attention to the present moment and help you become more aware of your thoughts, feelings, and surroundings. They can be quite beneficial for improving focus, reducing stress, and enhancing overall well-being.</p>
<p>Specifically, here are some common mindfulness exercises you can work on:</p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic">Mindful breathing</em>: This is perhaps the most basic mindfulness exercise, but also can be the most useful. All it takes is to focus your attention on your breath. Notice the inhalation and exhalation, the rhythm of it. It’s an autonomic function of your body, of course, something you rarely pay attention to (unless there’s a problem!), so focusing on it can be an interesting experience. When your mind inevitably wanders, gently bring it back to your breath, and re-focus on the moment. This can be done anywhere at any time, even for just a few minutes, and can not only help you learn to focus on details but can also serve as a fantastic way to simply relax, which also tends to aid in attention to detail.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Body scan meditation</em>: This exercise might not fly in an office environment, but it’s something you can do at home. You simply lie down or sit in a comfortable chair and focus your attention slowly and deliberately on each part of your body, from your toes to <a id="_idIndexMarker951"/>the top of your head. You’re “scanning” your body, in other words. As you do, notice any sensations, tension, or discomfort in each part, and try to relax any tension you notice.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Mindful observation</em>: To do this exercise, choose an object in your vicinity – any object will do – and focus your mind on just observing it for a minute or two. Notice everything you can about it, observing it as if you’re seeing it for the first time. If you happen to be near a window, finding a bird, squirrel, or other animal can be an especially enjoyable “object” to use for this exercise.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Mindful listening</em>: Instead of focusing on an object as with mindful observation, this exercise involves listening to sounds in your environment, whether it’s the chirping of birds, the rustling of leaves, or distant traffic.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Mindful eating</em>: While this exercise probably isn’t something that will typically help you pay attention to detail during a given task, it’s an exercise that can hone your skill a bit by exercising it with a common example. This exercise involves paying full attention to the simple, everyday experience of eating! As you eat, take notice of the color, texture, and taste of your food. Chew slowly and be aware of the sensations and flavors in each bite. You can almost make a game of it! It will train your brain to focus more on the moment, getting it used to the sensation of doing so.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Walking meditation</em>: In a similar vein, practice mindfulness while walking. This involves becoming aware of the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the rhythm of your steps, and your breathing. Take note of the simple fact that your legs are moving more or less on their own! It’s kind of a weird thing to realize! Also, take care to see the sights, sounds, and smells around you as you walk.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Mindful stretching or yoga</em>: Many people do yoga regularly, and for good reason: it can help focus the mind! Fortunately, it doesn’t require buying a proper yoga mat and finding a good yoga class in your town. Instead, you can sit in a comfortable position and engage in slow, deliberate, light stretching, taking care to pay attention to the physical sensations in your muscles and joints as you move. The key here is to be very gentle because this exercise is supposed to be relaxing, so you don’t want to overdo it, especially if this isn’t a regular activity for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>One final general “exercise” is simply to take a break from what you’re doing for a few minutes and allow your mind to wander for a little while! You’d be surprised how just letting go for a minute or two can paradoxically help you re-focus on the task at hand afterward. In addition, it allows your mind time to process things at a lower level, which is often exactly what you need to break through a tricky problem or challenge.</p>
<p>Of course, attention to detail and sweating the small stuff is the goal, but at some point, you’re going to have to simply know stuff to get your work done. But not one of us knows everything, myself<a id="_idIndexMarker952"/> included! What we <em class="italic">do</em> all have to know though is how to find the information we need and gain the knowledge we require as we go, and one of the primary ways in this day and age to do so is through online search engines. Let’s talk about that a bit now.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-263"><a id="_idTextAnchor263"/>Exercising your Google-Fu</h1>
<p>As I’ve mentioned<a id="_idIndexMarker953"/> a few times before, as a web developer, you won’t be expected to know everything off the top of your head. There is simply too much to know – too much to keep in your meat-computer all at once. Instead, what <em class="italic">will</em> be expected of you is that you keep some general concepts in your head, particularly concerning the stuff you’re using at the moment in your head – if you’re currently writing a lot of JavaScript, then it’s reasonable (and, fortunately, natural) to start to remember things such as the methods available on arrays since you’ll be using those frequently</p>
<p>But what will <em class="italic">always</em> be expected is that you can search for information when you need it and synthesize it into actions as you go. The term “Google-Fu” is often used to describe this ability, playfully combining “Google” and “Kung-fu” to describe a person’s skill and efficient use of Google (or any search engine). It involves the ability to quickly find precise information.</p>
<p>You may think that just means entering the right keywords, and that’s a big part of it, but it also involves understanding how search engines work and using advanced search techniques such as Boolean operators, filters, and specific search commands to create better search terms that more quickly and accurately get you the information you need.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a few of these key points that play into developing your Google-Fu skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic">Effective keyword selection</em>: It <a id="_idIndexMarker954"/>should come as no surprise that choosing precise, relevant keywords is necessary to get you the information you need quickly. For example, searching for <code>array methods</code> won’t provide such specific results compared to <code>javascript array methods</code>. However, you also have to be aware that being <em class="italic">too</em> specific can result in missing some results that would have been useful. For example, searching for <code>javascript array methods that deal with collections</code> might filter out some sites dealing with methods such as <code>map()</code> and <code>reduce()</code> – this is because some sites might discuss these methods without actually using the word collections, so they wouldn’t match your query as much as others. Those sites may also be ranked lower in the results, causing you to miss them either way. It’s all about finding the right balance between being specific <em class="italic">enough</em> but not <em class="italic">too</em> specific.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Boolean operators</em>: Google allows you to use the same sort of Boolean keywords as most programming languages do, allowing you to craft more precise search terms. For example, searching for <code>javascript array methods for collections not map</code> can get you the results you need if you know that <code>map()</code> isn’t involved. The <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code> keywords are the most common Boolean operators to be used in this way.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Quotes</em>: When using a search engine such as Google, you have to understand the difference between using and not using quotes. When you use quotes, you’re telling Google to search for that <em class="italic">exact</em> phrase. Searching for <code>"javascript methods of array"</code> will only find pages that say <code>javascript methods of array</code> in that precise way.<p class="list-inset">Without the quotes, sites that contain the words <code>javascript</code>, <code>methods</code>, and <code>array</code> will be in the result (Google and most other search engines drop frequently used words <a id="_idIndexMarker955"/>such as <code>of</code> and <code>an</code>). As with effective keyword selection, quoting a search term can unnecessarily make your search too specific and cause you to miss good results.</p></li>
<li><em class="italic">Asterisks</em>: In a search term, an asterisk can be used as a wildcard. A wildcard essentially means “can be anything.” For example, searching for <code>*zamm*</code> means that so long as <code>zamm</code> appears in a result, there can be anything before and/or after it (or nothing before and/or after it) and it will match. So, for example, results with Zammetti in it would be found (because there’s nothing before <code>zamm</code>, which the leading asterisk allows for, and <code>etti</code> after it, which the trailing asterisk allows for), as well as the Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics (which is named ZAMM and therefore would satisfy the wildcards as well), ZAMM Foods, Zamm Advisors, and Alex Zamm.<p class="list-inset">You should use this sparingly as it can often lead to a lot of results unrelated to what you’re looking for, but it can sometimes be useful, especially if combined with other keywords and perhaps Boolean operators. For example, searching for <code>*zamm* mathematics, not advisors</code> might get you results more in line with technical materials while excluding those about cloud migration companies (Zamm Advisors).</p></li>
<li><em class="italic">Site-specific search</em>: Sometimes, you will know that what you’re searching for can be found on a given site, but you might not be sure where specifically. In such cases, Google allows you to search specific sites by prepending <code>site:</code> to your search query. For example, to search the popular movie database site IMDB for information about the movie Predator, you could search for <code>site:imdb.com predator</code>. As a web developer, searching GitHub specifically is a common thing you’ll do when looking for an example of how to do something in code, so <code>site:github.com</code> is one to keep in mind.</li>
<li><em class="italic">File type search</em>: Although somewhat less common, Google, and other search engines, also allow you to search for specific document types. If you’re looking for a PDF, you can prepend the search query with <code>filetype:</code> to search for PDFs. For example, you can find some chapters of one of my books about Flutter by searching for <code>filetype:pdf </code><code>zammetti flutter</code>.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Time-based filters</em>: Most search engines offer the ability to limit your results to a specific timeframe. In Google, it’s under the <strong class="bold">Tools</strong> menu that you should see below the search box after you do a search. Here, you can request results from just the past week <a id="_idIndexMarker956"/>or month, for example. This can be immensely helpful when you’re looking up information about a recent security exploit, for example.</li>
</ul>
<p>Being able to search for answers quickly and efficiently via a search engine such as Google is something you can practice. To do so, just think of a topic, and start trying some searches. As a general rule, if you have to look down past the fifth or tenth search result, then you probably could improve the search query. After a while, you’ll tend to find that the first couple<a id="_idIndexMarker957"/> of results will generally contain what you need; otherwise, it’ll tell you that your search query wasn’t quite good enough. This is a general rule and there will always be exceptions, but I’ve found it to be true the vast majority of the time when you’re crafting good queries. Keep working on queries that don’t give you the results you need quickly by making them more specific.</p>
<p>That’s another general rule: start with a more general query and only start to make it more specific if you aren’t getting what you need. This strategy will help you not miss good results by being overly specific. However, one big exception to this rule is if you are researching a specific error message. In that case, I would encourage you to copy the entire error message and search for it literally (though I would always start with no quotes in it). It’s exceedingly rare that you will be the first person to have encountered a specific error message, so you’re likely to get a satisfactory answer in the first one to three results.</p>
<p>Search engines are<a id="_idIndexMarker958"/> now also integrating AI into their results. For example, at the time of writing, Google will usually show you a generative AI experiment section above the usual search results. These results tend to be very good for certain types of searches. For example, <code>how do I sort an array in Javascript</code> is likely to get you a good result, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 10</em><em class="italic">.1</em>), primarily because generative AI tends to work better when you ask a question naturally as opposed to just searching for a collection of keywords as you might tend to do with a straight web search:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 10.1: An example of a Google search that yields immediately useful results" src="img/B18315_10_1.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.1: An example of a Google search that yields immediately useful results</p>
<p>These days, my strategy is <a id="_idIndexMarker959"/>to always start with a literal question, written as if I were asking it of another human being, and see if the AI results are good. If not, only then do I move on to looking at the web search results. And even then, writing a literal question often yields better results. In my experience, it comes down to how common a question it is. For example, <code>how do I sort an array in JavaScript</code> is a common question developers ask, and so, AI results aside, you’re highly likely to get a good first web search result.</p>
<p>If I find that I’m not getting good results with that approach either, only then do I shift to a more keyword-centric strategy. So, I might try searching for <code>sort array javascript</code> instead in this example. And, of course, I start looking further down the list of results, though the quality of them tends to drop off after the first few regardless.</p>
<p>Of course, as you use search engines more and more, one thing you’ll start to realize is that a lot of the best results come from a handful of common sites. These are what I term<a id="_idIndexMarker960"/> the <strong class="bold">most value player</strong> (<strong class="bold">MVP</strong>) sites. These are sites geared toward us developers, or that provide a place for developers to congregate, so sometimes, it’s better to just go <a id="_idIndexMarker961"/>directly to these sites. But whether you get to them directly or via search results, they are good to know about, so let’s look at some of them now.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-264"><a id="_idTextAnchor264"/>Recognizing MVP sites</h1>
<p>There are many <a id="_idIndexMarker962"/>useful sites on the internet, many of which you’ll encounter on your web development journey, but I think there are two that especially stand above the rest – <strong class="bold">Stack Overflow</strong> (<strong class="bold">SO</strong>) and <strong class="bold">Mozilla Developer Network</strong> (<strong class="bold">MDN</strong>). You’ll probably find that a lot of your time – and a lot of your search results – leads to them, so let’s take a look at them both here.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-265"><a id="_idTextAnchor265"/>SO</h2>
<p>SO (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com">stackoverflow.com</a>) has <a id="_idIndexMarker963"/>quickly become a central part of<a id="_idIndexMarker964"/> the landscape for developers the world over. Launched in 2008 by two gentlemen named Jeff Arwood and Joel Spolsky, it presents a question-and-answer format to its users, specifically developers, to ask and answer questions about software development and related topics.</p>
<p>Having been around for several years and built up content over that period, it is now something of a database with all sorts of developer knowledge contained in it. That’s why search engine results for software development-related searches will so often land there. But it’s still a very active site on its own which you can use independent of search engines.</p>
<p>Once you go to SO and create a free account, you’ll be able to ask questions in various categories and with various tags to identify what it’s about, and then sit back and wait for people to answer! And here’s the best part: as you answer questions, you gain reputation points, which incentivizes people to answer. While not particularly common in my experience, being able to say you have a high reputation score on SO can sometimes look pretty good to people during an interview, so it’s worth answering questions when you feel ready to.</p>
<p>In addition, both questions and answers get voted on by the SO community. With more upvotes to questions comes more visibility, which usually means more answers, and upvotes help answers earn more reputation for their writers. All of this leads to a community-based moderation such that “good” questions and answers get raised, in a sense, while “bad” questions and answers get pushed down (less reputation, possibly less occurrence<a id="_idIndexMarker965"/> in <a id="_idIndexMarker966"/>search results, and so on).</p>
<p><em class="italic">Figure 10</em><em class="italic">.2</em> shows an example of an SO question and an answer to it. Notice how the site isn’t anything fancy, which is nice because it keeps the focus on the content, which is what matters. From this screenshot, you can see that this question has received five answers, one of which has gotten nine upvotes. This question was accepted by the person who asked it, as denoted by the checkmark below the vote counts. I’ll talk about this shortly, but take note of the answer and how the person provides several alternatives, with nicely formatted and explained (via comments) code. This is what I would deem a “good” answer:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 10.2: SO, in all its glory" src="img/B18315_10_2.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.2: SO, in all its glory</p>
<p>This all naturally<a id="_idIndexMarker967"/> leads to the very fair question of what constitutes <a id="_idIndexMarker968"/>a “good” and “bad” question and answer. Being community-driven, there are no hard-and-fast rules. You’re always kind of subject to the whims of the other developers that<a id="_idIndexMarker969"/> make up the<a id="_idIndexMarker970"/> community. But there are some general guidelines to keep in mind.</p>
<h3>Asking good questions</h3>
<p>First, before you<a id="_idIndexMarker971"/> even ask a question, be sure to take some time trying to find a suitable answer on SO. As I mentioned earlier, you’ll rarely be the first person to encounter a given situation, so there’s a fair chance what you intend to ask has already been answered. It’s not at all uncommon on SO to post a question and immediately get a (not especially polite) answer that it’s a duplicate of an existing question. Try to avoid that if you can by finding that answer on your own, whether through Google or directly searching within SO itself.</p>
<p>Next, when asking a question, it should come as no surprise that being friendly is an effective way to start. Simple things like “Hi! I’m having a problem with <em class="italic">X</em> and would appreciate any help I can get on it” helps you come across as someone people want to assist. Don’t come across like you’re entitled to answers – that’s it in a nutshell.</p>
<p>As you get answers, even if some aren’t helpful or even downright rude (which, fair warning, some will be), continue to be professional, patient, and polite. Developers can sometimes be a blunt group of people, but that doesn’t mean they are being mean or aren’t legitimately trying to help. Give them the benefit of the doubt, expand on the question if needed, and provide additional information, always while being polite. Of course, if you do run into people who just seem to want to make you have a difficult day, ignoring them is perfectly acceptable and probably the best thing to do in such situations.</p>
<p>After that, it’s important to show that you’ve done some work. Questions like “I’m trying to get my app to run in Tomcat but it’s not working, it’s giving me some error, please help,” is a sure way to get ignored, or downvoted. Instead, spell out what you’ve tried so far to resolve the issue, and provide as much detail as possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>What error specifically did you get?</li>
<li>What were you specifically trying to do when it happened?</li>
<li>Where did you research to try and find an answer yourself?</li>
<li>Failing that, what did you try on your own before deciding you needed help?</li>
</ul>
<p>People on SO really tend not to like it when someone asking a question seemingly hasn’t tried to resolve it themselves, so you want to make it clear that you have, and that means providing details.</p>
<p>Do your best to isolate the problem too. In other words, try to remove as much from the problem as possible so it’s focused as best you can. If you have a piece of code that isn’t working, try to remove any code that you are certain works and that isn’t necessary to understand the problem code. Developers rarely need to see one hundred different functions to figure out why one isn’t working right, so don’t spam the question with a lot of extraneous content.</p>
<p>Also, be sure to spell out the precise result you’re looking for and write a good, clear, but as concise as possible title for the post. The title should clearly describe the problem in as few words as possible. For example, “Help, JavaScript problem” is too generic to be of value, but “JavaScript array sort not resulting in properly sorted array” is much more specific and isn’t overly long either. Also, ensure you’re only really asking one question per post; otherwise, things can get very confusing and not very helpful in a hurry.</p>
<p>As the answers start to roll in, you may need to engage a bit to get what you need. That might mean clarifying your question, or providing more information as requested. Remember that SO is a dialogue between you and the people willing to help. Sometimes, you’ll get precisely what you need immediately; other, times you may need to go through some back-and-forth to get there. And, of course, fight the urge to get frustrated if it takes a<a id="_idIndexMarker972"/> while or you ultimately don’t get an answer. Keep in mind that these are people who are giving their time and energy to try and help you, so even if they give you wrong answers, don’t hold it against them. It’s all but certain they didn’t do it on purpose! Just roll with it and remember that even a wrong answer can sometimes be helpful, might even get you to see something you didn’t before, and find the answer as a result.</p>
<p>Lastly, when you do find good answers, be sure to upvote them, and be sure to accept correct answers that help you solve your problem. This is important to keep the reputation system working and keep providing incentives for people to help each other. Some people are on SO a lot specifically to answer as many questions as possible to get their reputation as high as possible, while others will just be occasional visitors who will help when they can. Either way, you want to ensure they get credit for helping you so that they’ll be more inclined to help others – and maybe that’s you again!  – next time too.</p>
<p>One final thing I’ll mention is that just the simple act of writing a good question on SO can help you discover the answer on your own! I can’t tell you how many times I’ve spent 20 minutes writing up a question, and halfway in I realized what the answer was. This happens in the same way that rubber duck debugging does. Rubber duck debugging is when a developer – sometimes very literally – talks through a problem to a rubber duck. Yes, a real, physical, rubber duck like kids often play with in the bathtub! It sounds weird and silly, I know, but the simple act of explaining a problem, talking through what you’ve tried to resolve it, and detailing what you think could be the problem is all it takes to unblock your brain and have that “eureka!” moment you need. So, whether you get yourself an actua<a id="_idIndexMarker973"/>l rubber duck, or just type a question on SO that you ultimately don’t even post, sometimes that alone will get the job done, weird as it seems!</p>
<h3>Giving good answers</h3>
<p>Of course, asking<a id="_idIndexMarker974"/> good questions is only half the equation. Especially early in your web developer journey, it’s the position you’ll find yourself in most of the time. But eventually, you may find your confidence and experience at a point where you’ll want to answer some questions. You might even find that you can answer some early on because you just so happen to have encountered something someone else is not struggling with. Either way, providing good answers is important to making SO work.</p>
<p>Ensure your answers are direct. You’ll often find answers that are generally good but go off on tangents about why this technology or design choice isn’t ideal – this isn’t always bad, and sometimes it’s very necessary to answer a given question, but sometimes, it’s just someone stating an unsolicited opinion and it has no real benefit to the person asking the question. So, stay focused on providing a specific answer to the specific question asked as much as possible.</p>
<p>When answering questions, always remember that not all developers are on the same level. Some are just starting, some have much more experience than you, and all the stops on the spectrum in between those two. Try to avoid assumptions, and always remain polite. Be respectful and professional at all times no matter what happens. To be sure, you may sometimes get a reply like “No, that’s wrong, I tried that, do better next time” or something rude like that. Just ignore it rather than start a flame war with someone (even though they kind of would deserve it with a reply like that!). It’s just not worth the time and energy you’ll waste.</p>
<p>When answering, you want to be as clear and concise as possible, and what can help there is giving simple examples. Sometimes, a simple example is worth a thousand words. You’ll also want to explain your solution in as simplistic terms as possible. Again, don’t make assumptions about what others know – explain every little thing as if you’re sure they don’t know it.</p>
<p>Be sure to cite references where appropriate. This is a fantastic way to help others learn by showing information sources they may not have been aware of and allowing them to learn beyond the horizon of the question they asked without coming across as pushy. They may get the answer you gave, but then go read the documentation you used to arrive at it and learn other things they didn’t think of in the process.</p>
<p>Finally, while I’ve said this several times, I think it’s important enough to say once more: whether asking or answering questions, no matter how your interactions go, always take the high road! SO sometimes gets a reputation for toxic interactions, but if you keep things positive, I think you’ll find those are very rare (and they will then be easy to ignore when and if they<a id="_idIndexMarker975"/> do happen). Remember that SO is a village, a bunch of people interacting and working together. As with any village, there are probably some not-so-pleasant people floating around that you might run into. Do everything you can to never be one of them yourself and I believe you’ll find SO a valuable resource.</p>
<p>Of course, SO is a social environment where you interact with other people. That isn’t the only choice, though. Another way you’ll often get answers is just by reading documentation on various sites. As a web developer specifically, though, there’s probably one site that you’ll find yourself on more times than not, and that’s the MDN. So, let’s talk about that now.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-266"><a id="_idTextAnchor266"/>MDN</h2>
<p>MDN or MDN <a id="_idIndexMarker976"/>Web Docs, as it’s sometimes called, is one of the <a id="_idIndexMarker977"/>most comprehensive resources for web developers. The site offers reference documentation, tutorials, examples, and guides for all things web technologies. It’s a very respected source of information. You can find MDN here: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org">https://developer.mozilla.org</a>. In <em class="italic">Figure 10</em><em class="italic">.3</em>, I’ve selected a JavaScript object to show some reference material for it:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 10.3: MDN" src="img/B18315_10_3.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.3: MDN</p>
<p>Some of the<a id="_idIndexMarker978"/> highlights<a id="_idIndexMarker979"/> of MDN are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic">Documentation</em>: MDN is well-known for its thorough documentation. It covers the main web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but also covers other topics in web development such as important protocols, web extensions for browsers, and accessibility. The content is incredibly detailed and well-organized, and it includes tons of examples. All of this makes it a valuable resource for both beginners and experienced developers.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Community-driven</em>: While not a social site like SO, MDN is its community-driven nature nonetheless. Both professional developers and volunteers from around the world contribute to its content regularly but in a more formal way than a site such as SO. This helps to ensure that the information presented is both accurate and up to date at all times and takes the latest web standards and best practices into account. The MDN maintainers work closely with web standards bodies such as<a id="_idIndexMarker980"/> the <strong class="bold">World Wide Web Consortium</strong> (<strong class="bold">W3C</strong>) and the <strong class="bold">Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group</strong> (<strong class="bold">WHATWG</strong>) to <a id="_idIndexMarker981"/>help ensure that the documentation reflects the most current web standards.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Tutorials and guides</em>: While MDN provides a wealth of reference material, it goes beyond that by providing tutorials and learning paths for those new to web development or<a id="_idIndexMarker982"/> looking to expand their skills. These<a id="_idIndexMarker983"/> resources are designed to be practical and easy to follow and to give you the knowledge and skills you need, so you can consider it not just a reference site but also a learning site.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Accessibility and internationalization</em>: MDN emphasizes web accessibility information, helping to ensure that the web content you build using the information it provides is accessible to people with disabilities (we discussed accessibility in <a href="B18315_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor129"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>). It also offers content in multiple languages, reflecting its global user base.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Compatibility and browser support</em>: MDN includes detailed information on browser compatibility for different web features, which is crucial for developers aiming to create cross-platform web applications. With it, you can ensure that a given feature will work across a range of browsers as you expect it to, maximizing the audience for the sites you build.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Dev tools</em>: MDN also provides guides and references for browser dev tools. This helps developers debug and optimize their code by exploring ways the dev tools can be used.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Open-source and free</em>: MDN is an open-source resource, and its content is available for free. This is thanks to Mozilla’s mission to keep the internet open and accessible. Their most well-known product, the Firefox browser, is a primary example of this goal, but MDN isn’t far behind!</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike SO, MDN isn’t a social site. There isn’t the sort of interaction with other developers there that you’ll experience with SO. But it’s one of the absolute best sites you can bookmark to use as a source of reference material available. It is highly accurate, always up to date, and just generally reliable in every way that matters.</p>
<p>Another consideration when we talk about things you can do as a developer to be successful is the judicious use of various tools that help you write better code. IDEs are of course one of those, but<a id="_idIndexMarker984"/> there are also standalone tools (which<a id="_idIndexMarker985"/> can also usually be integrated into your IDE as well) that can examine your code and help you make it better. We’ll talk about some of those next.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-267"><a id="_idTextAnchor267"/>Tooling around – other tools to know about and use</h1>
<p>When you write <a id="_idIndexMarker986"/>code, it’s you against the machine. You write your code, you run it, you see what it does or doesn’t do right, and you debug it. You do this over and over again until it’s working as expected. You mold that clay, in digital form!</p>
<p>But there’s almost always something you could do to make it better. Unless the code is small and trivial, that tends to be the case. Maybe there are still bugs in it that you just haven’t discovered. Maybe there are things you could do to make it perform better. Maybe there are security issues that will only be problems in certain very specific situations (which, unfortunately, threat actors are very good at finding). Or, maybe it’s simply not formatted as consistently as it could be.</p>
<p>In all these cases, you don’t have to go it alone! Some tools can help you write better code. They fall into three broad<a id="_idIndexMarker987"/> categories: <strong class="bold">static code analysis</strong> (<strong class="bold">SCA</strong>) tools, linters, and stylers. There is significant overlap between these, and often, you’ll hear developers just talking about “static analysis tools” in a general way, but there are enough differences to create these three broad categories.</p>
<p>Regardless of the category, though, they involve tools that analyze your code, report issues, and give you recommendations. Being a professional developer will almost certainly involve using these tools. And even if you wind up working somewhere that doesn’t make use of these tools generally, you, as a good developer, should do so on your own regardless <a id="_idIndexMarker988"/>because they really can bring a lot of benefits to your work.</p>
<p>Let’s start by talking about SCA tools, which are probably the broadest and most fungible of the categories.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-268"><a id="_idTextAnchor268"/>SCA tools</h2>
<p>The purpose of SCA<a id="_idIndexMarker989"/> tools is to analyze source code without <a id="_idIndexMarker990"/>actually executing it, alerting you to problems you may not see on your own.</p>
<p>These types of tools typically run from a command line, where you simply tell it where your source code is and it will go off and do its thing. Some of them have GUIs to make using them a little easier. Most can be integrated into your IDE and executed from there.</p>
<p>In addition, it’s not at all uncommon to find these tools integrated into a CI/CD pipeline, and sometimes in drastic ways. For example, it’s often the case that the build will fail, alerting the entire development team if any SCA failure occurs. This helps to ensure that the code is in good shape before it’s pushed out and deployed for people to see, whether to a development environment or even to production.</p>
<h3>Popular examples</h3>
<p>While far from an<a id="_idIndexMarker991"/> exhaustive list, which will be true of all of these categories where I give examples, some of the more widely-known SCA tools are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">SonarQub</strong>: A widely used tool that looks for all sorts of problems with code. It can point out, for example, places where your code may fail given specific inputs, as well as places where your code doesn’t properly encode output and therefore can result in a security exploit. It supports the notion of quality gates, which are rules that you can set that determine whether a review passes or fails. Since it can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines, the build can fail based on these gates if configured to do so. While SonarQube is generally seen as a very good tool, it can be a bit more complex to set up and use.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Veracode</strong>: Veracode is similar to SonarQube but is focused almost exclusively on security issues. It is cloud-based, which tends to make it easier to use that SonarQube. It is often as easy as uploading your source code and clicking a button. You’ll get back a report that details its findings, complete with links directly to the source code. It can not only detect problems in your code but can also point out dependencies you may be using that themselves have known exploits. Veracode also offers a dynamic analysis option, which means it can scan your code at runtime, which allows it to detect flaws that can’t be detected statically.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Coverity</strong>: This tool is known for its advanced static analysis capabilities, particularly in detecting security vulnerabilities. It claims to test every line of code and potential execution path, and then state the root cause of each defect clearly, making it easy to fix problems. Some of the types of problems it can detect include resource leaks (when your code doesn’t properly clean up after itself and wastes things like memory), use of uninitialized data (a very common flaw that often leads to security vulnerabilities), and control flow issues (when the logic of your code can lead to code being executed that you don’t intend to).</li>
</ul>
<p>While some offer <a id="_idIndexMarker992"/>more robust capabilities, all of these can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines, and also IDEs, though the capabilities provided in each case can differ significantly. For example, while Veracode can be integrated into your IDE and report problems immediately, the capabilities are a bit limited since the cloud hosting model means the full capabilities of Veracode can’t run on your machine. This is just something to keep in mind when using these tools.</p>
<p>In addition, and again with some variety in their level of support, all of these tools support multiple programming languages and technology stacks. Other tools target specific languages (FindBugs, for example, is a Java-only SCA), so it’s important to research each tool to determine if it will meet your technology needs.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that using these tools will help you detect problems early and in most cases before your<a id="_idIndexMarker993"/> code is deployed or run. This means your output will be more solid and robust, and that’s the ultimate goal.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-269"><a id="_idTextAnchor269"/>Linters</h2>
<p><strong class="bold">Linters</strong> perform <a id="_idIndexMarker994"/>much the same function as SCA tools but at a somewhat different level. While <a id="_idIndexMarker995"/>the analysis done by SCA tools can be very in-depth, linters tend to not go as deeply into the code. SCA tools will normally go deeper by, in a sense, executing your code – not literally, but in the sense that they can analyze the code and determine how data will flow through it, thereby finding deep flaws in the code.</p>
<p>Linters, by contrast, look for specific patterns, known constructs that tend to lead to errors, as well as code that doesn’t adhere to established standards. This means that linters tend to be much faster than SCA tools, which means using them regularly is much less intrusive. SCA tools, by contrast, can often take significant time to perform their analysis. Linters can find security issues just like SCA tools can, but they do so at a higher level.</p>
<p>In essence, think of linters as tools that look at your code more or less as text, looking for specific patterns that may indicate an issue, whereas SCA tools are more like you as a programmer when debugging in that you’re walking through the code in your head.</p>
<p>Linters help maintain a consistent coding style, making the code more readable and maintainable, based on rules you set. Again, this is just about pattern recognition: a linter can tell you if you forget to put a semicolon on the end of a line if you’ve configured its rules to tell you that, for example.</p>
<p>Linters are almost always language-specific as a result since the variations across different programming languages tend to lead to different patterns to look for.</p>
<h3>Popular examples</h3>
<p>Here are a few popular <a id="_idIndexMarker996"/>examples of linters:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">ESLint</strong>: This is a linter for JavaScript. It is highly configurable in that you can determine the rules it should use at a very fine-grained level. It supports the latest Javascript standards, which helps to ensure your code is written in a modern, robust way.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Pylint</strong>: This linter is a popular one for Pythion. It is flexible, similar to how ESLint is, and can find all sorts of bugs and code smells (bits of code that developers tend to view as, while not being outright bugs, things that typically shouldn’t be done a given way).</li>
<li><strong class="bold">CheckStyle</strong>: A popular linter for Java. It primarily focuses on code style and formatting, not so much on error detection, though there is some of that in it as well. It is highly <a id="_idIndexMarker997"/>configurable, though that configuration can be somewhat complex.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-270"><a id="_idTextAnchor270"/>Stylers</h2>
<p>While linters will point out problems in code, they don’t touch the code. This is true of SCA tools as well. The<a id="_idIndexMarker998"/> other class of tools is stylers (sometimes called formatters), and these<a id="_idIndexMarker999"/> very much do touch your code. They can automatically format source code to a particular style guide, ensuring consistency across even an entire codebase. Unlike linters, they don’t just flag issues but also reformat the code to meet the specified guidelines.</p>
<p><strong class="bold">Stylers</strong> tend to be straightforward to use and often configurable to fit team-specific styles and rules. However, they can also be dangerous. I don’t mean dangerous in terms of anything being broken – I don’t recall ever seeing a styler break code – but dangerous in the sense that it can alter the structure of code very quickly. If you didn’t set the rules right, then you’ll probably wind up having a cleanup task on your hands (which, hopefully, just means altering the rules and re-running the styler, but that may not always work).</p>
<p>Stylers are all about maintaining consistent, appropriate formatting and styling of code, but I have to caution you against relying on them. Many developers believe they can write code any way they want because they know they will run a styler on it when they’re done, at which point it will have the correct styling. In my experience, this is a poor way to work.</p>
<p>My wife, a trained chef, always impresses upon me when we prepare a meal together that a true professional chef will clean up as they go. They don’t simply make a big mess as they’re cooking and then clean it up at the end. They are constantly cleaning up their station because that leads to fewer mistakes (you don’t want to cut yourself because you slipped on a messy station) and more consistent results. I’ve come to view coding in the same way.</p>
<p>I’ve seen developers write code where sometimes, they indent with two spaces and sometimes with four. Sometimes, they put braces on the end of a line and sometimes alone on the next line. To be sure, the code doesn’t care – it’ll work just fine either way. But this sloppiness leads to more mistakes just because inconsistency tends to make code harder to follow, which is why we care about it at all.</p>
<p>I believe that like a professional chef, a professional developer cleans up as they go. For us, that means writing well-formatted and most importantly consistently-formatted code <em class="italic">as you go</em>. Yes, you should use a styler at the end to catch any mistakes you’ve made because, after all, none of us are perfect. But to put it simply: you want that styler to do as little as possible! There should be little for it to change in your code because you’ve already styled it properly yourself in effect. Make this a habit, something you do without thinking, and<a id="_idIndexMarker1000"/> it won’t<a id="_idIndexMarker1001"/> get in the way of your work at all. I would argue it’ll make you more efficient since your brain won’t have to deal with the inconsistency of your work as you debug.</p>
<h3>Popular examples</h3>
<p>Some popular stylers that you might encounter are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Prettier</strong>: One <a id="_idIndexMarker1002"/>of the most widely adopted stylers, it supports many languages and integrates with most IDEs and even plain old text editors. It normally takes nothing more than pressing a key combination and your code will be reformatted instantly. While Prettier is configurable, it’s a bit limited in this area purposely. Instead, Prettier is what we call an <em class="italic">opinionated</em> tool. By default, it uses a set of sensible and common settings, the goal being that you shouldn’t have to configure it at all.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Black</strong>: A well-known Python styler, it is known for its uncompromising approach to formatting Python code. It is even more opinionated than Prettier and therefore has fewer configuration options. So long as you like the style it provides, it’s excellent and will work for you immediately with almost no setup cost.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Gofmt</strong>: Gofmt is the de facto standard for formatting code written in the Go languages. It is used almost universally by Go developers. It implements the Go community coding standards and offers comparatively few configuration options. However, it is extremely fast and very widely adopted, and it’s almost certainly what you’ll use if you do any Go development.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be they SCA tools, linters, or stylers, incorporating these tools into your daily workflow can significantly enhance code quality and maintainability, as well as reduce bug counts. Integrating them into your development workflow, including CI/CD pipelines, can streamline code reviews, enhance team collaboration, and enforce coding standards (which is something developers otherwise almost enjoy fighting about!). They are particularly beneficial in larger projects or teams, ensuring a unified code base despite multiple contributors.</p>
<p>Of course, there isn’t <a id="_idIndexMarker1003"/>a tool for everything. Sometimes, it all comes down to you and your brain and how you use it. Well, to be more specific, it <strong class="bold">always</strong> does! Let’s look at some aspects of that now.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-271"><a id="_idTextAnchor271"/>Using the best tool of all – you!</h2>
<p>The sorts of tools we’ve<a id="_idIndexMarker1004"/> been discussing all have the explicit purpose of making your code better in some way, be that more error-free, formatted well, or anything else. And these tools are fantastic and definitely should be used. But there’s one that you should be using at all times, and that’s you – you and your brain!</p>
<p>The best developers won’t rely on the tools discussed; instead, they will use them as backup because all along they will have been writing clean, solid code. No one is perfect, of course, which is why we need these tools to be watching over our backs, so to speak, to catch what we miss. But if we’re doing things right, then there should be very little for these tools to catch anyway because we will, out of habit, have been writing our code with proper formatting all along, and with solid development principles all along.</p>
<p>But one other thing you’ll want to keep in mind is commenting code because while these tools can point out places you haven’t commented well, to some extent, this is by and large an area you have to do yourself because generally speaking, the machine doesn’t know what you’re thinking (some of the new AI-based tooling is starting to change this, but we’re still in early days of that, so it’s better to develop good habits yourself).</p>
<p>Documenting our code is very important, and that’s where writing comments in that code comes into play. In your career, you will undoubtedly meet developers who will tell you that commenting code isn’t necessary if it is “self-documenting.” What do they mean by this?</p>
<p>What they mean is that code should be written clearly and “obviously,” and part of that is good naming. For example, take a look at this code:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
const ac = getAc("zammetti");</pre> <p>What does that do? Well, you can tell that the <code>getAc()</code> function will return… something. And it’ll be stored in the <code>ac</code> variable. That’s all obvious. But what does <code>getAc()</code> return? And what is the <code>ac</code> variable hold?</p>
<p>You could rewrite this code in a much clearer way:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
const checkingAccount = getCheckingAccountFromLastName("Zammetti");</pre> <p>Now, it’s obvious what’s going on because the name of the variable and the name of the function spell out – by their very names – what they’re for. There’s no guesswork. That’s what is meant by<a id="_idIndexMarker1005"/> self-documenting code: naming things in such a way that they convey information about their purpose.</p>
<p>However, even when you do that, there is information that can’t be properly conveyed by just good variable and function names. That’s where comments in the code come into play. As I mentioned, there is a fair bit of debate about commenting in code, with some developers preferring as little as possible, while others would argue that there should be more comments than actual code in your code!</p>
<p>In my experience, the best answer falls somewhere in the middle. One key tenet to keep in mind is that comments should explain the <em class="italic">why</em> of the code, not the <em class="italic">what</em>. In other words, you shouldn’t comment on every line of code explaining what it does because – assuming it’s written clearly, as described previously – the line tells you what it does anyway. The code itself is the what, so don’t do this:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
// Get the checking account.
const checkingAccount = getCheckingAccuntFromLastName("Zammetti");
// Increment its transaction count.
checkingAccount.transactionCount++;
// Create a transaction.
const transaction = new Transaction();
// Add a credit.
Transaction.credit(100);
// Add transaction to account.
account.addTransaction(transaction);
// Save the updated account back to the database.
account.saveToDatabase();</pre> <p>Instead, I would suggest that a better way to comment this code might be as follows:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
// Add a transaction to the account and update it in the database.
const checkingAccount = getCheckingAccuntFromLastName("Zammetti");
checkingAccount.transactionCount++;
const transaction = new Transaction();
Transaction.credit(100);
account.addTransaction(transaction);
account.saveToDatabase();</pre> <p>While similar<a id="_idIndexMarker1006"/> information is conveyed, the combination of well-named variables and functions plus some judicious comments is sufficient. If you also have a blank line after the <code>saveToDatabase()</code> call before starting the next action, then the single comment has the benefit of logically grouping the lines. You can easily tell those six lines of code are related to updating the account, and the comment acts as a signpost for them.</p>
<p>But even that comment might not truly be necessary (except for the aforementioned signpost) because it doesn’t explain <em class="italic">why</em> the code exists. Why are we adding a transaction and updating the account? The why of things is where comments come to earn their keep. Explaining how parts of the code work together is ripe for commenting. Describing any gotchas that might be in the code – that’s worth commenting.</p>
<p>For example, you might write a comment above that <code>getCheckingAccountFromLastName()</code> function - something along the lines of this:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
/**
 * Perform a SQL database query against the MASTER accounts
 * table to find a checking account based on a last name.
 * The account will consist of the basic account details,
 * as well as extended transaction data as a sub-object.
 * Note that an exception is never thrown, an Account
 * object will ALWAYS be returned.  Used by the account
 * list screen, as well as the processing subsystem.
 *
 * @param  inLastName The last name to return an account
                      for.
 * @return            An Account object.  If inLastName is
                      null, return an empty Account object.
                      If no account is found for the last
                      name, return an Account object with
                      an account number of -1 and all
                      other fields empty.
 */</pre> <p>Don’t focus on <a id="_idIndexMarker1007"/>the syntax because that differs from language to language (this is for Java). But more importantly, here, you can see a detailed description of the function, as well as some details that might aid future developers (which may well be you!). You can also see what arguments it accepts, what it returns, and some conditions on its operation.</p>
<p>One of the reasons some developers say that commenting is to be avoided is because “the comments lie.” What they mean is that if you modify that function such that it will return <code>null</code> rather than an empty <code>Account</code> object when <code>inLastName</code> is <code>null</code> – a change that might be necessary for some reason later – if you don’t update the comment along with the code then the comment will, in fact, “lie.” It tells you to expect an empty <code>Account</code> object when <code>inLastName</code> is <code>null</code>, but that’s no longer the case.</p>
<p>While some say you can avoid this by not writing comments, which is undoubtedly true, it’s not a good answer. Instead, the right way to solve that problem is to treat comments as being just as important as the code. When you change the code, get in the habit of changing the comment too. Some developers will update the comment first to, in a sense, give themselves a guideline for the work they’re about to do. Either way, don’t treat comments as an afterthought and you’ll tend not to wind up with “lying” comments.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, get into the habit of commenting more, not less, but also keep an eye out for superfluous comments. If you find yourself commenting more about what is happening rather than why, then you’re probably taking it too far, and it also may indicate that you haven’t written your code in a self-documenting way (because why would you need so many comments if the code didn’t make things obvious already?)</p>
<p>But I can tell you, as someone who has had to deal with large volumes of code that had little to no comments, I will take an overly-verbosely-commented code base over one with sparse comments any day of the week, no matter how self-documenting it’s written. Even bad comments are like bad pizza: it’s still pretty good! Ultimately, it’s all about balance. Too much commenting that isn’t useful can just get in the way, but not enough is just as bad. Shoot for the middle ground.</p>
<p>Besides<a id="_idIndexMarker1008"/> commenting and having good habits, another aspect of using your brain is the fact that in this line of work, a lot of the time, you’ll need that brain to work on more than one thing at a time. Let’s get into what that means.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-272"><a id="_idTextAnchor272"/>Multitasking (like a CPU on the wind!)</h1>
<p>The CPU in your<a id="_idIndexMarker1009"/> computer is an amazing technical achievement. A gentleman by the name of Ben Driscoll said it best in a tweet one time: “If you ever code something that feels like a hack, but it works, just remember that a CPU is literally a rock that we tricked into thinking.”</p>
<p>What’s perhaps most amazing about it is how it can (seemingly) do many things at once. When you’re using Windows, OSX, or a Linux-based desktop, you can have many windows opened at once with many different programs running at the same time. While the CPU isn’t the only thing responsible for that, it’s certainly a key part and it always blows my mind when I stop and think about it.</p>
<p>To a certain extent, as a web developer, you will have to act like a CPU, handling multiple tasks at once. Of course, a human being just can’t do quite as much at a single time as a CPU can, but the CPU is pulling a trick on you. You see, it’s not doing multiple things at once either (I admit I’m simplifying this a bit here to make the comparison work, but it’s true enough at a high level to work). Instead, what a CPU is doing is switching between many tasks very fast – so fast that the illusion of it all happening at the same time is maintained on a human timescale.</p>
<p>Web developers often have to work in the same general way. That’s because the outcome of one task will often feed another, but the process becomes cyclic, and therefore iterative.</p>
<p>For example, as you write the HTML and CSS for a website, you may realize that the images you prepared earlier won’t quite work as planned. As a result, you have to go back and redo them. You can choose to wait until you’re done with the coding and then redo the images – and sometimes that’s totally viable and probably the best way to go – but other times, redoing the images may then feed back into the HTML and CSS in some way that causes you to<a id="_idIndexMarker1010"/> have to tweak that now (maybe you decide that you need to put shadows on the images, which means you may have to go back and remove the CSS that also puts shadows on them).</p>
<p>Or it could be that as you write the code, you want to deploy it for your customers to see as you work. So, you have to alternate between coding and deploying.</p>
<p>What should be clear is that you have to do as a CPU does and switch between tasks. Hopefully, you don’t have to do it as fast as a CPU and not as regularly! Ideally, it’s usually better to complete one task before moving on to another as a human being. That’s not always possible, though.</p>
<p>If you suspect this can get stressful, then you are right, it definitely can be. So, how can you deal with that?</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-273"><a id="_idTextAnchor273"/>Keeping notes</h2>
<p>One thing that I find <a id="_idIndexMarker1011"/>helps me is to keep judicious notes about the tasks I’m working on. I’ll write down where I am on a given task every so often and record the steps I’ve already taken. I’ll also write down what I plan to do next, and what I think is required going forward.</p>
<p>The benefit of this is that when I have to switch to another task for a while and then come back to the first one, I’m not trying to recreate my entire mental model of the task from scratch. Instead, I have comments and outlines and maybe even simple diagrams to help me pick up where I left off faster.</p>
<p>I also tend to like to keep these notes somewhere I can access them all the time – my current choice is Google Keep, but you can use anything that lets you get to your information anywhere. I find this beneficial because sometimes you’ll have random, intrusive thoughts about a task during downtime, or during other tasks sometimes, and it’s helpful to be able to jot down notes about the thought in the same place all the other information about the task already is. That way, when I go back to the task, the thought is right there waiting for me (even if it immediately left my head after I wrote it down, which happens a lot!)</p>
<p>Keeping notes is good, but ultimately, you still have to switch between tasks and manage those tasks, and that can be stressful, notes or not. One part of that stress can come from poor time management. So, how do you manage the time allotted to each task in a way that <a id="_idIndexMarker1012"/>this at least has a chance to reduce stress? One approach that works pretty well is time-boxing.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-274"><a id="_idTextAnchor274"/>Time-boxing</h2>
<p><strong class="bold">Time-boxing</strong> (sometimes <a id="_idIndexMarker1013"/>called time-slicing) involves<a id="_idIndexMarker1014"/> defining how long it will take you to complete a task before<a id="_idIndexMarker1015"/> starting it and sticking to that limit no matter what.</p>
<p>Maybe you have to write some code, so you time-box that to an hour. Then, you go off and code for an hour. But if 20 minutes in you realize you have to modify your images, instead of switching tasks immediately, you continue coding until you either reach your hour time box limit or you finish earlier than that (which is always okay). Only then do you move on to the images, and again you would time-box that task as well.</p>
<p>There may be cases where you <em class="italic">have</em> to break out of a time box – if you simply can’t continue the code unless the images are right, for example – but in most situations, that tends to not be the case. Even tasks you discover as you work can usually wait until your current task is done. Of course, you may consider something you discover as you work to simply be part of the task at hand anyway, in which case your time box should still stand, but you alter the work you’re doing within it slightly.</p>
<p>One of the biggest problems people deal with as they work on a project, whether you effectively time-box tasks or not, is interruptions, usually from other people. As with a real CPU, which<a id="_idIndexMarker1016"/> can sometimes need to have its current task interrupted for something important, a human CPU faces this issue as well. How can you deal with that?</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-275"><a id="_idTextAnchor275"/>Deferring and Do Not Disturb</h2>
<p>The trick is to<a id="_idIndexMarker1017"/> defer any interruptions you<a id="_idIndexMarker1018"/> can in a way that comes across well to others. It also requires an awareness of the communication channel the interruption comes in on.</p>
<p>What I mean is that someone walking up to your desk and starting a conversation with you has a different immediacy to it than a text message, an instant message, or an email. The hope is that people use an appropriate communication channel, but they don’t always. If someone has a question that doesn’t require an immediate response for example, then an email is usually better than a phone call. If, on the other hand, they have a problem that is keeping them from continuing their work at all (what we usually call a <strong class="bold">blocker</strong>), then<a id="_idIndexMarker1019"/> they may have no choice but to come over to your desk and get your immediate attention.</p>
<p>What you have to be aware of is that unless the situation is severe, you have the option of deferring! You can simply say “I’m right in the middle of something at the moment, let me get back to you as soon as I free up.” Yes, if they perceive their need as being more immediate, then they may not take it quite as well as they otherwise would, but at some point, that becomes a “not my problem” situation for you. After all, you have work to get done, and that’s hard to do if you can’t focus on it because you have to help others.</p>
<p>Still, being the person who is recognized as always being helpful and the person who usually has the answers is a nice feeling, but it’s also difficult when factoring in the work you are doing. Constant context-switching can be a productivity killer when it’s unplanned. Therefore, when things get to a certain point, putting up a Do Not Disturb sign might be appropriate.</p>
<p>In an office environment, that could be a literal sign! If you have an office, then closing the door might be essentially what it is. Or when dealing with instant messaging systems such as Microsoft Teams, setting your status to Do Not Disturb for a while is a terrific way to get the focus time you need. Like I said earlier, being a go-to person has its benefits, but it <a id="_idIndexMarker1020"/>can’t <a id="_idIndexMarker1021"/>usually be without limits; otherwise, you’ll find your productivity sinking like a stone.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-276"><a id="_idTextAnchor276"/>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>So, at the end of<a id="_idIndexMarker1022"/> the day, as with a CPU, you have to expect and deal with context-switching as a web developer. It tends to be a pretty natural part of the job. But you have to do what you can to manage it. You won’t always be able to, but time-boxing and limiting or outright shutting down communication channels – true emergencies excepted – for a little while are some of the ways you can achieve that.</p>
<p>I like to take it as a bit of a challenge! I get interrupted <em class="italic">a lot</em> on the job because I’m one of those go-to people. So, every time it happens, I like to push myself to be as helpful as I can, as quickly as I can, and then see how fast I can get my work back on track. It almost becomes something of a game!</p>
<p>The final piece of advice I’d leave you with is that when you do inevitably see your productivity slip, take note of how you help others get their work done. Remember that as part of a team, it’s usually the output of the team as a whole that most matters. Therefore, even if you didn’t get a lot done yourself on a given day, realizing the work you helped others get done shows you how you <em class="italic">were</em> productive, just in a different way!</p>

<p>In this chapter, the <strong class="bold">Code Quality</strong> and <strong class="bold">Soft Skills</strong> boxes were revealed. Regarding soft skills, the next chapter is all about that, but a lot of what was discussed in this chapter can also be to, a degree, labeled soft skills. Certainly, attention to detail and multitasking would<a id="_idIndexMarker1024"/> fall into that category, so I felt it was appropriate to uncover here, even though the next chapter will dive deeper into that topic.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-278"><a id="_idTextAnchor278"/>Summary</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we discussed the key skill of paying attention to detail, and we looked at some ways you help you achieve that, to help you stay in the moment. We then looked at making effective use of search engines, and helpful websites where you can get information – especially help from other developers when needed.</p>
<p>Then, we looked at some common tools that developers use to ensure code quality including static analysis tools.</p>
<p>Finally, we talked about the idea of multitasking – as CPUs do – and how it’s almost inevitable that you’ll need to be able to shift gears often as a web developer to be effective. We also talked about strategies to help deal with the stress that can naturally come out of that context-switching.</p>
<p>Much of this discussion could be said to focus on “soft skills,” but in the next chapter, we’ll look at more traditional terms regarding soft skills – things such as interpersonal relationships, and communication skills. We’ll also talk about development methodologies a little bit, with a specific focus on something called the Agile methodology, since it’s so popular these days, and because to a large degree, it’s an exercise in soft skills to make it work!</p>
