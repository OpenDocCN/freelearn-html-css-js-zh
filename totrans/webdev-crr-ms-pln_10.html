<h1 id="_idParaDest-260"><a id="_idTextAnchor260"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">Discovering the Keys to Quality Work as a Web Developer</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">Learning to code and landing a web development position is all well and good, but once you do that, it’s time to start thinking about the things you can do to ensure you perform well. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">And not just perform well, but continue to improve your performance over time and help, if it’s what you want, to move up the corporate ladder </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">of success.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">I’m talking about things such as attention to detail, learning to use search engines and other online tools effectively, how to make effective use of developer tools that aren’t focused on producing code but rather ensuring the quality of the code you write, and your ability to multitask. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">These are things that anyone can learn and know, regardless of your level of experience, and that should become habits over time (even if you stop consciously thinking about them after </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">a while).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">These skills are important because the goal is to always be working at a high level of quality and always producing solid results, but without killing yourself to achieve it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">Your boss will want this of you, but if you take personal pride in your work, then it becomes (relatively) easy to make that </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">boss happy.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">So, in this chapter, we’ll cover the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">following topics:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">Sweating the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">small stuff</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">Exercising </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">your Google-Fu</span></span></li>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-261"><a id="_idTextAnchor261"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">Sweating the small stuff</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">You have probably heard </span><a id="_idIndexMarker947"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">the expression “Don’t sweat the small stuff.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.2">The idea here is to not let stress build by worrying about things that have a low impact, or that you can’t do much about. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.3">However, in earlier chapters, I made the point that attention to detail is a key attribute of a good developer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.4">“Sweating the small stuff,” as I like to say, is what web development is </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">all about.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">Having good attention to detail is an important skill to cultivate in yourself because while it’s obvious that big mistakes can lead to big problems, small oversights can sometimes snowball into significant issues as well, if not necessarily with the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">same immediacy.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">So, you </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">do</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1"> have to sweat the small stuff in this field, but the phrase, in this case, isn’t about managing stress – it’s about being as thorough and as accurate in your work as you can be, accounting for as much as you can, whether big or small. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">This is a crucial skill in producing work that is as robust, efficient, and bug-free </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">as possible.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">Scrutinizing code, thoughtfully considering system architecture, and ensuring your designs meet both current and future needs are the things we’re most interested in doing well and with proper attention </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">to detail.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">As an example, let’s say that you’re building a website that involves storing user information. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">This involves writing information to a relational database. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.3">You might decide that the key of your user table – the column that uniquely identifies a user – should be a combination of each person’s first and last names. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.4">This might seem reasonable at first, and in fact, it would work perfectly fine, at least for a while. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.5">But what happens if two people with the same first and last name – a situation that certainly can occur in the real world – try signing up? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.6">Due to a relatively small mistake in the database’s design, a new user can’t even register due to the name conflict. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.7">Or worse, the system could, depending on how the code is written, comingle the two people’s data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.8">Ironically, as I wrote these words, I’m dealing with a situation where my insurance company has somehow comingled my and my dad’s accounts precisely because we have the same first and last names. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.9">You wouldn’t think things like that happen for real, but you’d be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">very wrong!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">So, learning to pay attention to details is important. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">It can also be difficult because, especially early in your career, you won’t have much experience to base your observations on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.3">All you can do at that point is to try and think through various scenarios, game them out, and look for gotchas as best you can. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.4">Experience isn’t a guarantee of success, nor is it always needed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.5">Thinking logically – another point I’ve made a few times – is ultimately what it comes down to. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.6">Of course, the more experience you have, the better you will be able to think logically since you’ll have more information to base it on, but it’s not the be-all, end-all of attention </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">to detail.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">You also have to be a little bit careful if you focus too exclusively on the minutia of a project as you can sometimes lose the forest for the trees, as the saying goes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">You also always need to be mindful of the big picture and keep sight of the overall goals and objectives that the details work to achieve. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.3">Striking the right balance is what’s needed, and that primarily comes from practice. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.4">You’ve got to do these things and exercise these mental muscles to build them up properly </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">over time.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">When it comes to </span><a id="_idIndexMarker948"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">attention to detail, perhaps the most important consideration is focus, and how you can keep your mind pointed in the right direction, or to say it another way: staying in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">the moment.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-262"><a id="_idTextAnchor262"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">Staying in the moment</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">One trick that can</span><a id="_idIndexMarker949"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1"> help you achieve better attention to detail is “staying in the moment.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">It’s easy for all of us to become distracted by the various trials and tribulations of life – we all have things working in the back of our minds almost all the time, things we’re worried about or persistent problems we’re trying to solve – but the trick is to learn to push that stuff way back in your mind and focus on the here and now, on the main problem </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">at hand.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">If your mind is wandering or pre-occupied by things other than, for example, working on that database mentioned earlier – even if you don’t immediately realize it’s happening – you will often find your focus isn’t where it needs to be, and you’ll wind up missing details that could have led you to better decisions, such as the problem with the key of the database if you use names. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">The problem with the key may have occurred to you if you were fully focused on that design task and not allowing your mind to wander (there are never any guarantees of course, but you want to give yourself the best odds </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">at least).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">While staying in the moment is a general concept, there are some concrete steps you can take to help you achieve this – things we </span><a id="_idIndexMarker950"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">call </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">mindfulness exercises</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">These are practices that are designed to help bring your attention to the present moment and help you become more aware of your thoughts, feelings, and surroundings. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.3">They can be quite beneficial for improving focus, reducing stress, and enhancing </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">overall well-being.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">Specifically, here are some common mindfulness exercises you can </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">work on:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">Mindful breathing</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">: This is perhaps the most basic mindfulness exercise, but also can be the most useful. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.2">All it takes is to focus your attention on your breath. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.3">Notice the inhalation and exhalation, the rhythm of it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.4">It’s an autonomic function of your body, of course, something you rarely pay attention to (unless there’s a problem!), so focusing on it can be an interesting experience. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.5">When your mind inevitably wanders, gently bring it back to your breath, and re-focus on the moment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.6">This can be done anywhere at any time, even for just a few minutes, and can not only help you learn to focus on details but can also serve as a fantastic way to simply relax, which also tends to aid in attention </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">to detail.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">Body scan meditation</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">: This exercise might not fly in an office environment, but it’s something you can do at home. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.2">You simply lie down or sit in a comfortable chair and focus your attention slowly and deliberately on each part of your body, from your toes to </span><a id="_idIndexMarker951"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">the top of your head. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">You’re “scanning” your body, in other words. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.3">As you do, notice any sensations, tension, or discomfort in each part, and try to relax any tension </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">you notice.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">Mindful observation</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">: To do this exercise, choose an object in your vicinity – any object will do – and focus your mind on just observing it for a minute or two. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.2">Notice everything you can about it, observing it as if you’re seeing it for the first time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.3">If you happen to be near a window, finding a bird, squirrel, or other animal can be an especially enjoyable “object” to use for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">this exercise.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">Mindful listening</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">: Instead of focusing on an object as with mindful observation, this exercise involves listening to sounds in your environment, whether it’s the chirping of birds, the rustling of leaves, or </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">distant traffic.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">Mindful eating</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">: While this exercise probably isn’t something that will typically help you pay attention to detail during a given task, it’s an exercise that can hone your skill a bit by exercising it with a common example. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.2">This exercise involves paying full attention to the simple, everyday experience of eating! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.3">As you eat, take notice of the color, texture, and taste of your food. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.4">Chew slowly and be aware of the sensations and flavors in each bite. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.5">You can almost make a game of it! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.6">It will train your brain to focus more on the moment, getting it used to the sensation of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">doing so.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">Walking meditation</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">: In a similar vein, practice mindfulness while walking. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.2">This involves becoming aware of the sensation of your feet touching the ground, the rhythm of your steps, and your breathing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.3">Take note of the simple fact that your legs are moving more or less on their own! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.4">It’s kind of a weird thing to realize! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.5">Also, take care to see the sights, sounds, and smells around you as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">you walk.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">Mindful stretching or yoga</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">: Many people do yoga regularly, and for good reason: it can help focus the mind! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">Fortunately, it doesn’t require buying a proper yoga mat and finding a good yoga class in your town. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.3">Instead, you can sit in a comfortable position and engage in slow, deliberate, light stretching, taking care to pay attention to the physical sensations in your muscles and joints as you move. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.4">The key here is to be very gentle because this exercise is supposed to be relaxing, so you don’t want to overdo it, especially if this isn’t a regular activity </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">for you.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">One final general “exercise” is simply to take a break from what you’re doing for a few minutes and allow your mind to wander for a little while! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">You’d be surprised how just letting go for a minute or two can paradoxically help you re-focus on the task at hand afterward. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.3">In addition, it allows your mind time to process things at a lower level, which is often exactly what you need to break through a tricky problem </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">or challenge.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">Of course, attention to detail and sweating the small stuff is the goal, but at some point, you’re going to have to simply know stuff to get your work done. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.2">But not one of us knows everything, myself</span><a id="_idIndexMarker952"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1"> included! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.2">What we </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">do</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1"> all have to know though is how to find the information we need and gain the knowledge we require as we go, and one of the primary ways in this day and age to do so is through online search engines. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.2">Let’s talk about that a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">bit now.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-263"><a id="_idTextAnchor263"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">Exercising your Google-Fu</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">As I’ve mentioned</span><a id="_idIndexMarker953"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1"> a few times before, as a web developer, you won’t be expected to know everything off the top of your head. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">There is simply too much to know – too much to keep in your meat-computer all at once. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.3">Instead, what </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">will</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1"> be expected of you is that you keep some general concepts in your head, particularly concerning the stuff you’re using at the moment in your head – if you’re currently writing a lot of JavaScript, then it’s reasonable (and, fortunately, natural) to start to remember things such as the methods available on arrays since you’ll be using </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">those frequently</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">But what will </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">always</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1"> be expected is that you can search for information when you need it and synthesize it into actions as you go. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.2">The term “Google-Fu” is often used to describe this ability, playfully combining “Google” and “Kung-fu” to describe a person’s skill and efficient use of Google (or any search engine). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.3">It involves the ability to quickly find </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">precise information.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">You may think that just means entering the right keywords, and that’s a big part of it, but it also involves understanding how search engines work and using advanced search techniques such as Boolean operators, filters, and specific search commands to create better search terms that more quickly and accurately get you the information </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">you need.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">Let’s look at a few of these key points that play into developing your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">Google-Fu skills:</span></span></p>
<ul>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">Search engines are</span><a id="_idIndexMarker958"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1"> now also integrating AI into their results. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.2">For example, at the time of writing, Google will usually show you a generative AI experiment section above the usual search results. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.3">These results tend to be very good for certain types of searches. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.4">For example, </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.1">how do I sort an array in Javascript</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.1"> is likely to get you a good result, as seen in </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1">Figure 10</span></em></span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">.1</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">), primarily because generative AI tends to work better when you ask a question naturally as opposed to just searching for a collection of keywords as you might tend to do with a straight </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1">web search:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.1">Having been around for several years and built up content over that period, it is now something of a database with all sorts of developer knowledge contained in it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.2">That’s why search engine results for software development-related searches will so often land there. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.3">But it’s still a very active site on its own which you can use independent of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.1">search engines.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.1">Once you go to SO and create a free account, you’ll be able to ask questions in various categories and with various tags to identify what it’s about, and then sit back and wait for people to answer! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.2">And here’s the best part: as you answer questions, you gain reputation points, which incentivizes people to answer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.3">While not particularly common in my experience, being able to say you have a high reputation score on SO can sometimes look pretty good to people during an interview, so it’s worth answering questions when you feel </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.1">ready to.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.1">In addition, both questions and answers get voted on by the SO community. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.2">With more upvotes to questions comes more visibility, which usually means more answers, and upvotes help answers earn more reputation for their writers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.3">All of this leads to a community-based moderation such that “good” questions and answers get raised, in a sense, while “bad” questions and answers get pushed down (less reputation, possibly less occurrence</span><a id="_idIndexMarker965"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.1"> in </span><a id="_idIndexMarker966"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.1">search results, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.1">so on).</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.1">First, before you</span><a id="_idIndexMarker971"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.1"> even ask a question, be sure to take some time trying to find a suitable answer on SO. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.2">As I mentioned earlier, you’ll rarely be the first person to encounter a given situation, so there’s a fair chance what you intend to ask has already been answered. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.3">It’s not at all uncommon on SO to post a question and immediately get a (not especially polite) answer that it’s a duplicate of an existing question. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.4">Try to avoid that if you can by finding that answer on your own, whether through Google or directly searching within </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.1">SO itself.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.1">Next, when asking a question, it should come as no surprise that being friendly is an effective way to start. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.2">Simple things like “Hi! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.3">I’m having a problem with </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.1">X</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.1"> and would appreciate any help I can get on it” helps you come across as someone people want to assist. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.2">Don’t come across like you’re entitled to answers – that’s it in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.1">a nutshell.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.1">As you get answers, even if some aren’t helpful or even downright rude (which, fair warning, some will be), continue to be professional, patient, and polite. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.2">Developers can sometimes be a blunt group of people, but that doesn’t mean they are being mean or aren’t legitimately trying to help. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.3">Give them the benefit of the doubt, expand on the question if needed, and provide additional information, always while being polite. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.4">Of course, if you do run into people who just seem to want to make you have a difficult day, ignoring them is perfectly acceptable and probably the best thing to do in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.1">such situations.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.1">After that, it’s important to show that you’ve done some work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.2">Questions like “I’m trying to get my app to run in Tomcat but it’s not working, it’s giving me some error, please help,” is a sure way to get ignored, or downvoted. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.3">Instead, spell out what you’ve tried so far to resolve the issue, and provide as much detail </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.1">as possible:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.1">What error specifically did </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.1">you get?</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.1">What were you specifically trying to do when </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.1">it happened?</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.1">Where did you research to try and find an </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.1">answer yourself?</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.1">Failing that, what did you try on your own before deciding you </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.1">needed help?</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.1">People on SO really tend not to like it when someone asking a question seemingly hasn’t tried to resolve it themselves, so you want to make it clear that you have, and that means </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.1">providing details.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.1">Do your best to isolate the problem too. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.2">In other words, try to remove as much from the problem as possible so it’s focused as best you can. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.3">If you have a piece of code that isn’t working, try to remove any code that you are certain works and that isn’t necessary to understand the problem code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.4">Developers rarely need to see one hundred different functions to figure out why one isn’t working right, so don’t spam the question with a lot of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.1">extraneous content.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.1">Also, be sure to spell out the precise result you’re looking for and write a good, clear, but as concise as possible title for the post. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.2">The title should clearly describe the problem in as few words as possible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.3">For example, “Help, JavaScript problem” is too generic to be of value, but “JavaScript array sort not resulting in properly sorted array” is much more specific and isn’t overly long either. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.4">Also, ensure you’re only really asking one question per post; otherwise, things can get very confusing and not very helpful in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.1">a hurry.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.1">As the answers start to roll in, you may need to engage a bit to get what you need. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.2">That might mean clarifying your question, or providing more information as requested. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.3">Remember that SO is a dialogue between you and the people willing to help. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.4">Sometimes, you’ll get precisely what you need immediately; other, times you may need to go through some back-and-forth to get there. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.5">And, of course, fight the urge to get frustrated if it takes a</span><a id="_idIndexMarker972"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.1"> while or you ultimately don’t get an answer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.2">Keep in mind that these are people who are giving their time and energy to try and help you, so even if they give you wrong answers, don’t hold it against them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.3">It’s all but certain they didn’t do it on purpose! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.4">Just roll with it and remember that even a wrong answer can sometimes be helpful, might even get you to see something you didn’t before, and find the answer as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.1">a result.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.1">Lastly, when you do find good answers, be sure to upvote them, and be sure to accept correct answers that help you solve your problem. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.2">This is important to keep the reputation system working and keep providing incentives for people to help each other. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.3">Some people are on SO a lot specifically to answer as many questions as possible to get their reputation as high as possible, while others will just be occasional visitors who will help when they can. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.4">Either way, you want to ensure they get credit for helping you so that they’ll be more inclined to help others – and maybe that’s you again!  </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.5">– next </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.1">time too.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.1">One final thing I’ll mention is that just the simple act of writing a good question on SO can help you discover the answer on your own! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.2">I can’t tell you how many times I’ve spent 20 minutes writing up a question, and halfway in I realized what the answer was. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.3">This happens in the same way that rubber duck debugging does. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.4">Rubber duck debugging is when a developer – sometimes very literally – talks through a problem to a rubber duck. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.5">Yes, a real, physical, rubber duck like kids often play with in the bathtub! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.6">It sounds weird and silly, I know, but the simple act of explaining a problem, talking through what you’ve tried to resolve it, and detailing what you think could be the problem is all it takes to unblock your brain and have that “eureka!” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.7">moment you need. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.8">So, whether you get yourself an actua</span><a id="_idIndexMarker973"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.292.1">l rubber duck, or just type a question on SO that you ultimately don’t even post, sometimes that alone will get the job done, weird as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.293.1">it seems!</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.294.1">Giving good answers</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.295.1">Of course, asking</span><a id="_idIndexMarker974"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.1"> good questions is only half the equation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.2">Especially early in your web developer journey, it’s the position you’ll find yourself in most of the time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.3">But eventually, you may find your confidence and experience at a point where you’ll want to answer some questions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.4">You might even find that you can answer some early on because you just so happen to have encountered something someone else is not struggling with. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.5">Either way, providing good answers is important to making </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.297.1">SO work.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.1">Ensure your answers are direct. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.2">You’ll often find answers that are generally good but go off on tangents about why this technology or design choice isn’t ideal – this isn’t always bad, and sometimes it’s very necessary to answer a given question, but sometimes, it’s just someone stating an unsolicited opinion and it has no real benefit to the person asking the question. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.3">So, stay focused on providing a specific answer to the specific question asked as much </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.1">as possible.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.1">When answering questions, always remember that not all developers are on the same level. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.2">Some are just starting, some have much more experience than you, and all the stops on the spectrum in between those two. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.3">Try to avoid assumptions, and always remain polite. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.4">Be respectful and professional at all times no matter what happens. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.5">To be sure, you may sometimes get a reply like “No, that’s wrong, I tried that, do better next time” or something rude like that. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.6">Just ignore it rather than start a flame war with someone (even though they kind of would deserve it with a reply like that!). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.7">It’s just not worth the time and energy </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.1">you’ll waste.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.302.1">When answering, you want to be as clear and concise as possible, and what can help there is giving simple examples. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.302.2">Sometimes, a simple example is worth a thousand words. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.302.3">You’ll also want to explain your solution in as simplistic terms as possible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.302.4">Again, don’t make assumptions about what others know – explain every little thing as if you’re sure they don’t </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.1">know it.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.304.1">Be sure to cite references where appropriate. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.304.2">This is a fantastic way to help others learn by showing information sources they may not have been aware of and allowing them to learn beyond the horizon of the question they asked without coming across as pushy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.304.3">They may get the answer you gave, but then go read the documentation you used to arrive at it and learn other things they didn’t think of in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.305.1">the process.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.1">Finally, while I’ve said this several times, I think it’s important enough to say once more: whether asking or answering questions, no matter how your interactions go, always take the high road! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.2">SO sometimes gets a reputation for toxic interactions, but if you keep things positive, I think you’ll find those are very rare (and they will then be easy to ignore when and if they</span><a id="_idIndexMarker975"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.1"> do happen). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.2">Remember that SO is a village, a bunch of people interacting and working together. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.3">As with any village, there are probably some not-so-pleasant people floating around that you might run into. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.4">Do everything you can to never be one of them yourself and I believe you’ll find SO a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.308.1">valuable resource.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.1">Of course, SO is a social environment where you interact with other people. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.2">That isn’t the only choice, though. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.3">Another way you’ll often get answers is just by reading documentation on various sites. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.4">As a web developer specifically, though, there’s probably one site that you’ll find yourself on more times than not, and that’s the MDN. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.5">So, let’s talk about </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.310.1">that now.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.312.1">MDN or MDN </span><a id="_idIndexMarker976"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.313.1">Web Docs, as it’s sometimes called, is one of the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker977"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.1">most comprehensive resources for web developers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.2">The site offers reference documentation, tutorials, examples, and guides for all things web technologies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.3">It’s a very respected source of information. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.4">You can find MDN here: </span><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.315.1">https://developer.mozilla.org</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.2">In </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.1">Figure 10</span></em></span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.318.1">.3</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.319.1">, I’ve selected a JavaScript object to show some reference material </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.1">for it:</span></span></p>

<ul>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.327.1">Documentation</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.1">: MDN is well-known for its thorough documentation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.2">It covers the main web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but also covers other topics in web development such as important protocols, web extensions for browsers, and accessibility. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.3">The content is incredibly detailed and well-organized, and it includes tons of examples. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.4">All of this makes it a valuable resource for both beginners and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.1">experienced developers.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.330.1">Community-driven</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.331.1">: While not a social site like SO, MDN is its community-driven nature nonetheless. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.331.2">Both professional developers and volunteers from around the world contribute to its content regularly but in a more formal way than a site such as SO. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.331.3">This helps to ensure that the information presented is both accurate and up to date at all times and takes the latest web standards and best practices into account. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.331.4">The MDN maintainers work closely with web standards bodies such as</span><a id="_idIndexMarker980"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.1"> the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.333.1">World Wide Web Consortium</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.334.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.335.1">W3C</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.336.1">) and the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.337.1">Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.1">WHATWG</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.1">) to </span><a id="_idIndexMarker981"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.1">help ensure that the documentation reflects the most current </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.1">web standards.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.1">Tutorials and guides</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.1">: While MDN provides a wealth of reference material, it goes beyond that by providing tutorials and learning paths for those new to web development or</span><a id="_idIndexMarker982"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.1"> looking to expand their skills. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.2">These</span><a id="_idIndexMarker983"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.346.1"> resources are designed to be practical and easy to follow and to give you the knowledge and skills you need, so you can consider it not just a reference site but also a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.347.1">learning site.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.1">Accessibility and internationalization</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.349.1">: MDN emphasizes web accessibility information, helping to ensure that the web content you build using the information it provides is accessible to people with disabilities (we discussed accessibility in </span><a href="B18315_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor129"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.1">Chapter 5</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.351.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.351.2">It also offers content in multiple languages, reflecting its global </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.352.1">user base.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.353.1">Compatibility and browser support</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.1">: MDN includes detailed information on browser compatibility for different web features, which is crucial for developers aiming to create cross-platform web applications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.2">With it, you can ensure that a given feature will work across a range of browsers as you expect it to, maximizing the audience for the sites </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.1">you build.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.1">Dev tools</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.357.1">: MDN also provides guides and references for browser dev tools. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.357.2">This helps developers debug and optimize their code by exploring ways the dev tools can </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.1">be used.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.1">Open-source and free</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.360.1">: MDN is an open-source resource, and its content is available for free. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.360.2">This is thanks to Mozilla’s mission to keep the internet open and accessible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.360.3">Their most well-known product, the Firefox browser, is a primary example of this goal, but MDN isn’t </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.1">far behind!</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.1">Unlike SO, MDN isn’t a social site. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.2">There isn’t the sort of interaction with other developers there that you’ll experience with SO. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.3">But it’s one of the absolute best sites you can bookmark to use as a source of reference material available. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.4">It is highly accurate, always up to date, and just generally reliable in every way </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.1">that matters.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.364.1">Another consideration when we talk about things you can do as a developer to be successful is the judicious use of various tools that help you write better code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.364.2">IDEs are of course one of those, but</span><a id="_idIndexMarker984"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.365.1"> there are also standalone tools (which</span><a id="_idIndexMarker985"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.366.1"> can also usually be integrated into your IDE as well) that can examine your code and help you make it better. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.366.2">We’ll talk about some of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.367.1">those next.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.369.1">When you write </span><a id="_idIndexMarker986"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.370.1">code, it’s you against the machine. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.370.2">You write your code, you run it, you see what it does or doesn’t do right, and you debug it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.370.3">You do this over and over again until it’s working as expected. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.370.4">You mold that clay, in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.371.1">digital form!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.372.1">But there’s almost always something you could do to make it better. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.372.2">Unless the code is small and trivial, that tends to be the case. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.372.3">Maybe there are still bugs in it that you just haven’t discovered. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.372.4">Maybe there are things you could do to make it perform better. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.372.5">Maybe there are security issues that will only be problems in certain very specific situations (which, unfortunately, threat actors are very good at finding). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.372.6">Or, maybe it’s simply not formatted as consistently as it </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.373.1">could be.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.1">In all these cases, you don’t have to go it alone! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.2">Some tools can help you write better code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.3">They fall into three broad</span><a id="_idIndexMarker987"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.375.1"> categories: </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.1">static code analysis</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.377.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.378.1">SCA</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.1">) tools, linters, and stylers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.2">There is significant overlap between these, and often, you’ll hear developers just talking about “static analysis tools” in a general way, but there are enough differences to create these three </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.380.1">broad categories.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.1">Regardless of the category, though, they involve tools that analyze your code, report issues, and give you recommendations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.2">Being a professional developer will almost certainly involve using these tools. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.3">And even if you wind up working somewhere that doesn’t make use of these tools generally, you, as a good developer, should do so on your own regardless </span><a id="_idIndexMarker988"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.382.1">because they really can bring a lot of benefits to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.1">your work.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.1">Let’s start by talking about SCA tools, which are probably the broadest and most fungible of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.1">the categories.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-268"><a id="_idTextAnchor268"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.1">SCA tools</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.1">The purpose of SCA</span><a id="_idIndexMarker989"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.1"> tools is to analyze source code without </span><a id="_idIndexMarker990"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.1">actually executing it, alerting you to problems you may not see on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.390.1">your own.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.1">These types of tools typically run from a command line, where you simply tell it where your source code is and it will go off and do its thing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.2">Some of them have GUIs to make using them a little easier. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.3">Most can be integrated into your IDE and executed </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.1">from there.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.393.1">In addition, it’s not at all uncommon to find these tools integrated into a CI/CD pipeline, and sometimes in drastic ways. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.393.2">For example, it’s often the case that the build will fail, alerting the entire development team if any SCA failure occurs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.393.3">This helps to ensure that the code is in good shape before it’s pushed out and deployed for people to see, whether to a development environment or even </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.1">to production.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.395.1">Popular examples</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.1">While far from an</span><a id="_idIndexMarker991"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.1"> exhaustive list, which will be true of all of these categories where I give examples, some of the more widely-known SCA tools are </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.398.1">as follows:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.1">SonarQub</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.1">: A widely used tool that looks for all sorts of problems with code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.2">It can point out, for example, places where your code may fail given specific inputs, as well as places where your code doesn’t properly encode output and therefore can result in a security exploit. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.3">It supports the notion of quality gates, which are rules that you can set that determine whether a review passes or fails. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.4">Since it can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines, the build can fail based on these gates if configured to do so. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.5">While SonarQube is generally seen as a very good tool, it can be a bit more complex to set up </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.401.1">and use.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.402.1">Veracode</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.403.1">: Veracode is similar to SonarQube but is focused almost exclusively on security issues. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.403.2">It is cloud-based, which tends to make it easier to use that SonarQube. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.403.3">It is often as easy as uploading your source code and clicking a button. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.403.4">You’ll get back a report that details its findings, complete with links directly to the source code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.403.5">It can not only detect problems in your code but can also point out dependencies you may be using that themselves have known exploits. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.403.6">Veracode also offers a dynamic analysis option, which means it can scan your code at runtime, which allows it to detect flaws that can’t be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.1">detected statically.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.1">Coverity</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.406.1">: This tool is known for its advanced static analysis capabilities, particularly in detecting security vulnerabilities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.406.2">It claims to test every line of code and potential execution path, and then state the root cause of each defect clearly, making it easy to fix problems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.406.3">Some of the types of problems it can detect include resource leaks (when your code doesn’t properly clean up after itself and wastes things like memory), use of uninitialized data (a very common flaw that often leads to security vulnerabilities), and control flow issues (when the logic of your code can lead to code being executed that you don’t </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.407.1">intend to).</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.408.1">While some offer </span><a id="_idIndexMarker992"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.409.1">more robust capabilities, all of these can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines, and also IDEs, though the capabilities provided in each case can differ significantly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.409.2">For example, while Veracode can be integrated into your IDE and report problems immediately, the capabilities are a bit limited since the cloud hosting model means the full capabilities of Veracode can’t run on your machine. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.409.3">This is just something to keep in mind when using </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.410.1">these tools.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.411.1">In addition, and again with some variety in their level of support, all of these tools support multiple programming languages and technology stacks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.411.2">Other tools target specific languages (FindBugs, for example, is a Java-only SCA), so it’s important to research each tool to determine if it will meet your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.412.1">technology needs.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.413.1">The bottom line is that using these tools will help you detect problems early and in most cases before your</span><a id="_idIndexMarker993"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.414.1"> code is deployed or run. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.414.2">This means your output will be more solid and robust, and that’s the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.415.1">ultimate goal.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-269"><a id="_idTextAnchor269"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.416.1">Linters</span></h2>
<p><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.1">Linters</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.1"> perform </span><a id="_idIndexMarker994"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.419.1">much the same function as SCA tools but at a somewhat different level. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.419.2">While </span><a id="_idIndexMarker995"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.420.1">the analysis done by SCA tools can be very in-depth, linters tend to not go as deeply into the code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.420.2">SCA tools will normally go deeper by, in a sense, executing your code – not literally, but in the sense that they can analyze the code and determine how data will flow through it, thereby finding deep flaws in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.421.1">the code.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.1">Linters, by contrast, look for specific patterns, known constructs that tend to lead to errors, as well as code that doesn’t adhere to established standards. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.2">This means that linters tend to be much faster than SCA tools, which means using them regularly is much less intrusive. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.3">SCA tools, by contrast, can often take significant time to perform their analysis. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.4">Linters can find security issues just like SCA tools can, but they do so at a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.423.1">higher level.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.424.1">In essence, think of linters as tools that look at your code more or less as text, looking for specific patterns that may indicate an issue, whereas SCA tools are more like you as a programmer when debugging in that you’re walking through the code in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.425.1">your head.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.426.1">Linters help maintain a consistent coding style, making the code more readable and maintainable, based on rules you set. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.426.2">Again, this is just about pattern recognition: a linter can tell you if you forget to put a semicolon on the end of a line if you’ve configured its rules to tell you that, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.427.1">for example.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.428.1">Linters are almost always language-specific as a result since the variations across different programming languages tend to lead to different patterns to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.429.1">look for.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.430.1">Popular examples</span></h3>

<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.434.1">ESLint</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.435.1">: This is a linter for JavaScript. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.435.2">It is highly configurable in that you can determine the rules it should use at a very fine-grained level. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.435.3">It supports the latest Javascript standards, which helps to ensure your code is written in a modern, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.436.1">robust way.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.1">Pylint</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.438.1">: This linter is a popular one for Pythion. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.438.2">It is flexible, similar to how ESLint is, and can find all sorts of bugs and code smells (bits of code that developers tend to view as, while not being outright bugs, things that typically shouldn’t be done a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.439.1">given way).</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.440.1">CheckStyle</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.1">: A popular linter for Java. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.2">It primarily focuses on code style and formatting, not so much on error detection, though there is some of that in it as well. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.3">It is highly </span><a id="_idIndexMarker997"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.442.1">configurable, though that configuration can be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.443.1">somewhat complex.</span></span></li>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-270"><a id="_idTextAnchor270"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.444.1">Stylers</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.445.1">While linters will point out problems in code, they don’t touch the code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.445.2">This is true of SCA tools as well. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.445.3">The</span><a id="_idIndexMarker998"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.446.1"> other class of tools is stylers (sometimes called formatters), and these</span><a id="_idIndexMarker999"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.447.1"> very much do touch your code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.447.2">They can automatically format source code to a particular style guide, ensuring consistency across even an entire codebase. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.447.3">Unlike linters, they don’t just flag issues but also reformat the code to meet the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.448.1">specified guidelines.</span></span></p>
<p><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.449.1">Stylers</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.450.1"> tend to be straightforward to use and often configurable to fit team-specific styles and rules. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.450.2">However, they can also be dangerous. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.450.3">I don’t mean dangerous in terms of anything being broken – I don’t recall ever seeing a styler break code – but dangerous in the sense that it can alter the structure of code very quickly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.450.4">If you didn’t set the rules right, then you’ll probably wind up having a cleanup task on your hands (which, hopefully, just means altering the rules and re-running the styler, but that may not </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.451.1">always work).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.1">Stylers are all about maintaining consistent, appropriate formatting and styling of code, but I have to caution you against relying on them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.2">Many developers believe they can write code any way they want because they know they will run a styler on it when they’re done, at which point it will have the correct styling. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.3">In my experience, this is a poor way </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.453.1">to work.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.454.1">My wife, a trained chef, always impresses upon me when we prepare a meal together that a true professional chef will clean up as they go. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.454.2">They don’t simply make a big mess as they’re cooking and then clean it up at the end. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.454.3">They are constantly cleaning up their station because that leads to fewer mistakes (you don’t want to cut yourself because you slipped on a messy station) and more consistent results. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.454.4">I’ve come to view coding in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.455.1">same way.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.456.1">I’ve seen developers write code where sometimes, they indent with two spaces and sometimes with four. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.456.2">Sometimes, they put braces on the end of a line and sometimes alone on the next line. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.456.3">To be sure, the code doesn’t care – it’ll work just fine either way. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.456.4">But this sloppiness leads to more mistakes just because inconsistency tends to make code harder to follow, which is why we care about it </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.457.1">at all.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.458.1">I believe that like a professional chef, a professional developer cleans up as they go. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.458.2">For us, that means writing well-formatted and most importantly consistently-formatted code </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.459.1">as you go</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.2">Yes, you should use a styler at the end to catch any mistakes you’ve made because, after all, none of us are perfect. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.3">But to put it simply: you want that styler to do as little as possible! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.4">There should be little for it to change in your code because you’ve already styled it properly yourself in effect. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.5">Make this a habit, something you do without thinking, and</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1000"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.461.1"> it won’t</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1001"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.462.1"> get in the way of your work at all. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.462.2">I would argue it’ll make you more efficient since your brain won’t have to deal with the inconsistency of your work as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.463.1">you debug.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.464.1">Popular examples</span></h3>

<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.467.1">Prettier</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.468.1">: One </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1002"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.469.1">of the most widely adopted stylers, it supports many languages and integrates with most IDEs and even plain old text editors. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.469.2">It normally takes nothing more than pressing a key combination and your code will be reformatted instantly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.469.3">While Prettier is configurable, it’s a bit limited in this area purposely. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.469.4">Instead, Prettier is what we call an </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.470.1">opinionated</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.471.1"> tool. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.471.2">By default, it uses a set of sensible and common settings, the goal being that you shouldn’t have to configure it </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.472.1">at all.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.473.1">Black</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.474.1">: A well-known Python styler, it is known for its uncompromising approach to formatting Python code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.474.2">It is even more opinionated than Prettier and therefore has fewer configuration options. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.474.3">So long as you like the style it provides, it’s excellent and will work for you immediately with almost no </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.475.1">setup cost.</span></span></li>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.487.1">The sorts of tools we’ve</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1004"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.488.1"> been discussing all have the explicit purpose of making your code better in some way, be that more error-free, formatted well, or anything else. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.488.2">And these tools are fantastic and definitely should be used. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.488.3">But there’s one that you should be using at all times, and that’s you – you and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.489.1">your brain!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.490.1">The best developers won’t rely on the tools discussed; instead, they will use them as backup because all along they will have been writing clean, solid code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.490.2">No one is perfect, of course, which is why we need these tools to be watching over our backs, so to speak, to catch what we miss. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.490.3">But if we’re doing things right, then there should be very little for these tools to catch anyway because we will, out of habit, have been writing our code with proper formatting all along, and with solid development principles </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.491.1">all along.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.492.1">But one other thing you’ll want to keep in mind is commenting code because while these tools can point out places you haven’t commented well, to some extent, this is by and large an area you have to do yourself because generally speaking, the machine doesn’t know what you’re thinking (some of the new AI-based tooling is starting to change this, but we’re still in early days of that, so it’s better to develop good </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.493.1">habits yourself).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.494.1">Documenting our code is very important, and that’s where writing comments in that code comes into play. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.494.2">In your career, you will undoubtedly meet developers who will tell you that commenting code isn’t necessary if it is “self-documenting.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.494.3">What do they mean </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.495.1">by this?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.496.1">What they mean is that code should be written clearly and “obviously,” and part of that is good naming. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.496.2">For example, take a look at </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.497.1">this code:</span></span></p>
<pre class="source-code"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.498.1">
const ac = getAc("zammetti");</span></pre> <p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.499.1">What does that do? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.499.2">Well, you can tell that the </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.500.1">getAc()</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.501.1"> function will return… something. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.501.2">And it’ll be stored in the </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.502.1">ac</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.503.1"> variable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.503.2">That’s all obvious. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.503.3">But what does </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.504.1">getAc()</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.505.1"> return? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.505.2">And what is the </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.506.1">ac</span></strong> <span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.507.1">variable hold?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.1">You could rewrite this code in a much </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.509.1">clearer way:</span></span></p>
<pre class="source-code"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.510.1">
const checkingAccount = getCheckingAccountFromLastName("Zammetti");</span></pre> <p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.511.1">Now, it’s obvious what’s going on because the name of the variable and the name of the function spell out – by their very names – what they’re for. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.511.2">There’s no guesswork. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.511.3">That’s what is meant by</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1005"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.512.1"> self-documenting code: naming things in such a way that they convey information about </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.513.1">their purpose.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.514.1">However, even when you do that, there is information that can’t be properly conveyed by just good variable and function names. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.514.2">That’s where comments in the code come into play. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.514.3">As I mentioned, there is a fair bit of debate about commenting in code, with some developers preferring as little as possible, while others would argue that there should be more comments than actual code in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.515.1">your code!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.516.1">In my experience, the best answer falls somewhere in the middle. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.516.2">One key tenet to keep in mind is that comments should explain the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.517.1">why</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.518.1"> of the code, not the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.519.1">what</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.520.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.520.2">In other words, you shouldn’t comment on every line of code explaining what it does because – assuming it’s written clearly, as described previously – the line tells you what it does anyway. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.520.3">The code itself is the what, so don’t </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.521.1">do this:</span></span></p>
<pre class="source-code"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.522.1">
// Get the checking account.
</span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.522.2">const checkingAccount = getCheckingAccuntFromLastName("Zammetti");

// Create a transaction.

</span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.522.7">account.saveToDatabase();</span></pre> <p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.1">Instead, I would suggest that a better way to comment this code might be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.524.1">as follows:</span></span></p>
<pre class="source-code"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.525.1">

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.531.1">But even that comment might not truly be necessary (except for the aforementioned signpost) because it doesn’t explain </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.532.1">why</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.533.1"> the code exists. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.533.2">Why are we adding a transaction and updating the account? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.533.3">The why of things is where comments come to earn their keep. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.533.4">Explaining how parts of the code work together is ripe for commenting. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.533.5">Describing any gotchas that might be in the code – that’s </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.534.1">worth commenting.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.535.1">For example, you might write a comment above that </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.536.1">getCheckingAccountFromLastName()</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.537.1"> function - something along the lines </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.538.1">of this:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.543.1">One of the reasons some developers say that commenting is to be avoided is because “the comments lie.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.543.2">What they mean is that if you modify that function such that it will return </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.544.1">null</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.545.1"> rather than an empty </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.546.1">Account</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.547.1"> object when </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.1">inLastName</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.549.1"> is </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.550.1">null</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.551.1"> – a change that might be necessary for some reason later – if you don’t update the comment along with the code then the comment will, in fact, “lie.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.551.2">It tells you to expect an empty </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.1">Account</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.553.1"> object when </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.554.1">inLastName</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.555.1"> is </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.556.1">null</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.557.1">, but that’s no longer </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.558.1">the case.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.559.1">While some say you can avoid this by not writing comments, which is undoubtedly true, it’s not a good answer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.559.2">Instead, the right way to solve that problem is to treat comments as being just as important as the code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.559.3">When you change the code, get in the habit of changing the comment too. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.559.4">Some developers will update the comment first to, in a sense, give themselves a guideline for the work they’re about to do. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.559.5">Either way, don’t treat comments as an afterthought and you’ll tend not to wind up with “</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.560.1">lying” comments.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.561.1">At the end of the day, get into the habit of commenting more, not less, but also keep an eye out for superfluous comments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.561.2">If you find yourself commenting more about what is happening rather than why, then you’re probably taking it too far, and it also may indicate that you haven’t written your code in a self-documenting way (because why would you need so many comments if the code didn’t make things </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.562.1">obvious already?)</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.563.1">But I can tell you, as someone who has had to deal with large volumes of code that had little to no comments, I will take an overly-verbosely-commented code base over one with sparse comments any day of the week, no matter how self-documenting it’s written. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.563.2">Even bad comments are like bad pizza: it’s still pretty good! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.563.3">Ultimately, it’s all about balance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.563.4">Too much commenting that isn’t useful can just get in the way, but not enough is just as bad. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.563.5">Shoot for the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.564.1">middle ground.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.565.1">Besides</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1008"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.566.1"> commenting and having good habits, another aspect of using your brain is the fact that in this line of work, a lot of the time, you’ll need that brain to work on more than one thing at a time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.566.2">Let’s get into what </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.567.1">that means.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-272"><a id="_idTextAnchor272"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.568.1">Multitasking (like a CPU on the wind!)</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.569.1">The CPU in your</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1009"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.570.1"> computer is an amazing technical achievement. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.570.2">A gentleman by the name of Ben Driscoll said it best in a tweet one time: “If you ever code something that feels like a hack, but it works, just remember that a CPU is literally a rock that we tricked </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.571.1">into thinking.”</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.572.1">What’s perhaps most amazing about it is how it can (seemingly) do many things at once. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.572.2">When you’re using Windows, OSX, or a Linux-based desktop, you can have many windows opened at once with many different programs running at the same time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.572.3">While the CPU isn’t the only thing responsible for that, it’s certainly a key part and it always blows my mind when I stop and think </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.573.1">about it.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.574.1">To a certain extent, as a web developer, you will have to act like a CPU, handling multiple tasks at once. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.574.2">Of course, a human being just can’t do quite as much at a single time as a CPU can, but the CPU is pulling a trick on you. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.574.3">You see, it’s not doing multiple things at once either (I admit I’m simplifying this a bit here to make the comparison work, but it’s true enough at a high level to work). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.574.4">Instead, what a CPU is doing is switching between many tasks very fast – so fast that the illusion of it all happening at the same time is maintained on a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.575.1">human timescale.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.576.1">Web developers often have to work in the same general way. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.576.2">That’s because the outcome of one task will often feed another, but the process becomes cyclic, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.577.1">therefore iterative.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.578.1">For example, as you write the HTML and CSS for a website, you may realize that the images you prepared earlier won’t quite work as planned. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.578.2">As a result, you have to go back and redo them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.578.3">You can choose to wait until you’re done with the coding and then redo the images – and sometimes that’s totally viable and probably the best way to go – but other times, redoing the images may then feed back into the HTML and CSS in some way that causes you to</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1010"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.579.1"> have to tweak that now (maybe you decide that you need to put shadows on the images, which means you may have to go back and remove the CSS that also puts shadows </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.580.1">on them).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.581.1">Or it could be that as you write the code, you want to deploy it for your customers to see as you work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.581.2">So, you have to alternate between coding </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.582.1">and deploying.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.583.1">What should be clear is that you have to do as a CPU does and switch between tasks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.583.2">Hopefully, you don’t have to do it as fast as a CPU and not as regularly! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.583.3">Ideally, it’s usually better to complete one task before moving on to another as a human being. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.583.4">That’s not always </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.584.1">possible, though.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.585.1">If you suspect this can get stressful, then you are right, it definitely can be. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.585.2">So, how can you deal </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.586.1">with that?</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-273"><a id="_idTextAnchor273"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.587.1">Keeping notes</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.588.1">One thing that I find </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1011"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.589.1">helps me is to keep judicious notes about the tasks I’m working on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.589.2">I’ll write down where I am on a given task every so often and record the steps I’ve already taken. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.589.3">I’ll also write down what I plan to do next, and what I think is required </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.590.1">going forward.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.591.1">The benefit of this is that when I have to switch to another task for a while and then come back to the first one, I’m not trying to recreate my entire mental model of the task from scratch. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.591.2">Instead, I have comments and outlines and maybe even simple diagrams to help me pick up where I left </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.592.1">off faster.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.593.1">I also tend to like to keep these notes somewhere I can access them all the time – my current choice is Google Keep, but you can use anything that lets you get to your information anywhere. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.593.2">I find this beneficial because sometimes you’ll have random, intrusive thoughts about a task during downtime, or during other tasks sometimes, and it’s helpful to be able to jot down notes about the thought in the same place all the other information about the task already is. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.593.3">That way, when I go back to the task, the thought is right there waiting for me (even if it immediately left my head after I wrote it down, which happens </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.594.1">a lot!)</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.595.1">Keeping notes is good, but ultimately, you still have to switch between tasks and manage those tasks, and that can be stressful, notes or not. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.595.2">One part of that stress can come from poor time management. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.595.3">So, how do you manage the time allotted to each task in a way that </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1012"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.596.1">this at least has a chance to reduce stress? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.596.2">One approach that works pretty well </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.597.1">is time-boxing.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.605.1">Maybe you have to write some code, so you time-box that to an hour. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.605.2">Then, you go off and code for an hour. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.605.3">But if 20 minutes in you realize you have to modify your images, instead of switching tasks immediately, you continue coding until you either reach your hour time box limit or you finish earlier than that (which is always okay). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.605.4">Only then do you move on to the images, and again you would time-box that task </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.606.1">as well.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.607.1">There may be cases where you </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.608.1">have</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.609.1"> to break out of a time box – if you simply can’t continue the code unless the images are right, for example – but in most situations, that tends to not be the case. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.609.2">Even tasks you discover as you work can usually wait until your current task is done. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.609.3">Of course, you may consider something you discover as you work to simply be part of the task at hand anyway, in which case your time box should still stand, but you alter the work you’re doing within </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.610.1">it slightly.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.611.1">One of the biggest problems people deal with as they work on a project, whether you effectively time-box tasks or not, is interruptions, usually from other people. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.611.2">As with a real CPU, which</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1016"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.612.1"> can sometimes need to have its current task interrupted for something important, a human CPU faces this issue as well. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.612.2">How can you deal </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.613.1">with that?</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-275"><a id="_idTextAnchor275"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.614.1">Deferring and Do Not Disturb</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.615.1">The trick is to</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1017"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.616.1"> defer any interruptions you</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1018"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.617.1"> can in a way that comes across well to others. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.617.2">It also requires an awareness of the communication channel the interruption comes </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.618.1">in on.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.619.1">What I mean is that someone walking up to your desk and starting a conversation with you has a different immediacy to it than a text message, an instant message, or an email. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.619.2">The hope is that people use an appropriate communication channel, but they don’t always. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.619.3">If someone has a question that doesn’t require an immediate response for example, then an email is usually better than a phone call. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.619.4">If, on the other hand, they have a problem that is keeping them from continuing their work at all (what we usually call a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.620.1">blocker</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.621.1">), then</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1019"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.622.1"> they may have no choice but to come over to your desk and get your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.623.1">immediate attention.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.624.1">What you have to be aware of is that unless the situation is severe, you have the option of deferring! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.624.2">You can simply say “I’m right in the middle of something at the moment, let me get back to you as soon as I free up.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.624.3">Yes, if they perceive their need as being more immediate, then they may not take it quite as well as they otherwise would, but at some point, that becomes a “not my problem” situation for you. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.624.4">After all, you have work to get done, and that’s hard to do if you can’t focus on it because you have to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.625.1">help others.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.626.1">Still, being the person who is recognized as always being helpful and the person who usually has the answers is a nice feeling, but it’s also difficult when factoring in the work you are doing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.626.2">Constant context-switching can be a productivity killer when it’s unplanned. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.626.3">Therefore, when things get to a certain point, putting up a Do Not Disturb sign might </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.627.1">be appropriate.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.628.1">In an office environment, that could be a literal sign! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.628.2">If you have an office, then closing the door might be essentially what it is. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.628.3">Or when dealing with instant messaging systems such as Microsoft Teams, setting your status to Do Not Disturb for a while is a terrific way to get the focus time you need. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.628.4">Like I said earlier, being a go-to person has its benefits, but it </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1020"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.629.1">can’t </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1021"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.630.1">usually be without limits; otherwise, you’ll find your productivity sinking like </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.631.1">a stone.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-276"><a id="_idTextAnchor276"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.632.1">Final thoughts</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.633.1">So, at the end of</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1022"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.634.1"> the day, as with a CPU, you have to expect and deal with context-switching as a web developer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.634.2">It tends to be a pretty natural part of the job. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.634.3">But you have to do what you can to manage it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.634.4">You won’t always be able to, but time-boxing and limiting or outright shutting down communication channels – true emergencies excepted – for a little while are some of the ways you can </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.635.1">achieve that.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.636.1">I like to take it as a bit of a challenge! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.636.2">I get interrupted </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.637.1">a lot</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.638.1"> on the job because I’m one of those go-to people. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.638.2">So, every time it happens, I like to push myself to be as helpful as I can, as quickly as I can, and then see how fast I can get my work back on track. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.638.3">It almost becomes something of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.639.1">a game!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.640.1">The final piece of advice I’d leave you with is that when you do inevitably see your productivity slip, take note of how you help others get their work done. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.640.2">Remember that as part of a team, it’s usually the output of the team as a whole that most matters. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.640.3">Therefore, even if you didn’t get a lot done yourself on a given day, realizing the work you helped others get done shows you how you </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.641.1">were</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.642.1"> productive, just in a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.643.1">different way!</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.653.1">In this chapter, the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.654.1">Code Quality</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.655.1"> and </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.656.1">Soft Skills</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.657.1"> boxes were revealed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.657.2">Regarding soft skills, the next chapter is all about that, but a lot of what was discussed in this chapter can also be to, a degree, labeled soft skills. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.657.3">Certainly, attention to detail and multitasking would</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1024"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.658.1"> fall into that category, so I felt it was appropriate to uncover here, even though the next chapter will dive deeper into </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.659.1">that topic.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-278"><a id="_idTextAnchor278"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.660.1">Summary</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.661.1">In this chapter, we discussed the key skill of paying attention to detail, and we looked at some ways you help you achieve that, to help you stay in the moment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.661.2">We then looked at making effective use of search engines, and helpful websites where you can get information – especially help from other developers </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.662.1">when needed.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.663.1">Then, we looked at some common tools that developers use to ensure code quality including static </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.664.1">analysis tools.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.665.1">Finally, we talked about the idea of multitasking – as CPUs do – and how it’s almost inevitable that you’ll need to be able to shift gears often as a web developer to be effective. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.665.2">We also talked about strategies to help deal with the stress that can naturally come out of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.666.1">that context-switching.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.667.1">Much of this discussion could be said to focus on “soft skills,” but in the next chapter, we’ll look at more traditional terms regarding soft skills – things such as interpersonal relationships, and communication skills. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.667.2">We’ll also talk about development methodologies a little bit, with a specific focus on something called the Agile methodology, since it’s so popular these days, and because to a large degree, it’s an exercise in soft skills to make </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.668.1">it work!</span></span></p>
