- en: Node.js is now well into its second decade and has significantly matured as
    a technology. Today, it is a common technology of choice for building applications
    of all sizes. Many large enterprises use Node.js in production, including the
    likes of Netflix, PayPal, IBM, and even NASA. Due to the widespread usage and
    dependence on Node.js, it was moved under the OpenJS Foundation (formerly the
    Node.js Foundation). The OpenJS Foundation provides a neutral home for JavaScript
    projects, with a strong focus on open governance.

- en: Created in 2009, Node.js wrapped Google Chrome’s JavaScript Engine, V8, to enable
    JavaScript to be run outside the browser. Node.js brought JavaScript to the server
    and was built following an event loop architecture, which enables it to effectively
    handle input/output and concurrent operations. Today, Node.js is a popular technology
    choice for building many types of applications, including HTTP web servers, microservices,
    command-line applications, and more. The key to Node.js’s success is that it enables
    full-stack development in a common language, JavaScript.

- en: The massive ecosystem of Node.js modules has supported Node.js’s success. There
    are now over three million modules available on the **npm** registry, with many
    abstracting lower-level implementation details to higher-level and more easily
    consumable APIs. Building your applications atop **npm** modules can speed up
    the development process while promoting code sharing and reuse.

- en: In recent years, Node.js has seemingly moved away from its small core philosophy,
    providing a more “batteries included” runtime. This evolution includes the adoption
    of more features into the core runtime, such as a built-in test runner, enhancing
    its out-of-the-box developer experience.
