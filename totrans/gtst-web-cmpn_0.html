<p class="mce-root">This book covers information about a web technology called Web Components. Web components are web specifications that provide the user with a component-driven methodology for development. It also provides encapsulation and allows you to use a component-driven methodology without any dependencies. </p>

<p>This book is for developers who have heard about web components, but don't really know where to start. This book is also for intermediate and advanced developers who know what web components are, but are still afraid to use them in production. This book is also for frontend engineers who are simply looking into web components in order to increase their knowledge and skills. </p>
<p>You can also use this book to learn about and get into component-driven methodologies. If you are coming from a React/Angular/Polymer background, this book will give you an insight into how most things can be achieved using vanilla JavaScript without any libraries.</p>
