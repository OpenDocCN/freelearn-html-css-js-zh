- en: It's the start of the term and your physical and Google Classrooms are set up
    and ready for students to enter, and for learning to commence. While students
    simply walk into your physical classroom, sometimes with a school map in hand,
    in your virtual classroom, students must join the classroom from a computer or
    mobile device. As we mentioned in the *Preface*, Google Classroom excels in classrooms
    where computers or mobile devices are readily available or in an online environment.
    Furthermore, students will use the tool more frequently if it can be accessed
    from their own personal devices.

    types of computers, tablets, and smart phones in installing and setting up Google
    Classroom. This chapter provides instructions for several different types of devices.
    We will explore the various methods of inviting students into a Google Classroom
    and managing those students within the class.

- en: Parts of this chapter have been written from a **bring-your-own-device** (**BYOD**)
    context, where students may bring a variety of devices to class and the teacher
    acts as technology support for the class. Some sections may appear repetitive,
    such as installing Google Chrome on Windows and then on macOS. If this is your
    first time using Google Classroom, reference the sections relevant to your devices
    and use the other sections when students require support.

    or mobile device that is connected to the internet. However, not every student
    will access Google Classroom from the same type of device. Therefore, it is important
    that you can help guide your students in setting up Google Classroom.

- en: The best time to invite students to Google Classroom is at the beginning of
    the term. During the first days of class, you will acclimatize your students to
    your classroom expectations and familiarize your students with the course's syllabus.
    Setting up student devices can easily be integrated into this process so that
    students are ready to use Google Classroom at the start of the term, reducing
    the chances of technical difficulties occurring later.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In general, I suggest inviting students to Google Classroom and ensuring all
    their devices are properly set up at the beginning of the term. However, this
    does not mean this has to be done on the first day. In Canadian high schools,
    students often have a couple of weeks to change their courses and thus change
    their timetable. Therefore, it may be more beneficial to wait until the majority
    of these changes are complete before you invite students to Google Classroom.
    It may save you having to make a lot of manual changes as the term progresses.
  prefs: []

- en: When students set up their devices, have them set up Google Classroom on the
    device they will use to access it the most frequently. If your school already
    has a computer lab, mobile laptop, or Chromebook cart, your students will not
    need to set up those devices. For student populations with a high number of personal
    laptops, tablets, and smartphones, devoting class time to setting up their personal
    devices will increase student use of Google Classroom.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Also, another great advantage of students using their personal tablets and
    phones is that the Google Classroom app on iOS and Android provides push notifications
    to those devices. Therefore, encourage your students to use the Google Classroom
    app on their smartphones so that they will always be notified whenever an announcement
    or assignment is posted in Google Classroom:'

    and will complete these tasks quickly. When I teach with Google Classroom, the
    setup process only takes about 15 minutes with high school students. This chapter
    has provided you with the tools for those students that have never used Google
    Classroom, which, as the years go by, will decrease.
