<p class="mce-root">Welcome to the <em>JavaScript Cloud Native Development Cookbook</em>. This cookbook is packed full of recipes to help you along your cloud-native journey. It is intended to be a companion to another of my books, <em>Cloud Native Development Patterns and Best Practices</em>. I have personally found delivering cloud-native solutions to be, by far, the most fun and satisfying development practice. This is because cloud-native is more than just optimizing for the cloud. It is an entirely different way of thinking and reasoning about software systems.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In a nutshell, cloud-native is lean and autonomous. Powered by disposable infrastructure, leveraging fully managed cloud services and embracing disposable architecture, cloud-native empowers everyday, self-sufficient, full-stack teams to rapidly and continuously experiment with innovations, while simultaneously building global-scale systems with much less effort than ever before. Following this serverless-first approach allows teams to move fast, but this rapid pace also opens the opportunity for honest human error to wreak havoc across the system. To guard against this, cloud-native systems are composed of autonomous services, which creates bulkheads between the services to reduce the blast radius during a disruption.</p>
<p class="mce-root">In this cookbook, you will learn how to build autonomous services by eliminating all synchronous inter-service communication. You will turn the database inside out and ultimately turn the cloud into the database by implementing the event sourcing and CQRS patterns with event streaming and materialized views. Your team will build confidence in its ability to deliver because asynchronous inter-service communication and data replication remove the downstream and upstream dependencies that make systems brittle. You will also learn how to continuously deploy, test, observe, optimize, and secure your autonomous services across multiple regions.</p>
<p class="mce-root">To get the most out of this book, be prepared with an open mind to discover why cloud-native is different. Cloud-native forces us to rewire how we reason about systems. It tests all our preconceived notions of software architecture. So, be prepared to have a lot of fun building cloud-native systems.</p>

<p>This book is intended to help create self-sufficient, full-stack, cloud-native development teams. Some cloud experience is helpful, but not required. Basic knowledge of the JavaScript language is assumed. The book serves as a reference for experienced cloud-native developers and as a quick start for entry-level cloud-native developers. Most of all, this book is for anyone who is ready to rewire their engineering brain for cloud-native development.</p>

<p><a href="b2c8b5bd-dfe5-461e-a8fa-3e71c94e633c.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Optimizing Observability</em>, demonstrates how to instill team confidence by continuously testing in production to assert the health of a cloud-native system and by placing our focus on the mean time to recovery.</p>
<p><a href="5c400ff6-91da-4782-9369-549622d4a0d1.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Designing for Failure</em>, deals with techniques, such as backpressure, idempotency, and the Stream Circuit Breaker pattern, for increasing the robustness and resilience of autonomous services.</p>
<p><a href="b2c8b5bd-dfe5-461e-a8fa-3e71c94e633c.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Optimizing Performance</em>, explores techniques, such as asynchronous non-blocking IO, session consistency, and function tuning, for boosting the responsiveness of autonomous services.</p>
<p><a href="7ddedd13-fcee-4091-8566-02c9814cb782.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Deploying to Multiple Regions</em>, demonstrates how to deploy global autonomous services that maximize availability and minimize latency by creating fully replicated, active-active deployments across regions and implementing regional failover.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "The first thing to note is that we must define <kbd>runtime: nodejs8.10</kbd> in the <kbd>serverless.yml</kbd> file."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px">module.exports.hello = (event, context, callback) =&gt; {<br/>  console.log('event: %j', event);<br/>  console.log('env: %j', process.env);<br/>  <br/>  callback(null, 'success');<br/>};</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px">service: cncb-create-function<br/>...<br/><strong>functions</strong>:<br/>  hello:<br/>    handler: handler.<strong>hello</strong></pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>$ npm run dp:lcl -- -s $MY_STAGE</strong><strong><br/></strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Select <span class="packt_screen">Monitors</span> | <span class="packt_screen">New Monitor</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Event</span></span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
