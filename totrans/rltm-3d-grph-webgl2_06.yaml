    stacks, animation timers, and various interpolation techniques. In this chapter,
    we start by examining how colors are structured and handled in WebGL and ESSL.
    We will discuss the use of colors in objects, lights, and scenes. Then, we will
    see how WebGL leverages the depth buffer for object occlusion when one object
    is in front of another, blocking it from view. Lastly, we will cover alpha blending,
    which allows us to combine the colors of objects when one is occluding the other,
    while also allowing us to create translucent objects.

    of `0.0` to `1.0`, just like the other three channels (red, green, and blue).

    opaque color will have an alpha value of `1.0`, whereas a completely transparent
    color will have an alpha value of `0.0`. This is the general case, but as we will

    depth value. Though fragments are two-dimensional since they’re rendered on the
    screen, the depth value keeps the information of how far the fragment is from
    the camera (screen). Depth values are stored in a special WebGL buffer named **depth
    buffer** or **z-buffer**. The `z` comes from the fact that `x` and `y` values
    correspond to the screen coordinates of the fragment, while the `z` value measures
    distance perpendicular to the screen.
