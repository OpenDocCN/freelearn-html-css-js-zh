There are frameworks you can use if you only want to manipulate the <a id="id0" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Document Object Model</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>DOM</strong></span>), frameworks used only for styling, frameworks for user-friendly components, frameworks used to design your project, and so on. Also there is Ext JS, a framework used to create <a id="id1" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Rich Internet Applications</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>RIA</strong></span>), but it has many other features than just pretty components.</p><p>In this book, we are going to learn how to develop an application from the beginning to the end with Ext JS 5, also covering some pieces of the backend required to make our application work. We will learn how to use Ext JS with hands-on examples covering some components, how they work, and how to use them in each chapter.</p><p>But first, you are going to learn what Ext JS is capable of if this is the first time you have come into contact with the framework.</p><div class="section" title="Understanding Sencha Ext JS"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec08"/>Understanding Sencha Ext JS</h1></div></div></div><p>Can<a id="id2" class="indexterm"/> we use Ext JS to manipulate DOM? Can we use it if we want pretty and user-friendly components (forms, grids, trees, and so on)? Can we use it if we need some nice charts? Can we use the <a id="id3" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Model View Controller</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>MVC</strong></span>) architecture to organize the application with Ext JS? What if we want to use a two-way data-binding between the Model and the View? Can we do that using Ext JS? And what if we do not like the colors of Ext JS components' look and feel? Can we easily change it too? And now a difficult one; can we make a build to obfuscate and optimize the CSS and JavaScript files of our application using Ext JS? Is Ext JS responsive? Can we use it in mobile devices?</p><p>Amazingly, the answer is positive to all the preceding questions! As we can see, Ext JS is a complete frontend framework. The <a id="id4" class="indexterm"/>mastermind company behind Ext JS is Sencha Inc. (<a class="ulink" href="http://sencha.com">http://sencha.com</a>).</p><p>Sencha Ext JS also has a cousin called<a id="id5" class="indexterm"/> <span class="strong"><strong>Sencha Touch</strong></span>. It also has the amazing features we just mentioned, but focuses on the mobile cross-platform world. We will talk very briefly about Ext JS and Sencha Touch in later chapters of this book.</p><div class="section" title="Architecture of Ext JS applications"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec07"/>Architecture of Ext JS applications</h2></div></div></div><p>Before <a id="id6" class="indexterm"/>we get started, let's make sure we understand a few of the core concepts. Ext JS is a frontend framework based on JavaScript and HTML5. This means Ext JS does not connect to the database directly. For storage, we can use one of the types of HTML5 storage, such as Web SQL or local storage, but these types of storage allow us to store only 5 MB of data, which is very little for a common application.</p><p>Usually, we want to use MySQL, Oracle, MS Server or any other database. To be able to store information in a database, we need to use a server-side language, such as PHP, Java, C#, Ruby, Python, Node.js, and so on. Ext JS will communicate with the server-side language (or web services), and the server will connect to the database or any other storage (documents repository, for example).</p><p>The following diagram exemplifies the architecture of an application developed with Ext JS:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0457OT_01_01.jpg" alt="Architecture of Ext JS applications"/></div></div></div></div>

<span class="strong"><strong>object-oriented</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>OO</strong></span>) approach. We declare classes with attributes known in Ext JS as configurations and methods (functions in JavaScript).</p><p>Ext JS also follows a naming convention. If you are familiar with OO programming, you are probably familiar with the naming conventions of Ext JS as well. For example, class names are alphanumeric, starting with an uppercase character, and and then the rest of the letters are in CamelCase. For example, if we want to create a class to represent the client details, we could name it <code class="literal">ClientDetails</code>. Method and attribute names start with a lowercase character and then the rest of the letters are in CamelCase. For example, <code class="literal">retrieveClientDetails()</code> is a good name for a method and <code class="literal">clientName</code> is a good name for an attribute.</p><p>Ext JS is organized in packages as well. Packages are a way of organizing the code that has the same purpose. For example, in Ext JS, there is a package called <code class="literal">data</code> that handles everything related to data in the framework. There is a packaged named <code class="literal">grid</code> that contains all the code related to GridPanels.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note02"/>Note</h3><p>For more information about the class system, please read <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/5.0/core_concepts/classes.html">http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/5.0/core_concepts/classes.html</a>.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Components"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec10"/>Components</h2></div></div></div><p>The<a id="id14" class="indexterm"/> main reason some people consider using Ext JS is probably because of its rich and user-friendly components. Ext JS contains some of the most used components in web applications, such as forms, grids, and trees. We can also use charts that are touch-friendly (meaning they work on touchscreens as well) and the drawing package that uses all the advantages of <a id="id15" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Scalable Vector Graphics</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>SVG</strong></span>) and HTML5.</p><p>You can checkout the official <a id="id16" class="indexterm"/>Sencha Ext JS examples page at <a class="ulink" href="http://dev.sencha.com/extjs/5.0.0/examples/index.html">http://dev.sencha.com/extjs/5.0.0/examples/index.html</a> to have an idea of what we can do with the examples.</p><div class="section" title="The component hierarchy"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec01"/>The component hierarchy</h3></div></div></div><p>You <a id="id17" class="indexterm"/>will notice that throughout this book, we will mention terms such as component, container, and widget. The following diagram exemplifies the component hierarchy in Ext JS:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0457OT_01_02.jpg" alt="The component hierarchy"/></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>Component</strong></span> class<a id="id18" class="indexterm"/> is the parent class for all Ext JS widgets. Below the <span class="strong"><strong>Component </strong></span>class, we have the <span class="strong"><strong>Container</strong></span> class. The <a id="id19" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Container</strong></span> class might contain other components. For example, let's take a look at the following GridPanel:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0457OT_01_03.jpg" alt="The component hierarchy"/></div><p>The <a id="id20" class="indexterm"/>
<code class="literal">Grid Panel</code> class<a id="id21" class="indexterm"/> extends from the <code class="literal">Panel</code> class, a very popular component in Ext JS. The <code class="literal">Panel</code> class supports headers, docked items (toolbars), and it contains a body space. Subclasses of the <code class="literal">Panel</code> class, such as <code class="literal">DataView</code>, <code class="literal">Tree</code>, <code class="literal">Grid</code>, and <code class="literal">Form</code>, are panels, but instead of the body, they have a specialized <code class="literal">View</code> class that is responsible for rendering the specific information. For example, the <code class="literal">View</code> class of a <code class="literal">Grid</code> panel is specialized in rendering the Grid Column; the <code class="literal">View</code> class of a <code class="literal">Tree</code> Panel is specialized in rendering hierarchical information, and the <code class="literal">View</code> class of a <code class="literal">Form</code> panel (called BasicForm) is specialized in rendering form fields.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="GridPanel"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec11"/>GridPanel</h2></div></div></div><p>The<a id="id22" class="indexterm"/> grid component<a id="id23" class="indexterm"/> is one of the most used components in web applications. It is used to display tabular data.</p><p>To create a grid, the developer needs to declare at least two configurations: <code class="literal">columns</code> and <code class="literal">Store</code>. The <code class="literal">Store</code> class organizes a collection of data in Ext JS, and it is responsible for feeding the grid with the information to be displayed. We will explore it when we discuss the data package.</p><p>The grid component can be used as a plain and simple data grid, with only the information records <a id="id24" class="indexterm"/>being displayed. Or, if we have a large amount of data, we can use its paging capabilities, or we can also use a Big Data Grid if we really have a large amount of data. There are also other features such as grouped header grid (also known as Pivot Grid); we <a id="id25" class="indexterm"/>can also have a grid with locked columns or even with widgets, such as chats, as demonstrated by the previous screenshot. Among other features, we can also sort and filter the information inside the grid and use some of its plugins to accomplish tasks such as expanding the rows to display more information without popups, using checkboxes to select rows and automatic numbered rows as well. And there is more: the grid component also supports editing by opening a small pop-up row so that you can edit the information directly in the grid. The grid also supports cell editing, which is similar to what we can do in MS Excel—edit the information by double-clicking on a cell.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note03"/>Note</h3><p>For more information, please take a look at <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/5.0/apidocs/#!/api/Ext.grid.Panel">http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/5.0/apidocs/#!/api/Ext.grid.Panel</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/5.0/components/grids/grids.html">http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/5.0/components/grids/grids.html</a>.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="TreePanel"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec12"/>TreePanel</h2></div></div></div><p>Trees<a id="id26" class="indexterm"/> display<a id="id27" class="indexterm"/> hierarchical data, such as a file directory. A tree's data comes from a TreeStore or is predefined in the <code class="literal">root</code> configuration. The tree also supports sorting and filtering, select a row using checkboxes, and we can also mix a tree with a grid and use the TreeGrid component.</p><p>It also supports plugins such as drag and drop between trees.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note04"/>Note</h3><p>For more information, please take a look at <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/5.0/apidocs/#!/api/Ext.tree.Panel">http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/5.0/apidocs/#!/api/Ext.tree.Panel</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/5.0/components/trees.html">http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/5.0/components/trees.html</a>.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Forms"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec13"/>Forms</h2></div></div></div><p>Next, we<a id="id28" class="indexterm"/> have <a id="id29" class="indexterm"/>the form component. We can implement powerful forms using text, area, and number fields. We can also use the date/month picker, checkboxes, radio buttons, comboboxes, and even file upload. All fields have the basic native validation support (with error messages to the user), such as mandatory fields and minimum and maximum value or length, but we can easily customize and create custom validation (IP address for example).</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note05"/>Note</h3><p>For more information, please take a look at <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/5.0/apidocs/#!/api/Ext.form.Panel">http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/5.0/apidocs/#!/api/Ext.form.Panel</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/5.0/components/forms.html">http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/5.0/components/forms.html</a>.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Other components"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec14"/>Other components</h2></div></div></div><p>We <a id="id30" class="indexterm"/>also have the charts. We can build column, bar, line, area, scatter, pie, radial, gauge, and even financial charts. We can have basic, stacked, multi-axis, and 3D charts as well. The charts are also fed by a Store.</p><p>And of course, there are basic components that will help our application look even better, such as menus, tabs, panels, windows, alerts, toolbars, and so on. The components have <span class="strong"><strong>Web Accessibility Initiative – Accessible Rich Internet Applications</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>WAI-ARIA)</strong></span> support<a id="id31" class="indexterm"/> and also support right-to-left languages.</p><p>Seems nice, right?

It also has a great layout manager (only when we create an Ext JS application using its base component, the Viewport. For components that are used in a standalone form (rendered in a <code class="literal">&lt;div&gt;</code> tag, the layout manager does not work when you decrease the size of the browser window).</p><p>Some of the layouts supported are Absolute layout (where we need to use the absolute <span class="emphasis"><em>x</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>y</em></span> positions of the component in the screen or within the component); Accordion layout, Border layout, Card layout, Center layout, Column layout, Fit layout, Hbox and VBox layouts, and Table layouts.</p><p>The layouts that are most used in applications are Border, Card, Fit, and HBox and VBox.

<code class="literal">data</code> package<a id="id35" class="indexterm"/> is one of the most important packages from the Ext JS SDK. Ext JS components such as grid, Tree, and even the Form are data-driven.</p><p>Server-side languages usually support data well. In Java, PHP, <span class="strong"><strong>C#</strong></span>, and other languages, we can create entities known as<a id="id36" class="indexterm"/> <span class="strong"><strong>Plain Old Java Object</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>POJOs</strong></span>), <span class="strong"><strong>Persistent Domain Objects</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>PDOs</strong></span>), and <span class="strong"><strong>Value Objects</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>VOs</strong></span>), and <a id="id37" class="indexterm"/>other names that we usually give<a id="id38" class="indexterm"/> to these entities. Ext JS supports data, so we represent entities<a id="id39" class="indexterm"/> in the frontend as well.</p><p>There are basically three major pieces:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Model</strong></span>: This <a id="id40" class="indexterm"/>represents the entity.

It can be Ajax, REST, JSONP, Memory, or HTML5 LocalStorage. Inside the proxy, we can define <code class="literal">Reader</code> and <code class="literal">Writer</code>. The <code class="literal">Reader</code> attribute is responsible for decoding the data we receive from the server (we can define it if it is JSON or XML, and we can also define its format). The <code class="literal">Writer</code> attribute is responsible for encoding the data to be sent to the server; it can be JSON or XML, and we can also define its format. The Proxy can be placed inside a Model or a Store.</li></ul></div><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note07"/>Note</h3><p>For more information please read <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/5.0/core_concepts/data_package.html">http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/5.0/core_concepts/data_package.html</a>.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="The MVC and MVVM architectures"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec17"/>The MVC and MVVM architectures</h2></div></div></div><p>While<a id="id43" class="indexterm"/> working <a id="id44" class="indexterm"/>with Ext JS, we<a id="id45" class="indexterm"/> can choose between two architectures for our frontend code: <span class="strong"><strong>Model</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>View</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>Controller</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>MVC</strong></span>) and<a id="id46" class="indexterm"/> <span class="strong"><strong>Model</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>View</strong></span> <span class="strong"><strong>ViewModel</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>MVVM</strong></span>).

Scroll until the end of the page and select <span class="strong"><strong>OPEN SOURCE GPL LICENSING</strong></span>, as demonstrated in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0457OT_01_05.jpg" alt="Downloading Ext JS and Sencha Cmd"/></div><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note11"/>Note</h3><p>The latest version of Ext JS at the time of writing this book is 5.1.</p></div></div><p>We also need to download and install Sencha Cmd<a id="id61" class="indexterm"/> from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.sencha.com/products/sencha-cmd/download">http://www.sencha.com/products/sencha-cmd/download</a>. Sencha Cmd is responsible for creating the application and making, building, and compiling Sass and Compass to generate the application's CSS. After the installation of Sencha Cmd, the <code class="literal">sencha</code> command will be available from the terminal application as well.</p><p>After downloading the Ext JS SDK, unzip it inside the Apache Xampp <code class="literal">htdocs</code> folder. Once we start the <a id="id62" class="indexterm"/>Apache server, we will be able to execute<a id="id63" class="indexterm"/> the Ext JS examples from our local environment:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0457OT_01_06.jpg" alt="Downloading Ext JS and Sencha Cmd"/></div></div><div class="section" title="Offline documentation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec21"/>Offline documentation</h2></div></div></div><p>While <a id="id64" class="indexterm"/>developing with Ext JS, we will consult the documentation a lot. Whenever we mention the name of an Ext JS component in this book, it is recommended that you go to the documentation and take a look at it. The Ext JS documentation<a id="id65" class="indexterm"/> is available at <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/5.0/">http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/5.0/</a>. It contains guides (it is also highly recommended that you spend some time reading the guides before diving into this book since the guides provide basic knowledge about the framework), and links to blog posts and also to the documentation itself. As we will consult it a lot, we recommend installing the documentation locally as well. To do so, go to <a class="ulink" href="http://docs.sencha.com/">http://docs.sencha.com/</a>, open the <span class="strong"><strong>Sencha Guides</strong></span> menu, and select the <span class="strong"><strong>offline docs</strong></span> link as demonstrated in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0457OT_01_07.jpg" alt="Offline documentation"/></div><p>Unzip the docs<a id="id66" class="indexterm"/> inside the Xampp <code class="literal">htdocs</code> folder as well and access your <code class="literal">localhost</code>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0457OT_01_08.jpg" alt="Offline documentation"/></div><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note12"/>Note</h3><p>A video tutorial with step-by-step instructions to set up the environment for Ext JS is available at <a class="ulink" href="http://youtu.be/B43bEnFBRRc">http://youtu.be/B43bEnFBRRc</a>.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="IDE"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec22"/>IDE</h2></div></div></div><p>You<a id="id67" class="indexterm"/> can use any<a id="id68" class="indexterm"/> IDE or editor of your preference to develop with Ext JS. There are a few editors that are very popular: Sublime Text, Atom, Eclipse (if you are a Java developer), Netbeans, and Visual Studio (if you are a C# developer), Notepad++, and WebStorm, among others.</p><p>If you are looking for the autocompleting feature, you can use the Sencha Eclipse Plugin that is part of Sencha Complete (paid) at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.sencha.com/products/complete/">http://www.sencha.com/products/complete/</a>) or you can use WebStorm (also paid) at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/</a>).</p><p>There is also Sencha Architect (which also has the autocompleting feature). It is a <span class="strong"><strong>what you see is what you get</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>WYSIWYG</strong></span>)<a id="id69" class="indexterm"/> editor and is a great Sencha tool that can be used with the IDE of your preference (to develop the server-side code of the application).</p><p>Feel free to use the editor or IDE you are most comfortable with to develop the source code of this book!</p></div></div>
