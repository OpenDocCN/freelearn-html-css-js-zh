- en: 'If you are an Ext JS developer, it probably took you a while to learn the framework.
    We know that the Ext JS learning curve is not short. After we have learned the
    basics, and we need to use Ext JS in our daily jobs, a lot of questions pop up:
    how can one component talk to another? What are the best practices? Is it really
    worth using this approach and not another one? Is there any other way I can implement
    the same feature? This is normal.'

    really nice applications with Ext JS? We are going to create a complete application,
    from the mockup of the screens all the way to putting it into production. We are
    going to create the application structure, a splash screen, a login screen, a
    multilingual capability, an activity monitor, a dynamic menu that depends on user
    permission, and modules to manage database information (simple and complex information).
    And then, we will learn how to build the application for production, how to customize
    the theme, and how to debug it.'

- en: We will use real-world examples and see how we can implement them using Ext
    JS components. And throughout the book, we've also included a lot of tips and
    best practices to help you boost your Ext JS knowledge and take you to the next
    level.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Sencha Ext JS Overview"), *Sencha Ext JS
    Overview*, introduces Sencha Ext JS and its capabilities. This chapter provides
    references that you can read before diving into the other chapters of this book.
    This is done taking into consideration the possibility that this is your first
    contact with the framework.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Getting Started"), *Getting Started*, introduces
    the application that is implemented throughout the book, its features, and the
    mockup of each screen and module (each chapter covers a different module), and
    also demonstrates how to create the structure of the application using Sencha
    Cmd and how to create a splash screen.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. The Login Page"), *The Login Page*, explains
    how to create a login page with Ext JS and how to handle it on the server side
    and also shows some extra capabilities, such as adding the Caps Lock warning message
    and submitting the login page when pressing the *Enter* key.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. The Logout and Multilingual Capabilities"),
    *The Logout and Multilingual Capabilities*, covers how to create the logout capability
    and also the client-side activity monitor timeout, which means if the user does
    not use the mouse or press any key on the keyboard, the system ends the session
    automatically and logs out. This chapter also provides an example of multilingual
    capability and shows how to create a component so that the user can use it to
    change the system''s language and locale settings.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Advanced Dynamic Menu"), *Advanced Dynamic
    Menu*, is about how to create a dynamic menu that depends on user permission.
    The options of the menu are rendered depending on whether the user has permission
    or not; if not, the option will not be displayed.'

- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Static Data Management"), *Static Data Management*,
    covers how to implement a module where the user is able to edit information as
    though they were editing information directly from a MySQL table. This chapter
    also explores capabilities such as live search, filter, and inline editing (using
    the Cell Editing and Row Editing plugins). Also, we start exploring real-world
    issues when we develop big applications with Ext JS, such as the reuse of components
    throughout the application.'

- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Content Management"), *Content Management*,
    further explores the complexity of managing information from a table of the database
    and all its relationships with other tables. So we cover how to manage complex
    information and how to handle associations within data Grids and FormPanels.'

    also covers charts and how to export them to image and PDF and also how to use
    third-party plugins.'

    *Routing, Touch Support, and Debugging*, demonstrates how to enable routing in
    the project; it is also about debugging Ext JS applications, including what we
    need to be careful about and why it is very important to know how to debug. We
    also quickly talk about transforming Ext JS projects into mobile apps (responsive
    design and touch support), a few helpful tools that can help you in your daily
    work as a developer, and also a few recommendations of where to find extra and
    open source plugins to use in Ext JS projects.'
