    building scalable and maintainable applications. Microservices architecture breaks
    down a monolithic application into smaller, independently deployable services
    that communicate with each other over a network.

    Node.js for microservices development. The infrastructure for microservices in
    Node.js should be designed carefully while considering factors such as scalability,
    reliability, security, and ease of maintenance. Node.js is a popular choice for
    implementing microservices due to its non-blocking, event-driven architecture,
    which aligns well with the demands of distributed systems. However, the choice
    of technologies and tools should be based on the specific requirements of your
    project.

    of microservices architecture. Load balancing ensures the efficient distribution
    of traffic and resource utilization, while service orchestration manages the coordination
    and execution of microservices to complete complex workflows and business processes.
    Together, these components contribute to the scalability, availability, and reliability
