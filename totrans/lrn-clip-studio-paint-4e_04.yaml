- en: In the analog world, drawings are made on paper or canvas with pencils, ink,
    paint, brushes, and many other tools. In the digital world, too, we have a myriad
    of tools—many that imitate real-world art supplies and techniques. In Clip Studio
    Paint, the bulk of these mark-making tools fall under the heading of brushes,
    which includes sub-categories such as pencils, pens, markers, pastels, oil paints,
    and more. We’re going to get familiar with the toolbox of brushes with sample
    images so that when we start drawing, we will be familiar with the default tools
    and how we can change them to suit our individual style of working.

- en: In the world of analog art, a brush is a very specific tool. In Clip Studio
    Paint, however, the word *brush* can refer to several different tools. Usually,
    we use the term *brush* to refer to a digital tool that is used with a stylus
    or mouse to draw lines, as opposed to other tools that fill colors or select or
    perform the other operations that can be performed in digital art.

    of the toolbar in the user interface. These tool icons are labeled as **Eraser**,
    **Pencil**, **Pen** (aka **Inking** tools), **Brush**, **Airbrush**, **Decoration**,
    and **Blend**. The icons for these tool categories are shown in the creenshot

    more precise thickness, depending on the pen pressure, and bolder lines with more
    variation, similar to what you would get using a traditional G-pen. Although both
    pens are pressure sensitive, the **Real G-Pen** tool creates more sensitive results
    and with more textures as you draw.

    look the most interesting to you to make marks on the canvas and test them out.
    One of the best things about doing digital art is how forgiving it is. If you
    don’t like a mark that you have made, it can always be erased or undone, so take
    this opportunity to play around and familiarize yourself with the tools

    a sketch layer, while we might want thinner lines to draw the detailed background
    sceneries or eyelashes. For these reasons, we can take control of the thickness
    of our mark-making tools. The **Brush Size** category has options related to the
    size of a brush or the line width.
  prefs: []

    to the right of the slider and using the number pad to enter the size manually,
    or by adjusting the brush size by using the up and down arrows to the right of
    the number display. The brush size can also be changed according to other factors,
    such as the pressure applied to the tablet stylus.

- en: Directly under the **Brush Size** slider, there are two checkboxes. The first
    is **Specify by size on screen**. When this option is activated, the size of the
    brush will not change according to the amount of zoom. Therefore, a tool that
    is *4.00* in size when the document is at 100% zoom will be the same size when
    the document is scaled up or down, instead of becoming larger or smaller as the
    zoom changes. The other checkbox is **At least 1 pixel**. This option ensures
    that the mark being made is at least one pixel, even if the pen pressure becomes
    so light that the line should be interrupted.

    about digital art is that almost nothing is permanent. If you make a mark with
    a pen, you can almost always undo it (or erase it). With Clip Studio Paint, if
    you make a change to a tool that you don’t like, you can always revert the tool
    to its initial settings. That said, let’s learn how to make a copy of an existing
    brush tool, make changes to the copy, and then make marks with the copy to see
