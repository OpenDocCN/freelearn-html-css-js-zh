<p class="mce-root">JavaScript has become one of the most important languages of today and tomorrow.<br/>
The rise of JavaScript in the past few years has been so drastic that it has become a powerful language in the development of modern web applications.</p>
<p class="mce-root">MEVN is one of the stacks for developing modern web applications in addition to MEAN and MERN. This book provides a step by step way of building a full-stack web application using the technology in MEVN, which is MongoDB, Express.js, Vue.js, and Node.js.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The book will provide the basic concepts of Node.js and MongoDB, continuing with building an Express.js application and implementing Vue.js.</p>
<p>In this book, we'll cover the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li class="mce-root">Learning about the technology stack—MongoDB, Node.js, Express.js, and Vue.js</li>
<li class="mce-root">Building an Express.js application</li>
<li class="mce-root">Learning what REST APIs are and how to implement them</li>
<li class="mce-root">Learning to use Vue.js as the frontend layer in the Express.js application</li>
<li class="mce-root">Adding an authentication layer in the application</li>
<li class="mce-root">Adding the automation scripts and tests</li>
</ul>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Conventions used</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in the text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>A module is something that can be loaded by Node.js with a </span><kbd>require</kbd><span> command and has a namespace. A module has a</span><span> </span><kbd>package.json</kbd><span> </span><span>file associated with it.</span>"</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>extends layout<br/><br/>block content<br/>  h1= title<br/>  p Welcome to #{title}</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>var index = require('./routes/index');<br/>var users = require('./routes/users');<br/><br/>var app = express();<br/><br/><strong>// Require file system module</strong><br/><strong>var fs = require('file-system');</strong></pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>$ mkdir css</strong><br/><strong>$ cd css</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Just hit <span class="packt_screen">Continue</span> until the installation completes.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
