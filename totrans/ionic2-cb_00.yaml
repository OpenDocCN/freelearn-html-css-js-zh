- en: The world of mobile development is fragmented, with many platforms, frameworks,
    and technologies. Ionic is intended to fill that gap, with its open source HTML5
    mobile app framework that lets developers build native-feeling apps using web
    technologies such as HTML, CSS, and AngularJS. Ionic makes it easy for frontend
    developers to become app developers. The framework provides superior performance
    with deep Cordova integration and a comprehensive set of tools for prototyping,
    backend support, and deployment.

- en: This book will take you through the process of developing a cross-platform mobile
    app using just HTML5 and Javascript based on Ionic 2, which is the latest version
    of Ionic using the Angular 2 framework. You will start by getting familiar with
    the CLI and learning how to build and run an app. You will touch on common features
    of real-world mobile applications, such as authenticating a user, getting data,
    and saving data using either Firebase or local storage. Next, the book will explain
    how Ionic integrates with Cordova to support native device features using ngCordova
    and take advantage of the existing modules around its ecosystem. You will also
    explore advanced topics of extending Ionic to create new components. Finally,
    the book will show you how to customize the Ionic theme and build an app for all
    platforms.
