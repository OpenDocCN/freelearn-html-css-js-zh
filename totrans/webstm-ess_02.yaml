    with the world of WebStorm. You have not just learned about a couple of basic
    things, but also created a simple project using several features so you now have
    the first-hand elementary experience of using WebStorm, and now it is time to
    go further and cultivate your skills.

    of flexible settings for doing this. It means that you are able to customize each
    particle of the code appearance completely up to your preferences. You are enabled
    to customize highlighting for JavaScript and CoffeeScript and TypeScript, CSS
    and SASS/SCSS, JSON and XML and YAML, and so on.

    signs, variable and function declarations—you can change its appearance—bold or
    italic, the color of the foreground and background, font effects, and much more.
    Below the configuration panel, you can find a preview panel where you can observe
    all the changes you performed in real time. Besides, if you know what code unit
    you would like to customize but don't know what it is called, you can simply click
    on any sign or word of the code in the preview panel, and it will be automatically
    chosen in the list of code unit names, as well as all occurrences of the same
    type of unit get to blink so you can see what you are choosing.

    and will highlight the code accordingly. So, for example, if you are writing JavaScript
    code inside an HTML file, WebStorm will be able to detect this and highlight your
    code correctly.

- en: WebStorm will perform static code analysis on your code on the fly. The editor
    will check the code, based on the language used, and the rules you specify and
    highlight warnings and errors as you type. This is a very powerful feature that
    means you don't need to have an external linter and will catch most errors quickly,
    thus making a dynamic and complex language like JavaScript more predictable and
    easy to use.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Runtime error and any other error, such as syntax or performance, are two things
    to consider. To investigate the first one, you need tests or a debugger, and it
    is obvious that they have almost nothing in common with the IDE itself (although,
    when these facilities are integrated into the IDE, such a synergy is better, but
    that is not it). You can also examine the second type of errors the same way,
    but is it convenient? Just imagine that you need to run tests after writing the
    next line of code. It is no go! Won''t it be more efficient and helpful to use
    something that keeps an eye on and analyzes each word being typed in order to
    notify you about probable performance issues and bugs, code style and workflow
    issues, various validation issues, warn of dead code and other likely execution
    issues before executing the code, to say nothing of reporting inadvertent misprints.
    WebStorm is the best fit for it. It performs a deep-level analysis of each line,
    each word in the code. Moreover, you needn''t break off your developing process

    use to strongly improve your efficiency and save a lot of time.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    analyzes and processes the code of the whole project, and smartly suggests the
    pieces of code appropriate in the current context, and even more—alongside the
    method names you can find the usage of these methods. Of course, code completion
    itself is not a fresh innovation, but WebStorm performs it in a much smarter way
    than other IDEs do. WebStorm can auto-complete a lot things: Class and function
    names, keywords and parameters, types and properties, punctuation, and even file
    paths.'

    in the current context, keep on typing the next letters. Besides typing only initial
    consecutive letter of the method, you can either type something from the middle
    of the method name, or even use the CamelCase style, which is usually the quickest

    it will be applied at all these positions. For example, you need to add different
    background colors for each table cell, and then make them of twenty-pixel width.
    In this case, you don''t need to perform these identical tasks repeatedly and

    so you can continue typing. As cell widths are arranged to be fixed-sized, simply

    You may instantly think of using a simple replace feature but you needn''t replace
    all attribute occurrences, only several consecutive ones. For doing this, you
    can place the cursor on the first attribute, which you are going to perform changes
    from, and click *Ctrl* + *G* on Mac or *Alt* + *J* on Windows as many times as

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Throughout the development process, it is almost unavoidable that you have to
    use refactoring. Also, the bigger code base you have, the more difficult it becomes
    to control the code, and when you need to refactor some code, you will most likely
    be up against some issues relating to, for example, naming omission or not taking
    into consideration function usage. You learned that WebStorm performs a thorough
    code analysis so it understands what is connected with what and, if some changes
    occur, it collates them and decides what is acceptable, and what is not to perform
    in the rest of the code. Let us try a simple example.

  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: You decided to rename the `id` attribute's value of the input element to `search_field`
    because it is less confusing. You could simply rename it here but after that you
    would have to manually find all the occurrences of the word `search` in the code.
    It is evident that the word is rather frequent so you would spend a lot of time
    recognizing usage cases appropriate in the current context or not. And there is
    a high probability that you would forget something important, and even more time
    will be spent on investigating an issue. Instead, you can entrust WebStorm with
    this task. Select the code unit to refactor (in our case, it is the `search` value
    of the `id` attribute), and click *Ctrl* + *T* on Mac or *Ctrl* + *Alt* + *Shift*
    + *T* on Windows (or simply click the **Refactor** menu item) to call the **Refactor
    This** dialog. There, choose the **Rename…** item and enter the new name for the
    selected code unit (`search_field` in our case). To get only a preview of what
    will happen during the refactoring process, click the **Preview** button, and
    all the changes to apply will be displayed in the bottom. You can walk through
    the hierarchical tree and either apply the change by clicking the **Do Refactor**
    button, or not. If you need a preview, you can simply click the **Refactor** button.
    What you will see is that the `id` attribute got the `search_field` value, not
    the type or placeholder values, even if they have the same value, and in the JavaScript
    file you got `getElementById('search_field')`.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note that even though WebStorm can perform various smart tasks, it still remains
    a program, and some issues can be caused by so-called artificial intelligence
    imperfection, so you should always be careful when performing the refactoring.
    In particular, manually check the `var` declarations because WebStorm sometimes
    can apply the changes to them as well, but it is not always necessary because
    of the scope.
