- en: Simplicity is the shortest path to a solution. Meteor is a web development framework
    that simplifies programming and once it is mastered, gives the developer the power
    to prototype applications in just a few days and build a production app in just
    a few weeks. The simplicity of the framework makes maintenance a breeze as well;
    reorganizing and renaming files will not break your code, code is easy to keep
    in modules, and virtual environments are a thing of the past. The Meteor Development
    Group has established the shortest path for web development by producing a feature-rich
    framework that takes all the experience learned from other frameworks and packs
    it into Meteor.

- en: While Meteor is simple because of the technical features it comes packed with,
    it is clear that the framework will become the status quo because of how the team
    behind it works. Meteor is built by a team that has been actively funded since
    the beginning of the project, unlike many open source frameworks such as Ruby
    on Rails, Laravel, CakePHP, and others. This means that the people working towards
    building the framework actually care about it. Yet, Meteor is an open source project
    with an active community that has been improving the project constantly through
    packages or by patching the core code.
