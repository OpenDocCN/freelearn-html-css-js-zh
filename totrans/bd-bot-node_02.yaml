    of software and a reliable platform that is used by millions of people worldwide
    in order to make calls, organize meetings, and chat with each other. It is used
    for both personal communication as well as for business.'

    VoIP calls with any other user that also has a Skype account. It also allows you
    to call phone numbers at very cheap rates and even for free to some locations.
  id: totrans-2

    number or divert them to become text messages. It also allows message forwarding,
    conferencing, group chatting, file transferring, remote desktop presentation,
    viewing, and many other features.

    what about using Skype as an automated agent that can help to get some work done
    and could automate some business processes, in order to make our lives easier?
    Is this even possible?
  id: totrans-4
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The good news is that, indeed, it is possible. Skype is now part of Microsoft
    ([https://www.microsoft.com/en-in](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in)/) and, recently,
    at the build developer's event, a framework for creating interactive bots with
    Skype was unveiled. Skype already has a set of cool and extremely useful APIs,
    which make it relatively easy for developers to interact with the service, and
    is great for all sorts of voice and chat-related applications. However, it does
    not have an API that is solely focused on interactive messaging automation and
    this is where the **Bot Framework** ( [https://dev.botframework.com](https://dev.botframework.com)
    ) comes in to fill the void.

    Skype bot that acts like a virtual **Human Resources** (**HR**) assistant, which
    should be able to provide information about vacation days, notice periods, and
    other HR-related queries.

- en: A Skype bot is, in essence, just another Skype contact; the difference is that,
    instead of talking to another person, it's an automated process that knows how
    to reply to the input you provide. Bots can do many things, such as fetch the
    news, check the weather, retrieve photos or information from websites, start a
    game, or order food or a taxi for you.
  id: totrans-9
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Anything that can be turned into a service can be converted into an automated
    conversation by using a bot. With Skype, bots can have interactive conversations
    on nearly every platform, at any time, and from anywhere.
  id: totrans-10
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Users can send a Skype bot request, and your bot can send back meaningful feedback
    based on the content received. A Skype bot can also be part of a group conversation
    and send details to all the parties involved in that group.
  id: totrans-11
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The way a Skype bot technically works is that it connects and listens to the
    bot platform using the Skype bot API directly, or using the C# or Node.js SDK.
    We'll obviously focus our attention on the Node.js SDK.
  id: totrans-12

- en: When a user sends a message to your Skype bot, we route this activity to a **Webhook**
    ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook)
    ) that is defined for the bot. The bot then sends replies back to the bot platform,
    which passes them on to the user. The Webhooks (which are valid public URLs-HTTP
    Messaging endpoints) will typically run on a cloud service such as **Microsoft**
    **Azure** ( [https://azure.microsoft.com](https://azure.microsoft.com) ).

    to a limited number of users for development, which allows the bot details to
    be edited, and also allows for previewing features such as group chat or calling.
    In the example we will build in this chapter, we will focus on chatting (text
    interaction) and not calling, but it is useful to know that this feature is also
    possible. Here are the stages:'
