<p class="mce-root">We now have our running Aurelia application and know all the basic principles of JavaScript programming. Our <span class="packt_screen">Hello World!</span> message appears on screen, but don't you think it is a little simple and static? In this chapter, we will explore how to add style to our application using modern tools such as SASS and LESS. Also, we will talk about the most important styling libraries used nowadays such as Bootstrap, Semantic UI, and Material Design. Finally, with all this previous learning, let's make our application look cool, awesome, and attractive by configuring our project to use the Aurelia-Materialize plugin. Some of the tools we are going to use for this purpose are:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSS preprocessors: SASS, LESS</li>
<li>Task automation tools: Gulp</li>
<li>CSS libraries: Bootstrap, Material Design, Semantic UI</li>
</ul>
<p>Sounds exciting? We know yes, first we need to start talking about CSS, have you heard about it before? Don't worry, we will explain it in a brief but consistent way. Just CSS is not so awesome, so we will introduce you to some tools to make your style sheets awesome! Tools such SASS and LESS are very useful to these purposes, but we need to run some commands each time we need to use it, so we will also talk about task automation tools. No more manual repetitive commands! Finally, we don't need to reinvent the wheel. We have CSS libraries with different design templates, each one oriented to different concepts and purposes. Last, but not least, we will practice configuring our previously created application with all these awesome tools to make our development process more friendly and interesting. <span>We are sure you will find this chapter really interesting and useful, so let's start!</span></p>

<p class="mce-root">Basically, CSS is a language structure that describes the style of some HTML file (can also be used for XML), defining how it should be displayed. This structure allows developers to manage the behavior on one or multiple web pages; any change performed on some CSS element will be reflected in all HTML elements linked to it.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">How does it work?</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>CSS is based on rules. These rules are defined on <kbd>.css</kbd> files, called <strong>style sheet</strong>. Style sheets can be composed of one or more rules, applied to one HTML or XML document; the rule has two parts: selector and declaration:</p>
<pre>h4 { color : red}</pre>
<div>
<p>The <kbd>h4</kbd> element is the selector, and <kbd>{ color : red }</kbd> is the declaration.</p>
<p>The selector works as a link between the document and the style, specifying the elements that will be affected by that declaration. The statement is the part of the rule that states what the effect will be. In the previous example, selector <kbd>h4</kbd> indicates that all elements <kbd>h4</kbd> will be affected by the declaration stating that the color property will have the network value (red) for all elements <kbd>h4</kbd> of the document or documents that are linked to that style sheet.</p>
</div>
<p>We have three ways to link our style sheet with the HTML file.</p>
<p>The first option is to use the <kbd>&lt;link&gt;</kbd> element, on the <kbd>&lt;head&gt;</kbd> section of the HTML file. We just need to specify the absolute or relative path/URL of our style sheet to import into our web page:</p>
<pre><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE </span><span>html</span><span>&gt;</span><br/><span>&lt;</span><span>html </span><span>lang=</span><span>"en"</span><span>&gt;</span><br/><span>&lt;</span><span>head</span><span>&gt;</span><br/> <span>&lt;</span><span>title</span><span>&gt;</span>Aurelia is Awesome<span>&lt;/</span><span>title</span><span>&gt;</span><br/> <strong>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://www.w3.org/css/officeFloats.css" /&gt;</strong><br/><span>&lt;/</span><span>head</span><span>&gt;</span><br/><span>&lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;</span><br/>.<br/>.<br/><span>&lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;</span><br/><span>&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;</span></pre>
<p>Next, we can use the <kbd>&lt;style&gt;</kbd> element of the HTML file, generally in the <kbd>&lt;head&gt;</kbd> section too. It will be loaded when our file is called by the application:</p>
<pre><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE </span><span>html</span><span>&gt;</span><br/><span>&lt;</span><span>html </span><span>lang=</span><span>"en"</span><span>&gt;</span><br/><span>&lt;</span><span>head</span><span>&gt;</span><br/>   <strong> &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;</strong><br/>       <strong> body {</strong><br/><strong>            padding-left: 11em;</strong><br/><strong>            font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", serif;</strong><br/><strong>            color: red;</strong><br/><strong>            background-color: #d8da3d;</strong><br/><strong>        }</strong><br/><strong>        h1 {</strong><br/><strong>            font-family: Helvetica, Geneva, Arial, sans-serif;</strong><br/><strong>        }</strong><br/>    <strong>&lt;/style&gt;</strong><br/><span>&lt;/</span><span>head</span><span>&gt;</span><br/><span>&lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;</span><br/> <span>&lt;!--Here the styles will be applied--&gt;<br/></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;</span><br/><span>&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;</span></pre>
<p>Alternatively, we can style the HTML directly using the <kbd>style</kbd> flag:</p>
<pre><span>&lt;!DOCTYPE </span><span>html</span><span>&gt;</span><br/><span>&lt;</span><span>html </span><span>lang=</span><span>"en"</span><span>&gt;</span><br/><span>&lt;</span><span>head</span><span>&gt;</span><br/>    <span>&lt;!--Nothing here--&gt;<br/></span><span>&lt;/</span><span>head</span><span>&gt;</span><br/><span>&lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;</span><br/>    <span>&lt;</span><span>h1 </span><strong>style="color: blue"</strong><span>&gt;</span>Aurelia is awesome!<span>&lt;/</span><span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span><br/><span>&lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;</span><br/><span>&lt;/</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;</span></pre>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>We were reviewing some of the most basic CSS concepts, just to refresh our knowledge about the syntax and elements that compose a style sheet. In the real world, a style sheet could have more than 20 classes belonging to one HTML page; in extreme cases, these classes could be one hundred or more. In these cases, maybe you will find CSS syntax very primitive, not auto-explanatory, and incomplete in some cases. It's hard to implement inheritance on big systems and over time, it could become hard to maintain.<br/>
You can apply different approaches in order to write better CSS code, you can define different classes for each web page and then import them on one single CSS file, or maybe you could define parent classes and apply inheritance to child elements, but, in both cases, you will need to deal with maintainability problems.</p>
<p>It's just for the reason that in order to write better CSS code, reuse code in an effective way, and add some extra approaches to make it more dynamic and understandable to any developer, CSS preprocessors become a very used tool for any developer, increasing their productivity and <span>drastically</span> reducing the amount of code in our style sheets.<br/>
As we can expect, each CSS preprocessor has its own syntax, not too different and not hard to learn. All of them support classic CSS; the extra features will be explained as we move on using the two most used tools nowadays—SASS and LESS.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Variables</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Imagine that you are coding the web page for your company; you define the style sheet, and, of course, you have a font standard color for all titles, body text, and so on. You are writing your CSS classes and notes that you need to repeat the same color value on more than one class definition. Okay, it’s not so hard to copy and paste the same value across my entire file. You finally present that web page to your UX designer and oh, surprise! That red doesn’t have to be so deep. You need to correct to the new color code. What does that mean? You will need to dive into your style sheet and manually <span>change</span> each color value for the new one.</p>
<p>Like other programming languages, with CSS preprocessors, we can define variables to reuse them across our style sheet, avoid repeating the same value, and save time when we need to adjust or change that same value. Let’s look at an example:</p>
<p class="mce-root">SASS syntax:</p>
<pre>$my-<span>height</span>: 160px;<br/><br/>div {<br/>  height: $my-height;<br/>}</pre>
<p>Then, LESS syntax:</p>
<pre>@<span>my-height</span>: 160px;<br/><br/>div {<br/>  font-size: @my-height;<br/>}</pre>
<p>They're pretty similar right? Let's explore other features!</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Nesting</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p class="mce-root">Nesting elements in pure CSS are a bad deal. They are not friendly, are hard to read, and make us write and repeat a lot of code. Using a CSS preprocessor, you will provide a more friendly reading to any developer; the code auto explains what the CSS is doing and how the classes inherit from others. Look at the magic:</p>
<p class="mce-root">Using the SASS syntax:</p>
<pre><span>$my-link-color</span>: <span>#FF0000</span>;<br/><span>$my-link-hover</span>: <span>#00FFFF</span>;<br/><br/><span>ul </span>{<br/>  <span>margin</span>: <span>0</span>;<br/><br/>  <span>li </span>{<br/>    <span>float</span>: <span>left</span>;<br/>  }<br/><br/>  <span>a </span>{<br/>    <span>color</span>: <span>$my-link-color</span>;<br/><br/>    <span>&amp;</span>:<span>hover </span>{<br/>      <span>color</span>: <span>$my-link-hover</span>;<br/>    }<br/>  }<br/>}</pre>
<p>Using the same in LESS:</p>
<pre><span>@my-link-color</span>: <span>#FF0000</span>;<br/><span>@my-link-hover</span>: <span>#00FF00</span>;<br/><br/><span>ul </span>{<br/>  <span>margin</span>: <span>0</span>;<br/><br/>  <span>li </span>{<br/>    <span>float</span>: <span>left</span>;<br/>  }<br/><br/>  <span>a </span>{<br/>    <span>color</span>: <span>@my-link-color</span>;<br/><br/>    <span>&amp;</span>:<span>hover </span>{<br/>      <span>color</span>: <span>@my-link-hover</span>;<br/>    }<br/>  }<br/>}</pre>
<p>One thing you need to know is that the browser does not <span>directly</span> interpret the SASS or LESS syntax. Do you need to convert your code to normal CSS syntax, how could <span>you</span> perform it? In the case of SASS, just type the following command:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><strong>$ sass --watch app/sass:public/stylesheets</strong></pre>
<p>They both export the same CSS output:</p>
<pre><span>ul </span>{ <span>margin</span>: <span>0</span>; }<br/><span>ul li </span>{ <span>float</span>: <span>left</span>; }<br/><span>ul a </span>{ <span>color</span>: <span>#999</span>; }<br/><span>ul a</span>:<span>hover </span>{ <span>color</span>: <span>#229ed3</span>; }</pre>
<p>As you can see, CSS preprocessors provide us a more friendly readability and quick understanding of what the code is doing.</p>

<p class="mce-root">Sometimes, you define various classes that share a common definition. With the <kbd>@extend</kbd> feature, you can define a common class and make others extend from it instead of copying the same code in each one:</p>
<p>SASS example:</p>
<pre>.<span>block </span>{ <span>margin</span>: 25<span>px </span><span>58</span><span>px</span>; }<br/><br/><span>p </span>{<br/>  <span>@extend </span>.<span>block</span>;<br/>  <span>border</span>: 3<span>px solid </span><span>#00FF00</span>;<br/>}<br/><br/><span>ol </span>{<br/>  <span>@extend </span>.<span>block</span>;<br/>  <span>color</span>: <span>#FF0000</span>;<br/>  <span>text-transform</span>: <span>lowercase</span>;<br/>}</pre>
<p class="mce-root">LESS:</p>
<pre>.<span>block </span>{ <span>margin</span>: 25<span>px </span><span>58</span><span>px</span>; }<br/><br/><span>p </span>{<br/>  <span>&amp;</span>:<span>extend</span>(.<span>block</span>);<br/>  <span>border</span>: 3<span>px solid </span><span>#00FF00</span>;<br/>}<br/><br/><span>ol </span>{<br/>  <span>&amp;</span>:<span>extend</span>(.<span>block</span>);<br/>  <span>color</span>: <span>#FF0000</span>;<br/>  <span>text-transform</span>: lowe<span>rcase</span>;<br/>}</pre>
<p class="mce-root">CSS output:</p>
<pre>.<span>block</span>, <span>p</span>, <span>ul</span>, <span>ol </span>{ <span>margin</span>: <span>10</span><span>px </span><span>5</span><span>px</span>; }<br/><br/><span>p </span>{ <span>border</span>: <span>1</span><span>px solid </span><span>#eee</span>; }<br/><span>ul</span>, <span>ol </span>{ <span>color</span>: <span>#333</span>; <span>text-transform</span>: <span>uppercase</span>; }</pre>

            <article>
                
<p class="mce-root">Oh, please, this is a really awesome feature! With this feature, you will be able to control the aspect of your page in a reactive way, based on determined conditions.</p>
<p>SASS example:</p>
<pre><span>@if lightness</span>(<span>$my-color</span>) &gt; 9<span>0</span>% {<br/>  <span>background-color</span>: <span>#FF0000</span>;<br/>}<br/><br/><span>@else </span>{<br/>  <span>background-color</span>: #00FF00;<br/>}</pre>
<p>In LESS, the things are not similar. You need to use CSS guards:</p>
<pre>.<span>mixin</span><span> </span>(<span>@my-color</span>) <span>when </span>(<span>lightness</span>(<span>@my-color</span>) &gt;8<span>0</span>%) {<br/>  <span>background-color</span>: <span>#00FF00</span>;<br/>}<br/>.<span>mixin </span>(<span>@my-color</span>) <span>when </span>(<span>lightness</span>(<span>@my-color</span>) =&lt; <span>80</span>%) {<br/>  <span>background-color</span>: <span>#FF0000</span>;<br/>}</pre>
<p>These are not all the preprocessor features, but at this moment, they're enough to start working on our FIFA World Cup application!</p>

<p>In the previous section, we learned how to use a CSS preprocessor and how to compile this SASS/LESS code into pure CSS to be interpreted by the browser. Note that each time you make a change, you will need to recompile the entire file, which means that you will need to type the same command and do the same task one, two, and several times. Yes, it's really boring. Fortunately, we have task automation tools. What does <span>that</span> mean? Some other tool will do the dirty job for us.</p>

                </header>

<p>Gulp is an open source JavaScript-based task runner, which uses code-over-configuration approach to define its tasks. These could be the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bundling and minifying libraries and style sheets</li>
<li>Refreshing your browser when you save a file</li>
<li>Quickly running unit tests</li>
<li>Running code analysis</li>
<li>LESS/SASS to CSS compilation</li>
<li>Copying modified files to an output directory</li>
</ul>
<p>This tool uses the stream module of Node.js; first of all, we need to define what a stream is. It can be defined as a tool that allows data reading on one file and takes it to another place through pipes methods. The principal feature of Gulp.js is that it does not write files/folders into the hard drive, like other automation tools. That's a good feature, because we can configure several tasks, and it won't impact our computer performance.</p>

<p>As we said before, Gulp does not write anything on the hard drive. So, all operations are performed at the filesystem level. It observes the file preconfigured to check for any change (read) and after some edition, it will rewrite the compiled content linked with another file, or execute some preconfigured command.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Installing Gulp</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Gulp is available on Windows, Linux, and macOS. The installation process is very similar in any of these operating systems, and the only difference is that you need to run the installation command as administrator <span>on UNIX-based platforms</span>. You need to have already installed Node and NPM on your PC. To install, type the next command:</p>
<pre><strong>$ npm install –g gulp</strong></pre>
<p>Let's wait some minutes after the installation process finishes and then verify that all its okay:</p>
<pre><strong>$ gulp –v</strong><br/><br/><strong>CLI Version 3.9.0</strong></pre>
<div>
<p>That's all! We now <span>have</span> Gulp installed and ready to automate tasks!</p>
<p>First of all, you need to ensure that your web project is already configured to import <kbd>npm</kbd> modules; if no <kbd>package.json</kbd> file exists, you must create one with the <kbd>npm init</kbd> command. To start working with Gulp, just type the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>$ npm install --save-dev gulp</strong></pre>
<p>This will install gulp node module locally on your project. Remember that the <kbd>--save-dev</kbd> flag lets <kbd>npm</kbd> update its <kbd>package.json</kbd> file in the <kbd>devDependencies</kbd> section to be resolved only on development time.</p>
<p>The next step is to create the <kbd>gulpfile</kbd>. This file will act as manifest to define the tasks we want to execute. All of them should be defined in this file; let's go through an example:</p>
<pre><span>// gulpfile.js<br/>var </span><span>gulp </span>= require(<span>'gulp'</span>);<br/><br/><span>gulp</span>.task(<span>'hello-world'</span>, <span>function</span>(){<br/>    <span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>'hello world'</span>);<br/>});</pre></div>
<p class="mce-root"><kbd>require</kbd> is a node function to add a reference to a module. Since we are referencing the gulp module, we are able to use this task automation method.</p>
<p>Now, when we run the <kbd>gulp hello-world</kbd> <span>command</span> from the command line, the task automation tool will search on the <kbd>gulpfile</kbd> the task matching by name and execute it.</p>
<p>Gulp provides three primary task methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>gulp.task</kbd>: To define a new task with a name, array dependencies, and the function to execute</li>
<li><kbd>gulp.src</kbd>: It sets the folder where the source files are located</li>
<li><kbd>gulp.dest</kbd>: It sets the destination folder where build files will be placed</li>
</ul>
<p>Gulp can be configured to execute any task, such as image transformation, JavaScript files transpiling, concatenation, and case processing. Let's see some more advanced examples.</p>

<p>We will configure an automated task to transform our created SCSS files into CSS. This code can be implemented in any web project (with gulp dependencies preconfigured, of course):</p>

<p><kbd>gulp-sass</kbd> is a customized plugin for gulp to work with SASS files.</p>
<p>After importing the <kbd>npm</kbd> modules into our project, let's reference them into our <kbd>gulpfile</kbd>:</p>
<pre class=" language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">var</span> gulp <span class="token operator">=</span> require<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'gulp'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>
<span class="token keyword">var</span> sass <span class="token operator">=</span> require<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'gulp-sass'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></pre>
<p>Then, we need to create a new task. Let's call it <kbd>process-styles</kbd>:</p>
<pre class=" language-javascript"><span class="token comment">// SCSS processing</span>
gulp<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">task</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'process-styles'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>gulp<span class="token punctuation">.</span>src<span class="token punctuation">(</span>'sass<span class="token comment">/**/</span><span class="token operator">*</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>scss'<span class="token punctuation">)</span>
        <span class="token punctuation">.</span>pipe<span class="token punctuation">(</span>sass<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>on<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'error'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> sass<span class="token punctuation">.</span>logError<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
        <span class="token punctuation">.</span>pipe<span class="token punctuation">(</span>gulp<span class="token punctuation">.</span>dest<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'./css/'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></pre>
<p>Note that we use the <kbd>pipe()</kbd> method to call any extra plugins between the <kbd>.src()</kbd> and the <kbd>.dest()</kbd> sections. The code is so self-explanatory, we are just passing the route where the <kbd>gulp</kbd> <kbd>task</kbd> will find the files to be converted, then configuring a fault behavior if some error is raised and if everything is okay, we just specify the route of our generated files.</p>

<p>At this point, we have some task compressed into a single file. All this compression will be performed when we run the <kbd>gulp</kbd> command. We can group the preconfigured task to be run into one single command. Suppose we have three tasks already defined: <kbd>process-styles</kbd>, <kbd>other-task</kbd>, and <kbd>some-other-task</kbd>. Now we just need to define all these tasks into a single new task:</p>
<pre class=" language-javascript"><span class="token comment">// run all tasks</span>
gulp.task('run', ['process-styles', 'other-task', 'some-other-task']);</pre>
<p>Save and press <em>Enter</em> the <kbd>gulp run</kbd> command line to execute all the tasks defined.</p>
<p>That's great, but we still need to enter commands manually. <span>Rumpelstiltskin, t</span>hat was not part of the deal! Don't worry, we have one last surprise for you—<kbd>gulp.watch()</kbd>. With this method, you could monitor your source files and execute some task when a change is detected. Let's configure <kbd>watch</kbd> task into our <kbd>gulpfile</kbd>:</p>
<pre class=" language-javascript"><span class="token comment">// watch for changes in code</span>
gulp<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">task</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'watch'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token keyword">function</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
  // some example tasks
  <span class="token comment">// detect image changes</span>

  <span class="token comment">// detect html changes</span>
  gulp<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">watch</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>folder<span class="token punctuation">.</span>src <span class="token operator">+</span> <span class="token string">'html/**/*'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token string">'html-task'</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

  <span class="token comment">// detect javascript changes</span>
  gulp<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">watch</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>folder<span class="token punctuation">.</span>src <span class="token operator">+</span> <span class="token string">'js/**/*'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">[<span class="token string">'js-task'</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

  <span class="token comment">// detect css changes &lt;--- Our created task</span>
  gulp<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">watch</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>folder<span class="token punctuation">.</span>src <span class="token operator">+</span> <span class="token string">'scss/**/*'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token string">'process-styles'</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;<br/></span>  .<br/>  .<br/>  .<br/>  // And so many task as we need to watch! 

<span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></span></pre>
<p>Finally, rather than running <kbd>gulp</kbd> <kbd>watch</kbd> task manually, let's configure a default task:</p>
<pre class=" language-javascript">gulp<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">task</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'default'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token string">'run'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">'watch'</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span></pre>
<p>Save, and then just run the command <kbd>gulp</kbd> into your terminal. You will note that a <kbd>gulp</kbd> observer is always looking if any change is performed in the files preconfigured! Of course, it includes all your <kbd>.scss</kbd> files! Now you can change and add new styles and view it automatically reflected in your browser, without the need to execute some command by yourself. If you want to terminate this watch process, just type <em>Ctrl</em> + <em>C</em> to abort monitoring and return to the command line. Now you really have a strong task automation tool configured and ready for use! The Aurelia CLI preconfigures <kbd>gulp</kbd> <kbd>task</kbd> activities for you, but it's very important to know how it works behind the scenes; also, you are able to modify this configuration and add custom behavior if you consider it needed.</p>

<p>We are ready to start writing our first HTML elements and add style to the application. There are common elements that can be repeated in more than one application: tables, grids, input tags, select, and so on. We can define our own, but you should keep in mind that all of these elements need to be standardized, and defining it from zero can become a difficult task. <span>Today,</span> we have many HTML libraries and templates to start developing our view layer and add custom behavior to satisfy our own needs. Let's explore the three most used HTML, JS, and CSS libraries.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Bootstrap</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Bootstrap is one of the most popular and complete frontend libraries. It is composed of HTML templates, predefined CSS classes, and JavaScript files to add a more dynamic behavior to each component. Created by <span>Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter and then released as open source project in August 2011, Bootstrap was one of the first libraries providing custom elements and a grid system to design responsive webs. What does responsive mean? Responsive web design is about creating websites that automatically adjust themselves to look good on all devices, from small phones to large desktops.</span></p>
<p>The grid is the most important aspect of this framework. It defines the bases in which the layout is created. Bootstrap implements five tiers or scales based on the screen width. <span>Customize the size of your columns on extra small, small, medium, large, or extra large devices, however you see fit. For grids that are the same from the smallest of devices to the largest, use the <kbd>.col</kbd> and <kbd>.col-*</kbd> classes. Specify a numbered class when you need a particularly sized column; otherwise, feel free to stick to <kbd>.col</kbd>. Let's look at an example for a small screen:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/3c39b813-4edf-47ef-8f74-ea9262c064ba.png" style="width:68.75em;height:16.50em;"/></div>
<p>Here, keep the following in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>.col-sm-1</kbd> will fit 1/12 of the <span>screen</span> width</li>
<li><kbd>.col-sm-2</kbd> will fit 1/6 of the <span>screen</span><span> </span>width</li>
<li><span><kbd>.col-sm-4</kbd> will fit 1/3 of the screen width</span></li>
<li><span><kbd>.col-sm-6</kbd> will fit 1/2 of the screen width</span></li>
<li><span><kbd>.col-sm-12</kbd> will fit the entire screen width</span></li>
</ul>
<p>In the same way, Bootstrap includes a vast variety of preconfigured classes to simplify the alignment of our HTML elements, making our web application look ordered and attractive. Another thing we really like about bootstrap is the high customization level. We can transform all their components, adding custom behavior or style, and it will not generate any conflict with the existing library. An advanced design with some elements customized could look like this:</p>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/b41b1682-e420-4fec-8eda-054a0965ba2e.png" style="width:56.00em;height:39.58em;"/></div>
<p>Doesn't care the purpose, Bootstrap is created to provide a highly customizable solution for any business need you might have. Let's explore more libraries!</p>

<p>Powered by Google, Material Design is more than just a CSS/JS library. It's a complete philosophy design, based on shapes, shadows, and transitions. Material Design is based on three main principles.</p>

<p>Consider all the space around you as a motion system. You can touch it, you can feel it, and see how it can change their aspect when you interact. Plain surfaces, paper, and colors are common in our daily lifestyle, and Material uses these attributes to create an intuitive and familiar interface to the final user, providing a big superset of animations without breaking the rules of physics.</p>

<p>Pleasing to the eyes, Material Design is not intrusive or aggressive. It implements a hierarchy meaning based on colors, scales, and white spaces, inviting the user to interact with the web interface.</p>

<p>Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design. Action and reaction rules, <span>serving to focus attention and maintain continuity.</span></p>
<p>As we said before, Material is not a library, but many libraries are based on Material, and one of the most used nowadays is Materialize. This library provides all features like others, such as grid systems, prebuilt components, and custom behavior, with the difference that all of it is created by following Material Design principles. Let's look at an example of web pages developed using Materialize:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/d034b647-eb59-4846-8399-b1e2832724d6.png" style="width:58.75em;height:31.92em;"/></div>
<p>As you can see, the Material interface is simple, clean, and self-explanatory.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The new guy in the neighborhood, Semantic comes with tons of unique new features based on modals, accordion elements, 3D transformations, even ratings, and so on.</p>
<div class="packt_quote"><br/>
"Semantic empowers designers and developers by creating a shared vocabulary for UI."</div>
<div class="packt_quote">                                                                                                            - Semantic UI Team</div>
<p>Why <em>Semantic</em>? It's because it provides class names that sound really natural in common English language instead of random class names, and, of course, it describes what the CSS classes are doing to the HTML element.</p>
<p>Let's see how the implementation differs from other frontend libraries; on Bootstrap, <span>the names of CSS classes are very friendly for humans to read:</span></p>
<pre><span>&lt;</span><span>div </span><span>data-role=</span><span>"header"</span><span>&gt;</span><br/>    <span>&lt;</span><span>a </span><span>href=</span><span>"#"<br/></span><span>       </span><strong>class="ui-btn-left ui-btn ui-btn-inline ui-mini ui-corner-all ui-btn-icon-left ui-icon-delete"&gt;Cancel&lt;/a&gt;</strong><br/>    <span>&lt;</span><span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span>My App<span>&lt;/</span><span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span><br/>   <strong> &lt;button class="ui-btn-right ui-btn ui-btn-b ui-btn-inline ui-mini ui-corner-all ui-btn-icon-right ui-icon-check"&gt;</strong><br/>        Save<br/>    <span>&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span><br/><span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></pre>
<p>Using the Semantic UI library, <span>classes use human words. That's very friendly! Coding is more like writing regular text:</span></p>
<pre><span>&lt;</span><span>div </span><span>class=</span><span>"ui stackable inverted divided equal height stackable grid"</span><span>&gt;</span></pre>
<p>Semantic UI comes with a lot of themes, and they are easy to configure. For example, the following screenshot shows a web page developed using Semantic UI:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/7d4eabda-922a-4cf1-ace2-5b7d9001100c.png"/></div>

<p>All the mentioned libraries are mobile-first based. What does that mean? Let's keep exploring!</p>

<p>Mobile-first is a relatively new way to design web pages, facilitating the responsiveness starting always by the small screen devices, such as mobile phones or tablets. When you start designing, you must have a close idea of where your product will be displayed.</p>
<p>Now, it's time to choose a frontend library to start creating our first project components. In our opinion, Material Design can give a more natural feel to the final user and looks great on mobile devices (Android UI is based on Material). Bootstrap can be a good option too, still looking like a common web page on small screens. The same goes for Semantic UI, but this one has transitions and animations that we will really miss. So, let's start configuring our project with Materialize library.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>As we said in the last section, Material Design is not a library. However, many libraries are based on Material philosophy, so we will choose Materialize CSS. Their components look very natural, and the best part is that Aurelia has its own implementation of this library called Aurelia-Materialize, which will facilitate us a lot in the development process and integration.</p>
<p>Let's open our created FIFA World Cup application and set the Terminal into the root folder; then we need to install some dependencies. Execute the following commands in the next order:</p>
<ul>
<li class="_17r7t1h"><kbd><span>$ au install jquery</span></kbd></li>
<li class="_17r7t1h"><kbd><span>$ au install tslib</span></kbd></li>
<li class="_17r7t1h"><kbd><span>$ au install materialize-amd</span></kbd></li>
<li class="_17r7t1h"><kbd><span>$ au install aurelia-materialize-bridge</span></kbd></li>
</ul>
<p>In our <kbd>index.html</kbd> file, lets include the Material Design icons to be imported into our project:</p>
<div><kbd><span>&lt;link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet"&gt;</span></kbd></div>
<p>Next, in our <kbd>main.js</kbd> file, we need to configure our new plugin:</p>
<div><kbd><span>aurelia.use.plugin('aurelia-materialize-bridge', b =&gt; b.useAll().preventWavesAttach());</span></kbd></div>
<p>The <span><kbd>b =&gt; b.useAll()</kbd> script allows us to load all Aurelia-materialize components into our project. If you only need a few of them, you can specify each one in the next way:</span></p>
<div>
<pre class="_17r7t1h"><span><span class="prism-token token punctuation">.</span><span class="prism-token token 1 function">plugin</span><span class="prism-token token 2 punctuation">(</span><span class="prism-token token 3 string">'aurelia-materialize-bridge'</span><span class="prism-token token 4 punctuation">,</span><span class="prism-token token 5"> bridge </span><span class="prism-token token 6 operator">=&gt;</span><span class="prism-token token 7"> </span><span class="prism-token token 8 punctuation">{<br/></span></span><span><span class="prism-token token 9">    bridge<br/></span></span><span><span class="prism-token token 10 punctuation">        .</span><span class="prism-token token 11 function">useButton</span><span class="prism-token token 12 punctuation">(</span><span class="prism-token token 13 punctuation">)<br/>        </span></span><span><span class="prism-token token 15 punctuation">.</span><span class="prism-token token 16 function">useCollapsible</span><span class="prism-token token 17 punctuation">(</span><span class="prism-token token 18 punctuation">)<br/>        </span></span><span><span class="prism-token token 20 punctuation">.</span><span class="prism-token token 21 function">useModal</span><span class="prism-token token 22 punctuation">(</span><span class="prism-token token 23 punctuation">)    <br/><span><span class="prism-token token 25 punctuation">        .</span><span class="prism-token token 26 function">useTabs</span><span class="prism-token token 27 punctuation">(</span><span class="prism-token token 28 punctuation">)   <br/>        </span></span><span><span class="prism-token token 30 punctuation">.</span><span class="prism-token token 31 function">useWaves</span><span class="prism-token token 32 punctuation">(</span><span class="prism-token token 33 punctuation">)</span><span class="prism-token token 34 punctuation">.</span><span class="prism-token token 35 function">preventWavesAttach</span><span class="prism-token token 36 punctuation">(</span><span class="prism-token token 37 punctuation">)</span><span class="prism-token token 38 punctuation">;<br/></span></span><span><span class="prism-token token 40 punctuation">}</span><span class="prism-token token 41 punctuation">)</span><span class="prism-token token 42 punctuation">;</span></span><br/></span></span></pre></div>
<div>Then, we need to add our generated <kbd>.css</kbd> to the <kbd>index.html</kbd> file:</div>
<div><kbd><span><span class="prism-token token tag tag punctuation">&lt;</span></span><span><span class="prism-token token tag tag">link</span></span> <span><span class="prism-token token tag attr-name">rel</span></span><span><span class="prism-token token tag attr-value punctuation">="</span></span><span><span class="prism-token token tag attr-value">stylesheet</span></span><span><span class="prism-token token tag attr-value punctuation">"</span></span> <span><span class="prism-token token tag attr-name">href</span></span><span><span class="prism-token token tag attr-value punctuation">="</span></span><span><span class="prism-token token tag attr-value">styles/css/materialize.min.css</span></span><span><span class="prism-token token tag attr-value punctuation">"</span></span><span><span class="prism-token token tag punctuation">&gt;</span></span></kbd></div>
<div class="packt_tip packt_infobox">Since we have the Aurelia CLI installed from the previous chapter, we are using this feature to get the new dependencies. Make sure you have at least the <span><kbd>0.32.0</kbd> version.</span></div>
<p><span>You are done! We are finally ready to start developing our generated, configured, and running web application.</span></p>
<p><span>At this point, your application folder should contain the following (or similar)</span> <span>project structure</span><span>:</span></p>

<p>In this chapter, we learned how to style our Aurelia application using CSS. Also, we explored the two most popular CSS preprocessors—LESS and SASS. We saw how these preprocessors help us develop more powerful style sheets using variables and extensions.</p>
<p>We explored how to automate tasks using Gulp. Gulp is used by the Aurelia CLI to execute all the tasks related to it.</p>
<p>Lastly, we went through different CSS Frameworks and explored and configured Google's Material Design Framework. We used Material Design to create our example application and take advantage of the most common UI elements.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will see how to apply testing in our code by adopting Test-Driven-Development in our development process. Keep reading!</p>
