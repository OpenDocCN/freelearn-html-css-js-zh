Meteor is a web development framework that simplifies programming and once it is mastered, gives the developer the power to prototype applications in just a few days and build a production app in just a few weeks. The simplicity of the framework makes maintenance a breeze as well; reorganizing and renaming files will not break your code, code is easy to keep in modules, and virtual environments are a thing of the past. The Meteor Development Group has established the shortest path for web development by producing a feature-rich framework that takes all the experience learned from other frameworks and packs it into Meteor.</p><p class="calibre7">While Meteor is simple because of the technical features it comes packed with, it is clear that the framework will become the status quo because of how the team behind it works. Meteor is built by a team that has been actively funded since the beginning of the project, unlike many open source frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, Laravel, CakePHP, and others. This means that the people working towards building the framework actually care about it. Yet, Meteor is an open source project with an active community that has been improving the project constantly through packages or by patching the core code.</p><div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div></div></div>

<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 3. Front-end Patterns" href="part0027_split_000.html#page">Chapter 3</a>, <em class="calibre11">Front-end Patterns</em>, covers a handful of patterns to improve your frontend code. You will learn how to keep code from repeating and keep it modular, use different kinds of variables, create custom input elements, animations, and more.</p><p class="calibre7">
<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 4. Application Patterns" href="part0035_split_000.html#page">Chapter 4</a>, <em class="calibre11">Application Patterns</em>, covers more complex patterns that help to control how data flows into the client, how to keep this data secure, and how to connect with external APIs.</p><p class="calibre7">
