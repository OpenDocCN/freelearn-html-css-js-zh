    that enabled us to create a list of interesting things we wanted to do in our
    lifetime. In this chapter, we will create a new application called "The London
    Tourist" application. It is an application that will display a list of top tourist
    attractions in the city of London in England. We will build this application with
    a new type of Ionic template called the side menu template. We will also be using
    the Angular `$http` service to query our data via Ajax.

    attract tourists around the world. The city is very urban but it has many historical
    and non-historical tourist attractions. With this large number of attractions,
    it can be difficult to pick out the best places to go. This is the entire idea
    behind the London Tourist App as it will provide users with five handpicked destinations
    that tourists visiting London can actually visit. These destinations will be stored
    in a JSON file in our project that we will be querying via AJAX and populating.

    elements and we have the ability to specify whether the menu is placed on the
    left, right, or even both. There are a lot of cool and powerful controls that
    the `<ion-side-menus>` elements let us utilize to control its containing items.

    navigation buttons of the main content area with the`<ion-nav-buttons>` element
    as its child element. For example, within these`<ion-nav-buttons>` elements, you
    can see a navigation button on line 8-9, which has a `menu-toggle` attribute of
    value `left`. This is simply saying that when this button is tapped, the left-sided
    side menu should be triggered. Remember that there can be up to two side menus
    with one being on the left and one being on the right in a side menu app.
  id: totrans-51
  prefs: []

- en: The second direct child element is the`<ion-nav-view>` element on line 12 from
    the preceding screenshot. We talked about this same element earlier when we had
    a look at the `index.html` file. This element is a placeholder for where the actual
    content is injected. This particular `<ion-nav-view>` element has a `name` attribute
    with the value of `menuContent`. This attribute is important as it is used like
    a value to uniquely identify`<ion-nav-view>`.

    attribute with value `left`. This is basically saying that we want this particular
    side menu to be on the left-hand side. Remember that we can have up to two side
    menus in our app, and one can be positioned on the left and another on the right,
    but two side menus cannot be positioned on the same side. We can also see that
    this `<ion-side-menu>` has two direct child elements. These child elements are
    `<ion-header-bar>` and `<ion-content>`. `<ion-header-bar>` is an element used
    to construct the header of a side menu. If you have a look at the following screenshot

    is something that we used to build our Bucket-List application from [Chapter 4](part0024_split_000.html#MSDG2-798adc86542b445d8a1bb648e10b6714

    The first thing we need to do is to clear all the code within the controller.
    Basically, we need to delete all the code found within the controller. If you
    have done this correctly, your controller should now look similar to what we have
    in the following screenshot:'

    database with the angular `$http` service. The first thing we need to do to achieve
    this is to first add the dependency of our `$http` service to our controller.
    This step is very important as if we do not add this dependency correctly, our
    app will not load. To do this, simply add `$http` as the second parameter in the
    anonymous function part of your controller definition. If you have done this correctly,
    you should see something similar to what I have in the following screenshot:'

    simply initializing the variable `sites` as an array to the `$scope`. It is a
    good practice to always initialize your Angular `$scope` variables before using
    them. The next thing we try to do is make an Ajax `get` request using the shorthand
    `$http.get()` method. This `$http.get` method returns a promise so we handle this
    promise by using the `.then()` method of promise handling of Angular. In the promise
    handler function, you can see that we start by setting the data property of the
    response from the promise (`response.data`). This `data` property of the promise
    response (`response.data`) is the property that holds any data returned which
    in our case is the data from our `sites.json` file.

    of the `$http.get()` function, which takes the URL of the API or the file we want
    to consume, we have provided the following relative path`'/sites.json'`. You might
    be wondering why we have not correctly given a path relative to the `controller.js`
    file. This is because when working with Angular, all paths are referenced from
    the root `index.html` file. In our case, the `sites.json` and `index.html` files
    are in the same directory under the `www` directory, which is why we do not have
    the path `'../sites.json'`, and instead have the path`'/sites.json'`.

- en: In this chapter, we learned how to create an Ionic application based on the
    side menu template. We used this knowledge to create our London Tourist Application.
    We also had a look at the code that makes up an Ionic side menu template and learned
    about the building block elements of a side menu application. We rounded up by
    querying some data via Ajax using the Angular `$http` service and rendered our
    tourist destinations.
