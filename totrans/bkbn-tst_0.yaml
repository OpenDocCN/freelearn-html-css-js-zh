- en: JavaScript web applications are soaring in popularity and driving exciting new
    application possibilities across the Internet. One of the most ubiquitous frameworks
    leading this charge is Backbone.js, which provides a modern and rational approach
    for organizing JavaScript applications.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At the same time, testing client-side JavaScript and Backbone.js applications
    remains a difficult and tedious undertaking. Even experienced developers can stumble
    across issues related to browser idiosyncrasies, complex DOM interactions, and
    asynchronous application behavior when writing frontend tests.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Backbone.js Testing* brings sensible practices and current techniques to the
    challenges of Backbone.js test development. You will be introduced to fundamental
    testing concepts, a contemporary frontend test infrastructure, and practical exercises
    on all facets of Backbone.js application development. This book covers topics
    ranging from basic test suite creation to using test doubles to tackle even the
    most difficult/least testable Backbone.js application components.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With a little guidance from this book, you can test your Backbone.js web applications
    easily, quickly, and with confidence.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Setting Up a Test Infrastructure"), *Setting
    Up a Test Infrastructure*, starts with the basics of how to set up your test application
    code and obtain the test libraries that we will use throughout this book. We create
    a basic test infrastructure, write the first tests, and review the test report
    results.'

    *Creating a Backbone.js Application Test Plan*, begins with a refresher of Backbone.js
    fundamentals, introduces a sample web application for the book, and discusses
    a wide range of relevant testing and planning concepts. We conclude by writing
    and running our first Backbone.js application tests.'

    Assertions, Specs, and Suites*, covers the basics of writing Backbone.js test
    suites and specs with Mocha and test assertions with Chai.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Test Spies"), *Test Spies*, introduces the
    Sinon.JS test double library and how to spy on application method behaviors in
    Backbone.js tests.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Test Stubs and Mocks"), *Test Stubs and Mocks*,
    dives deeper into Sinon.JS, with stubs and mocks that can replace application
    method behaviors. We examine how stubs and mocks can reduce application dependencies
    in tests and facilitate easier and more tractable Backbone.js application tests.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Automated Web Testing"), *Automated Web Testing*,
    enhances the test infrastructure built in the previous chapters to run automatically,
    for example, from the command line or a continuous integration server.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for JavaScript developers who are looking to create and implement
    test support for Backbone.js web applications. You should be comfortable with
    the JavaScript programming language and familiar with Backbone.js application
    development including the core components such as models, views, and routers,
    although you may be just learning the framework as you explore the testing topics
    of this book. Some exposure to testing methodology and technologies (in any language)
    would be helpful but not required.
