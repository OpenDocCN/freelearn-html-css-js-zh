			<p>In computer programming, paradigms abound. Some examples include imperative programming, structured (goto-less) programming, <strong class="bold">object-oriented programming</strong> (<strong class="bold">OOP</strong>), aspect-oriented programming, and declarative programming. Lately, there has been renewed interest in a particular paradigm that can arguably be considered to be older than most (if not all) of the cited ones—<strong class="bold">functional programming</strong> (<strong class="bold">FP</strong>). FP emphasizes writing functions and connecting them in simple ways to produce more understandable and more easily tested code. Thus, given the increased complexity of today’s web applications, it’s logical that a safer, cleaner way of programming would be of interest.</p>
			<p>This interest in FP comes hand in hand with the evolution of JavaScript. Despite its somewhat hasty creation (reportedly achieved in only 10 days, in 1995, by Brendan Eich at Netscape), today, JavaScript is a standardized and quickly growing language, with features more advanced than most other similarly popular languages. The ubiquity of the language, which can now be found in browsers, servers, mobile phones, and whatnot, has also impelled interest in better development strategies. Also, even if JavaScript wasn’t conceived as a functional language, the fact is that it provides all the features you’d require to work in that fashion, which is another plus.</p>
			<p>That said, we must also comment on advances in the language and related tools. The benefits of data typing are generally acknowledged, and in recent years, TypeScript has gained wide adoption and has been used for both frontend and backend coding. It makes sense, then, to also include its usage in this book. This, we feel, will make the examples clearer, and also simplify the adoption of the presented code for “real-life” jobs.</p>
			<p>It must also be said that FP hasn’t been generally applied in industry, possibly because it has a certain aura of difficulty, and it is thought to be theoretical rather than practical, even mathematical, and possibly uses vocabulary and concepts that are foreign to developers—for example, functors, monads, folding, and category theory. While learning all this theory will certainly be of help, it can also be argued that even with zero knowledge of the previous terms, you can understand the tenets of FP, and see how to apply it to your own programming.</p>
			<p>FP is not something that you have to do on your own, without any help. There are many libraries and frameworks that incorporate, to greater or lesser degrees, the concepts of FP. Starting with jQuery (which does include some FP concepts), passing through Underscore and its close relative, Lodash, and other libraries such as Ramda, and getting to more complete web development tools such as React and Redux, Angular, and Elm (a 100% functional language, which compiles into JavaScript), the list of functional aids for your coding is ever growing.</p>
			<p>Learning how to use FP can be a worthwhile investment, and even though you may not get to use all of its methods and techniques, just starting to apply some of them will pay dividends in better code. You need not try to apply all the concepts of FP from the start, and you need not try to abandon every non-functional feature in JavaScript either. JavaScript assuredly has some bad features, but it also has several very good and powerful ones. The idea is not to throw away everything you’ve learned and use and adopt a 100% functional way; rather, the guiding idea is evolution, not revolution. In that sense, it can be said that what we’ll be doing is not FP, but rather <strong class="bold">Sorta Functional Programming</strong> (<strong class="bold">SFP</strong>), aiming for a fusion of paradigms.</p>
			<p>A final comment about the style of the code in this book—it is quite true that there are several very good libraries that provide you with FP tools: Underscore, Lodash, and Ramda are counted among them. However, I preferred to eschew their usage because I wanted to show how things really work. It’s easy to apply a given function from some package or the other, but by coding everything out (vanilla FP, if you wish), it’s my belief that you get to understand things more deeply. Also, as I will comment in some places, because of the power and clarity of arrow functions and other features, the pure JavaScript versions can be even simpler to understand!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is geared toward programmers with a good working knowledge of JavaScript (or, better yet, TypeScript) working either on the client side (browsers) or the server side (Node.js), who are interested in applying techniques to be able to write better, testable, understandable, and maintainable code. Some background in computer science (including, for example, data structures) and good programming practices will also come in handy. In this book, we’ll cover FP in a practical way, though, at times, we will mention some theoretical points.</p>

			<p>I have tried to keep the examples in this book simple and down to earth because I want to focus on the functional aspects and not on the intricacies of this or that problem. Some programming texts are geared toward learning, say, a given framework, and then working on a given problem, showing how to fully work it out with the chosen tools.</p>
			<p>In fact, in the very early stages of planning for this book, I entertained the idea of developing an application that would use all the FP things I had in mind, but there was no way to fit all of that within a single project. Exaggerating a bit, I felt like an MD trying to find a patient on whom to apply all of his medical knowledge and treatments! So, I opted to show plenty of individual techniques, which can be used in multiple situations. Rather than building a house, I want to show you how to put bricks together, how to wire things up, and so on, so that you will be able to apply whatever you need as you see fit.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>To understand the concepts and code in this book, you don’t need much more than a JavaScript environment and a text editor. To be honest, I even developed some of the examples working fully online, with tools such as JSFiddle (at <a href="http://jsfiddle.net">jsfiddle.net</a>) and the like, and absolutely nothing else.</p>
			<p>In this book, we’ll be using ES2022 and Node 19, and the code will run on any OS, such as Linux, macOS, or Windows.</p>
			<p>You will need some experience with the latest version of JavaScript because it includes several features that can help you write more concise and compact code. We will frequently include pointers to online documentation, such as the documentation available on the <strong class="bold">Mozilla Development Network</strong> (<strong class="bold">MDN</strong>) at <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org">developer.mozilla.org</a>, to help you get more in-depth knowledge.</p>
			<p>We’ll also be using the latest version of TypeScript, to add data typing to our JavaScript code. For more on the language, the must-read reference is <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org">www.typescriptlang.org</a>, where you’ll find documentation, tutorials, and even an online playground to directly test code there.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-12"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"/>Conventions used</h1>
			<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
			<p><code>Code in text</code>: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. Here is an example: “There are several possible results: a single value with the <code>reduce()</code> operation, a new array with <code>map()</code>, or just about any kind of result with <code>forEach()</code>.”</p>

			<pre class="source-code">
// reverse.ts
const reverseString = (str: string): string =&gt; {

console.log(reverseString("MONTEVIDEO"));	// OEDIVETNOM</pre>
			<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
// continued...
const reverseString2 = (str: string): string =&gt;
  <strong class="bold">str.split("").reduceRight((x, y) =&gt; x + y, "")</strong>;
console.log(reverseString2("OEDIVETNOM")); // MONTEVIDEO</pre>
			<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
			<pre class="console">
