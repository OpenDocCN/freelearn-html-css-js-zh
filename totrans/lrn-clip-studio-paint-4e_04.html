<h1 class="chapterTitle" id="_idParaDest-71">Introducing Clip Studio Paint Brushes</h1>
<p class="normal">In the analog world, drawings are made on paper or canvas with pencils, ink, paint, brushes, and many other tools. In the digital world, too, we have a myriad of tools—many that imitate real-world art supplies and techniques. In Clip Studio Paint, the bulk of these mark-making tools fall under the heading of brushes, which includes sub-categories such as pencils, pens, markers, pastels, oil paints, and more. We’re going to get familiar with the toolbox of brushes with sample images so that when we start drawing, we will be familiar with the default tools and how we can change them to suit our individual style of working.</p>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Understanding the categories of Clip Studio Paint brushes and navigating them</li>
<li class="bulletList">An introduction to the Clip Studio Paint brush engine</li>
<li class="bulletList">Exploring the tool properties and settings</li>
<li class="bulletList">Copying, saving, and restoring brushes</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Let’s jump right into learning about these versatile digital art tools!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-72">Technical requirements</h1>
<p class="normal">To get started, you need Clip Studio Paint already installed on your device, and then you need to open a new blank canvas. Any size is fine, but I recommend creating a 300 dpi square canvas to go through the content in this chapter.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-73">Navigating the brushes</h1>
<p class="normal">In the world of <a id="_idIndexMarker189"/>analog art, a brush is a very specific tool. In Clip Studio Paint, however, the<a id="_idIndexMarker190"/> word <em class="italic">brush</em> can refer to several different tools. Usually, we use the term <em class="italic">brush</em> to refer to a digital tool that is used with a stylus or mouse to draw lines, as opposed to other tools that fill colors or select or perform the other operations that can be performed in digital art.</p>
<p class="normal">Most of the tools that we will refer to as brushes can be found in one section of the toolbar in the user interface. These tool icons are labeled as <strong class="screenText">Eraser</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Pencil</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Pen </strong>(aka<strong class="screenText"> Inking </strong>tools), <strong class="screenText">Brush</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Airbrush</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Decoration</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Blend</strong>. The icons for these tool categories are shown in the creenshot on the left:</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_04_4.1.png"/></p>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.1: Toolbar and art samples</p>
<p class="normal">Clicking on one<a id="_idIndexMarker191"/> of these icons in the toolbar results in a change in <a id="_idIndexMarker192"/>the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> palette.</p>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we’ll be closely looking at the most important paintbrush tools – in this case, Pen tools. When we click on the <em class="italic">Pen</em> icon in the toolbar, we can see the categories of pencils in the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> palette, as shown on the left of the following screenshot with inking and shading examples:</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_04_4.2.png"/></p>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.2: The Sub Tool palette</p>
<p class="normal">The buttons on the top of the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> palette show the different categories of tools available under the <strong class="screenText">Pen </strong>heading.</p>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Pen</strong> categories <a id="_idIndexMarker193"/>include <strong class="screenText">G-Pen</strong> and further down, <strong class="screenText">Real G-Pen</strong>. These <a id="_idIndexMarker194"/>tools are a collection of settings that change how the stylus interacts with the canvas and the look of the digital marks that are made. For instance, the following screenshot shows art that has been drawn with the <strong class="screenText">G-pen tool </strong>on the left and the <strong class="screenText">Real G-Pen</strong> tool on the right:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_04_4.3.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.3: Sample pen drawings</p>
<p class="normal">See the difference in<a id="_idIndexMarker195"/> the look of the lines? The <strong class="screenText">Real G-Pen</strong> tool produces <a id="_idIndexMarker196"/>more precise thickness, depending on the pen pressure, and bolder lines with more variation, similar to what you would get using a traditional G-pen. Although both pens are pressure sensitive, the <strong class="screenText">Real G-Pen</strong> tool creates more sensitive results and with more textures as you draw.</p>
<p class="normal">Take a moment now to look under each brush tool category and <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> category, and check out the different tools. Open a blank canvas and use the tools that look the most interesting to you to make marks on the canvas and test them out. One of the best things about doing digital art is how forgiving it is. If you don’t like a mark that you have made, it can always be erased or undone, so take this opportunity to play around and familiarize yourself with the tools</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_04_4.4.png"/></p>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.4: Sample brush drawings</p>
<p class="normal">When you’ve done<a id="_idIndexMarker197"/> that, let’s move on and become familiar with the<a id="_idIndexMarker198"/> brush engine, a powerful tool that allows you to customize your tools to suit your style!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-74">The brush engine</h1>
<p class="normal">Clip Studio Paint makes <a id="_idIndexMarker199"/>it easy to create your own tools with its powerful—but simple-to-use—brush engine. There are lots of options in the brush engine, such as brush size, shape, and how it’s corrected. But once you learn what each one does, it’s easy to make the best tools for your own needs. Let’s get started right away by looking at the brush options and<a id="_idIndexMarker200"/> learning what each one does.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-75">Accessing the brush options</h2>
<p class="normal">To access the<a id="_idIndexMarker201"/> options to create and change brushes, click on one of the brush tools. In this example, we’ll be<a id="_idIndexMarker202"/> looking at <strong class="screenText">G-pen</strong>, which is a sub tool under the <strong class="screenText">Pen</strong> tool. Once you have chosen a brush tool as your currently active tool, locate the <strong class="screenText">Tool Property</strong> palette. In the lower right-hand corner is an icon that looks like a wrench. Click on the wrench icon, which is displayed in the following screenshot, to open the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool Detail</strong> palette.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_04_4.5.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.5: The Sub Tool Detail icon</p>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool Detail</strong> palette is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_04_4.6.png"/></p>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.6: The Sub Tool Detail palette</p>
<p class="normal">The categories<a id="_idIndexMarker203"/> of<a id="_idIndexMarker204"/> options are listed on the left-hand side column, and the actual options to edit are shown on the right-hand side.</p>
<p class="normal">We’re going to discuss making a custom brush for special effects in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 9</em>, <em class="italic">Inking Special Effects</em>, so we’re going to cover more of these brush options in that chapter. In this chapter, we’re just going to get a feel for customizing the existing tools, so we’ll be covering the options that are most useful to tweak the feel and look of existing <a id="_idIndexMarker205"/>brushes. Now, let’s<a id="_idIndexMarker206"/> examine the options under the <strong class="screenText">Brush Size</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Ink</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Anti-aliasing</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Correction</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Starting and ending</strong> categories of options.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-76">Brush Size</h2>
<p class="normal">When we are drawing <a id="_idIndexMarker207"/>a rough sketch, we <a id="_idIndexMarker208"/>might want very thick pencil lines on a sketch layer, while we might want thinner lines to draw the detailed background sceneries or eyelashes. For these reasons, we can take control of the thickness of our mark-making tools. The <strong class="screenText">Brush Size</strong> category has options related to the size of a brush or the line width.</p>
<p class="normal">The size of the brush is set using the slider, by clicking on the current number to the right of the slider and using the number pad to enter the size manually, or by adjusting the brush size by using the up and down arrows to the right of the number display. The brush size can also be changed according to other factors, such as the pressure applied to the tablet stylus.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">There are more options in the brush engine that can also be adjusted according to source settings. Look for the rectangular button to the right of those options to access the source settings menu for them.</p>
<p class="normal">Directly under the <strong class="screenText">Brush Size</strong> slider, there are two checkboxes. The first is <strong class="screenText">Specify by size on screen</strong>. When this option is activated, the size of the brush will not change according to the amount of zoom. Therefore, a tool that is <em class="italic">4.00</em> in size when the document is at 100% zoom will be the same size when the document is scaled up or down, instead of becoming larger or smaller as the zoom changes. The other checkbox is <strong class="screenText">At least 1 pixel</strong>. This option ensures that the mark being made is at least one pixel, even if the pen pressure becomes so light that the <a id="_idIndexMarker209"/>line <a id="_idIndexMarker210"/>should be interrupted.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-77">Ink</h2>
<p class="normal">The next category of <a id="_idIndexMarker211"/>options is the <strong class="screenText">Ink</strong> category, which<a id="_idIndexMarker212"/> is related to the thickness and blending of the ink color. Here, you can find settings such as <strong class="screenText">Blending mode</strong>. This settings are quite advanced, and you can find<strong class="screenText"> </strong>out more about coloring in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 16</em>, <em class="italic">Using Clip Studio Paint to Color Your Manga</em>.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-78">Color Jitter</h2>
<p class="normal">Under the <strong class="screenText">Ink</strong> category, there <a id="_idIndexMarker213"/>is a <strong class="screenText">Color Jitter</strong> category, which <a id="_idIndexMarker214"/>can make the brush color vary in terms of its stroke. If the brush tip color is fixed, the <strong class="screenText">Color Jitter</strong> setting will not affect the brush color. The options are in the following screenshot on the right:</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_04_4.7.png"/></p>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.7: The Color Jitter category</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s have a look<a id="_idIndexMarker215"/> at each setting to <a id="_idIndexMarker216"/>see how it affects brush color:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Change brush tip color</strong> gives you control over the brush tip color dynamics settings, with four options when it’s turned on.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Randomize per stroke,</strong> when it’s turned on, gives you control in terms of randomizing the color of each stroke as you draw.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Let’s see the four options for each checkbox:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">The <strong class="screenText">Hue</strong> slider controls the degree of variation of the color to add to your brush stroke.</li>
<li class="bulletList">The <strong class="screenText">Saturation</strong> slider controls the vividness of the color to add to your brush stroke. Higher values result in more vivid colors.</li>
<li class="bulletList">The <strong class="screenText">Luminosity</strong> slider controls the value of the color mixed in your brush stroke.</li>
<li class="bulletList">The <strong class="screenText">Blend with sub color</strong> slider allows us to draw using a combination of the main drawing color and the sub-drawing color. The larger the value, the stronger the sub-drawing color becomes in the drawing.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Let’s have a look at some samples of the <strong class="screenText">Randomize per stroke</strong> settings:</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_04_4.8.png"/></p>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.8: Sample strokes of the various Randomize per stroke settings</p>
<p class="normal">You can see that <a id="_idIndexMarker217"/>each stroke changes its ink<a id="_idIndexMarker218"/> color, depending on the settings. I’ve written the setting name for each stroke, so you can see the effect that they have. In these examples, copper is the main color and white is the sub-color. You can enjoy discovering things through serendipity with this random color effect on your ink.</p>
<p class="normal">At the far right of each slider on the <strong class="screenText">Color Jitter</strong> settings, there are pen image icons. If you click one of them, a <strong class="screenText">Hue Dynamics</strong> sub-menu will appear, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_04_4.9.png"/></p>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.9: The Hue Dynamics palette</p>
<p class="normal">Each option controls <a id="_idIndexMarker219"/>how the input <a id="_idIndexMarker220"/>source affects the brush stroke color.</p>
<p class="normal">My favorite setting is to turn the <strong class="screenText">Pen pressure</strong> input on, under the <strong class="screenText">Blend with sub color</strong> slider, with a value of <strong class="screenText">50</strong> for <strong class="screenText">Change brush tip color</strong>. This way, I can enjoy having a sub-color appear naturally when I apply pressure to the brush, gradually increasing it while drawing. This gives you great control while merging two different colors. The following example shows a brush using my favorite settings, with red as the main color and white as the sub-color:</p>
<p class="normal">This category provides you with endless experiments in terms of brush stroke colors! Let’s now <a id="_idIndexMarker221"/>move on to<a id="_idIndexMarker222"/> more interesting settings that maximize the benefit of using digital art tools.</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_04_4.10.png"/></p>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.10: Brush example</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-79">Anti-aliasing</h2>
<p class="normal">The next category<a id="_idIndexMarker223"/> that we will look<a id="_idIndexMarker224"/> at in this chapter is the <strong class="screenText">Anti-aliasing</strong> category, which controls the appearance of smoothness on the border of brush strokes. The options appear as follows:</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_04_4.11.png"/></p>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.11: The Anti-aliasing category</p>
<p class="normal">Anti-aliasing is a fancy way to describe how jagged or smooth a digital line looks. Using the icons in the <strong class="screenText">Anti-aliasing</strong> category, the smoothing of a line can be set to <strong class="screenText">None</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Weak</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Middle</strong>, or <strong class="screenText">Strong</strong>. The following are two examples of lines made with the <strong class="screenText">G-pen</strong>. The top one has anti-aliasing set to <strong class="screenText">None</strong>, while the bottom one is set to <strong class="screenText">Strong</strong>:</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_04_4.12.png"/></p>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.12: The Anti-aliasing category</p>
<p class="normal">Notice how the top line has lots of sharp edges that make it look like it’s pixelated. Anti-aliasing adds tones of gray to the edge of a line to smooth it out, avoiding this jagged look. The bottom line, with the option set to <strong class="screenText">Strong</strong>, looks soft and almost blurry<a id="_idIndexMarker225"/> because of the <a id="_idIndexMarker226"/>amount of gray added around the edges. I generally select <strong class="screenText">Middle</strong> or <strong class="screenText">Strong</strong> unless I want to have a pixelated texture in my art.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-80">Dual brush</h2>
<p class="normal">Let’s have a look at <a id="_idIndexMarker227"/>the Dual brush <a id="_idIndexMarker228"/>settings under the category <strong class="screenText">2 – Brush shape</strong>. You can combine two different brush shapes to express unique brush strokes. Start by clicking the <strong class="screenText">Dual brush</strong> tick box, and then you will see all <strong class="screenText">Dual brush</strong> options appear. The setting is the same as the normal brush settings; there are shape, tip, effect, stroke, and texture options. There are millions of possibilities for inventing your own combinations.</p>
<p class="normal">In the following image, you can see some sample drawings of a grass-shaped brush, created using some Dual brush effects:</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_04_4.13.png"/></p>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.13: Sample Dual brush drawings</p>
<p class="normal">You can recreate <a id="_idIndexMarker229"/>the sample drawings by <a id="_idIndexMarker230"/>following these steps:</p>
<p class="normal">Download or create the Grass decoration brush, store it in Decoration brush Sub Palette, and select it. You can learn how to download brushes in <em class="italic">Chapter 18</em>, <em class="italic">Exploring the Clip Studio Assets and Animation</em>, or how to create it in <em class="italic">Chapter 9</em>, <em class="italic">Inking Special Effects and Material Palette</em>.</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">In the preceding image, underneath the <strong class="screenText">2-Anti-alising</strong> setting, you can see the stroke samples of the second brushes. Select one of them and click <strong class="screenText">Apply brush shape</strong>.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Try it out on the canvas.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">By picking <a id="_idIndexMarker231"/>various-shaped <a id="_idIndexMarker232"/>secondary brushes and trying out the Dual brush settings, you might encounter fantastic unexpected results!</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-81">Watercolor edge</h2>
<p class="normal">Now, let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker233"/>jump into the <a id="_idIndexMarker234"/>Watercolor edge category!</p>
<p class="normal">Traditionally, watercolor is an art material that uses water to thin the color and creates special textures, such as smudge, blur, stain, a transparent background color, and darker edges around the stained areas, which all create a very tender and crafted artistic effect. Clip Studio Paint has a function to recreate the effects digitally, as you can see in the art on the left:</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_04_4.14.png"/></p>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.14: Sample Watercolor brush drawing</p>
<p class="normal">With these watercolor effects in mind, let’s have a look at a list of <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool Detail</strong> categories under the <strong class="screenText">Watercolor edge</strong> settings. <strong class="screenText">Watercolor edge</strong> creates an edge on brush strokes when it’s active. Combine this with textures for a watercolor effect. This effect is not visible with dense color brushes. The following screenshot shows a watercolor edge brush stroke along with the <strong class="screenText">Watercolor edge</strong> settings:</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_04_4.15.png"/></p>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.15: Watercolor edge category with an example stroke</p>
<p class="normal">When you click on any option, a description of it will appear on the palette. The most important <a id="_idIndexMarker235"/>one is <strong class="screenText">Watercolor edge</strong>, which controls <a id="_idIndexMarker236"/>the strength of the edge appearance. By clicking the checkbox and changing its value, we will have a desirable edge appearance on the canvas!</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-82">Correction</h2>
<p class="normal">Now, let’s jump into<a id="_idIndexMarker237"/> the list of <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool Detail</strong> categories<a id="_idIndexMarker238"/> under the <strong class="screenText">Correction</strong> settings. <strong class="screenText">Correction</strong> settings can assist us in making clean, sharp lines in our drawings, even if we have shaky hands or aren’t used to doing digital art and inking yet. The trade-off for relying too heavily on some of these options, however, is that high settings on some of them can cause computer lag, depending on the specs of your system.</p>
<p class="normal">The following is a screenshot of the <strong class="screenText">Correction</strong> settings:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_04_4.16.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.16: Correction category</p>
<p class="normal">Here are <a id="_idIndexMarker239"/>each <a id="_idIndexMarker240"/>of the <strong class="screenText">Correction</strong> options explained:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Sharp angles</strong> automatically turns corners in drawn lines into sharp points, even if they are slightly curved.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Stabilization</strong> is used to smooth out your lines. The larger the value of the <strong class="screenText">Stabilization</strong> setting, the smoother the line will be (even if the line you actually draw is shaky). The <strong class="screenText">Adjust by speed</strong> checkbox will allow the stabilization level to adjust, depending on the moving speed of the brush. You can choose whether you want more stabilization when you move your brush more slowly or more quickly.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Post correction</strong> will stabilize the line and smooth it out once the line has been drawn. There is a slight lag between the line being drawn and the smoothing process. <strong class="screenText">Adjust by speed</strong> smooths the line more, depending on the speed at which the line is drawn. <strong class="screenText">Adjust by scale</strong> controls the amount of smoothing of the line, based on the zoom of the canvas. <strong class="screenText">Bezier curve</strong> converts the line to a quadratic Bezier curve once the correction is completed.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Taper</strong> automatically tapers the end of lines, depending on the value set. The larger the value, the more tapered the end of the line will get after the brush mark is made.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Enable snapping</strong> controls whether or not this tool will snap to an active ruler. We’ll be learning all about rulers in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 13</em>, <em class="italic">All about Rulers</em>.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Vector magnet</strong> is used on vector layers. It allows the new line to merge automatically with existing vector lines. More information about vectors will be presented in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 10</em>, <em class="italic">Exploring</em> <em class="italic">Vector Layers.</em></li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Using <strong class="screenText">Stabilization</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Post Correction</strong> can make a huge difference in your inking. It’s great if <a id="_idIndexMarker241"/>you’re just starting <a id="_idIndexMarker242"/>to work digitally or your hands aren’t very steady. It’s OK to have shaky lines for a sketching stage, but you need steady lines for inking, especially background buildings or metal objects. In the following screenshot, the line above is before <strong class="screenText">Post Correction</strong>, and the line below is the same one after being corrected:</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_04_4.17.png"/></p>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.17: Line drawings</p>
<p class="normal">Notice how much smoother the line below is when compared to the one above, especially around the curves. However, sometimes, this computer correction can make lines look less organic, so depending on your personal art style, you may want to use it sparingly if you want to have an organic and crafty style of artwork. If your style blends well to super-smooth curves, such as when you’re drawing<a id="_idIndexMarker243"/> loads of futuristic buildings<a id="_idIndexMarker244"/> and robots, then go crazy!</p>
<div><p class="normal"> <strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">In the section that follows, <em class="italic">Playing with brush settings</em>, we’re going to learn how to copy a tool and make changes to the copy. I like to ink my figures with a very organic-looking brush tool, but I also have a copy of that tool with the stabilization set high to ink robotic objects and inorganic backgrounds. Saving copies of your favorite tools can help save time, so give it a try!</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">The following image shows a sample artwork that uses the same G-pens, but one uses light stabilization to draw organic shapes, such as flowers and stones, and another uses heavy post-correction to draw the straight lines of bamboo and wooden objects:</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_04_4.18.png"/></p>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.18: Sample art using correction settings</p>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Correction</strong> tool is<a id="_idIndexMarker245"/> like having an <a id="_idIndexMarker246"/>invisible assist as you draw!</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-83">Starting and ending</h2>
<p class="normal">Let’s now take<a id="_idIndexMarker247"/> a look at <a id="_idIndexMarker248"/>the <strong class="screenText">Starting and ending</strong> category. These options alter how the beginning and end of a drawn line appear. If you are struggling to get a perfectly tapered line, these settings will help you to achieve the look you desire, as shown in the following samples:</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_04_4.19.png"/></p>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.19: Sample strokes with Starting and ending off and on</p>
<p class="normal">The image on the left shows samples of pen strokes with and without the <strong class="screenText">Starting</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Ending</strong> options.</p>
<p class="normal">The strokes above are<a id="_idIndexMarker249"/> great for drawing 1980s-style simple drawing patterns or handwriting. The strokes below were made with <strong class="screenText">Starting and ending</strong> turned on, with the <strong class="screenText">Brush size</strong> using a <strong class="screenText">Starting</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Ending</strong> value of <strong class="screenText">800</strong> each. Read on to how to adjust it!</p>
<p class="normal">The following is a screenshot of the <strong class="screenText">Starting and ending</strong> settings screen:<img alt="" src="img/B22275_04_4.20.png"/></p>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.20: Starting and ending category</p>
<p class="normal">The very first option <a id="_idIndexMarker250"/>beneath <a id="_idIndexMarker251"/>this category is a drop-down menu with options to change the beginning and end of lines. Each of the items listed is a factor that the start and end of the line can be modified by. Checking the box next to the desired parameter activates it, and the slider to the right is then used to set the minimum value of that setting, but normally, we use the <strong class="screenText">Brush size</strong> option only, with the value set to 1 in the drop-down menu.</p>
<p class="normal">The following options are also present in the <strong class="screenText">Starting and ending</strong> settings:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">How to specify</strong> allows the <strong class="screenText">Starting and ending</strong> settings to be set by <strong class="screenText">Length</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Percentage</strong>, or <strong class="screenText">Fade</strong>. <strong class="screenText">Length</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Percentage</strong> will produce lines that go from the set minimum value to the full value and then back again, depending on the length of the drawn line. Selecting <strong class="screenText">Fade</strong> will only change the ending of the line and not the beginning.</li>
<li class="bulletList">The <strong class="screenText">Starting</strong> checkbox and slider allow us to configure the length of the effect at the start of the line. The <strong class="screenText">Ending</strong> checkbox and slider do the same thing, except at the end of the line!</li>

<p class="normal">The next brush <a id="_idIndexMarker252"/>option <a id="_idIndexMarker253"/>is the final one.</p>
<h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-84">Anti-overflow</h3>
<p class="normal">The last brush<a id="_idIndexMarker254"/> category is <strong class="screenText">Anti-overflow</strong>. It comes <a id="_idIndexMarker255"/>in handy when we are adding color to images. We need to set a line art layer as a “reference layer” first to stop brushstrokes from going beyond the lines. You can do this by selecting the line art layer and clicking the <strong class="screenText">Set selected layer as a reference layer</strong> icon, which looks like a lighthouse image on the layer palette.</p>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Anti-overflow</strong> settings appear as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_04_4.21.png"/></p>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.21: Anti-overflow settings</p>
<p class="normal">These are<a id="_idIndexMarker256"/> amazingly useful when you color your<a id="_idIndexMarker257"/> art. The following sample shows some artwork with <strong class="screenText">Do not cross lines of reference layer</strong> off on the left top and on on the bottom. The detailed settings on the right side are 10% for <strong class="screenText">Tolerance</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Area scaling</strong> ticked with a 1.00 value, and <strong class="screenText">Rectangle Scaling mode</strong>:</p>

<p class="normal">As you can see on the below of the image, the color doesn’t overflow from the line art as you start adding the color. We don’t need to tediously erase any overlapping color afterward!</p>

</div>
<p class="normal">There are many, many possibilities in terms of fiddling around with brush settings, and <a id="_idIndexMarker258"/>mastering these options <a id="_idIndexMarker259"/>really helps when trying out new expressions and customizing a brush for your own needs. Let’s read on to try out different settings!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-85">Playing with brush settings</h1>
<p class="normal">Now, we have an <a id="_idIndexMarker260"/>idea of what these brush settings do. One of the best things about digital art is that almost nothing is permanent. If you make a mark with a pen, you can almost always undo it (or erase it). With Clip Studio Paint, if you make a change to a tool that you don’t like, you can always revert the tool to its initial settings. That said, let’s learn how to make a copy of an existing brush tool, make changes to the copy, and then make marks with the copy to see what some of the brush options do when utilized.</p>
<p class="normal">Follow these steps to create a copy of a brush tool and change the settings:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Select the tool to be copied. For these instructions, we are going to use the <strong class="screenText">G-pen sub tool</strong> tool.</li>
<li class="numberedList">In the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> palette, as shown in the following screenshot, click on the icon that is pointed by arrow. This is the <strong class="screenText">Duplicate sub tool</strong> icon:</li>
</ol>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.23: The Sub Tool palette</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="3">In the pop-up <strong class="screenText">Duplicate sub tool</strong> window that appears, as shown in the following screenshot, enter a name for the new sub tool. I’ve left the name as <strong class="screenText">G-pen 2</strong> for this example:
    <p class="center"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_04_4.24.png"/></p>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.24: The Duplicate sub tool window</p></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="4">Make sure<a id="_idIndexMarker261"/> that a canvas is open in the canvas window so that the new tool can be tested as changes are made.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Open the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool Detail</strong> window. Make sure that you can see and draw on the canvas behind the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool Detail</strong> window. We are going to use this blank canvas to test our changes.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Continue changing the settings and testing the new brush on the canvas to see the effects.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Once you’ve finished changing the settings and seeing what they do in practice, you can either click on the <strong class="screenText">X</strong> in the upper right-hand corner of the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool Detail</strong> window to close it and save the tool as it is, or you can reset the tool to its initial settings.</li>
<li class="numberedList">To reset the tool to its initial settings, press the <strong class="screenText">Reset all settings to default </strong>button in the lower-left corner of the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool Detail</strong> window.</li>
<li class="numberedList">To save the settings as the new default (and overwrite the current default settings of the tool), press the button marked <strong class="screenText">Register all settings to initial settings</strong> in the lower right-hand corner of the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool Detail</strong> window.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">Now that we’ve copied a brush tool, made changes, and experimented with the settings, let’s learn<a id="_idIndexMarker262"/> how to save a backup copy of our new brush tool and how to load a brush into the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> palette. Read on for more details.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-86">Exporting and loading brushes</h1>
<p class="normal">Whether you simply<a id="_idIndexMarker263"/> want to have a backup copy of all your custom<a id="_idIndexMarker264"/> tools if a catastrophe should happen, or you want to share your brushes with the world by giving them away or selling them, knowing how to export your tools is a great thing. It’s an extremely simple process that can save you hard work in the future or provide an income stream if you’re particularly good at making specialty brushes! But before we get into making specialty brushes in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 9</em>, <em class="italic">Inking Special Effects and Material Palette,</em> let’s learn how to export and load brushes to make backup copies of our tools. You can export and import any type of sub tool in Clip Studio Paint, not just brushes!</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-87">Exporting a tool</h2>
<p class="normal">Now, let’s look <a id="_idIndexMarker265"/>at how to export your tool. By following these easy steps, you will save a backup copy of the tool you created originally on your device. You don’t have to worry if you modify your tool; the original is always there, in a folder on your device!</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Select a sub tool to export. For this example, we will use the <strong class="screenText">G-pen 2</strong> tool that we created in the previous section.</li>
<li class="numberedList">In the upper left-hand corner of the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> palette is an icon of three horizontal lines. This is the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> drop-down menu. Clicking on the menu will display it, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.25: A part of the Sub Tool group menu</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="3">Click on<a id="_idIndexMarker266"/> the <strong class="screenText">Export sub tool...</strong> option in the menu.</li>
<li class="numberedList">In the next screen, navigate to a folder where you wish to save the sub tool. Then, enter the name of the tool. In the following screenshot, we leave the name as <strong class="screenText">G-pen 2</strong>:</li>
</ol>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.26: The Sub tool saving window</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="4">Click <strong class="screenText">Save</strong> to complete the export.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">Now, let’s learn <a id="_idIndexMarker267"/>how to load a tool into Clip Studio Paint.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-88">Importing a tool</h2>
<p class="normal">Now that we’ve<a id="_idIndexMarker268"/> exported our custom tool, let’s learn how to import a tool. You can find and download new tools from digital art supplier websites such as True Grid Texture Supply (<a href="https://www.truegrittexturesupply.com/">https://www.truegrittexturesupply.com/</a>). There are free and priced tools available for download. You can find more information by joining Clip Studio forums on SNS, or simply following digital art tip accounts. </p>
<p class="normal">Once you have some tools to import to your Clip Studio Paint tool palette, you can actually do so in two ways, and we’ll cover both of them here!</p>
<p class="normal">The following are the steps to use the <strong class="screenText">Import sub tool…</strong> option method of importing a tool:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Click on the <strong class="screenText">Pen</strong> category in the toolbar and then the <strong class="screenText">Pen</strong> category in the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> palette, where the tool is to be exported.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> drop-down icon, which looks like three horizontal lines, in the upper left-hand corner of the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> palette. Then, click on the <strong class="screenText">Import sub tool...</strong> option.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Navigate to the folder where the sub tool file is located. Click on the file of the sub tool, and then click on the <strong class="screenText">Open</strong> button to complete the import.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">The following is the click and drag method to import a tool, which can also be used to import <a id="_idIndexMarker269"/>multiple tools simultaneously:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Either in your operating system in Windows or <strong class="screenText">Finder</strong> on Mac, open the folder containing the tools to be imported.</li>
<li class="numberedList">In Clip Studio Paint, choose the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> palette category that the tool or tools will be stored in.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click and drag the window with the folder where the tool files are located so that Clip Studio Paint’s <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> palette can be seen at the same time as the folder. This is shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_04_4.27.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.27: The Sub tool category and the Finder window</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="4">Select the tool or tools to be imported. Click and drag the tool or tool files over the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> palette. The mouse cursor will turn into a <em class="italic">+</em> symbol. Release the mouse button to complete the import.</li>
<li class="numberedList">The import of the tool or tools will then be completed. In the following screenshot, we can see that <strong class="screenText">G-pen 2</strong> has been added to the <strong class="screenText">Pen</strong> Sub Tool<a id="_idIndexMarker270"/> group:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_04_4.28.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.28: The Sub Tool category</p>
<p class="normal">Done! You have exported and imported sub tools. Isn’t it great to know how to customize and move tool files? Now, you’re able to create tools on your own and organize them! It’s like having real brushes and tool cabinets to store them in at a traditional artist’s<a id="_idIndexMarker271"/> studio!</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Important Note</strong></p>
<p class="normal">From version 1.10.6 onward, Clip Studio Paint can import Photoshop brush files (<code class="inlineCode">.abr</code>). You can import them by using the same method discussed in this section! The brush results may differ from their usage in Photoshop, but it’s great to know that we can share brushes!</p>

<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-89">Summary</h1>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we learned how to navigate the brush categories and sub tools. We also learned how to customize our brushes using some of the options in Clip Studio Paint’s brush engine. Then, we learned how to export our tools to make backups or share them with others, as well as two ways to import new tools into our software.</p>
<p class="normal">Now that we’ve learned about brushes, in the next chapter, we are going to take a look at the program’s preferences. They are very helpful to create a comfortable art studio to work in, by decluttering and placing frequently used tools closer to you. Let’s build a unique environment for your creation! We will also look at page and panel creations. Read on to learn more.</p>
