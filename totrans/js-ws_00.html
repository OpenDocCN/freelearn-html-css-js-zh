			<h2 id="_idParaDest-3"><a id="_idTextAnchor003"/>About the Chapters</h2>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em>, <em class="italic">Getting to Know JavaScript</em>, introduces a foundational background of JavaScript in order to move forward and achieve competency. This chapter introduces you to JavaScript, through its history through to modern implementations, with additional information on various uses of the language to provide a proper context for what comes next.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em>, <em class="italic">Working with JavaScript</em>, covers some hands-on work with the language. We'll provide an overview of some popular tools for writing JavaScript and the various available runtimes for executing their code. We'll pay particular attention to the primary target for most JavaScript and a great tool in itself, the modern web browser.<em class="italic"> </em></p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em>, <em class="italic">Programming Fundamentals</em>, serves as an introduction to the fundamental concepts and structures involved when working in JavaScript and programming in general. We'll cover all the basics, from object types to conditionals and looping structures, how to go about writing and invoking functions, and even commenting and debugging their code.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em>, <em class="italic">JavaScript Libraries and Frameworks</em>, focuses on plain-old vanilla JavaScript, along with various frameworks and libraries that exist today. The primary focus of this chapter is to provide an understanding that while extensions to the core language can be great, sometimes, core JavaScript is really all you need. </p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 5,</em> <em class="italic">Beyond the Fundamentals</em>, explains that data is represented differently in different languages and runtimes. JavaScript is based on the ECMAScript specification and has definitive rules for how data is represented. This chapter discusses data in JavaScript, how to convert between types, and how types are passed around within a script.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="italic">Understanding Core Concepts</em>, utilizes an HTML page using JavaScript in this book, as well as being the first to explain the abstract nature of the event messaging system. Understanding these concepts is very valuable when building a useful web application in JavaScript. Throughout this chapter, you will explore the various nuances of event message bubbling and capturing, along with how it can best be used to control the flow of information within an application. You will also see how to halt these events in their tracks and to create your own custom events. This chapter will give you a foundational arsenal at your disposal to tackle applications of any size or complexity. </p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em>, <em class="italic">Popping the Hood</em>, clarifies how the thing many people think of as 'just JavaScript' can actually be broken down into separate components: the JavaScript engine, consisting of the call stack, memory heap, and the garbage collector; and the JavaScript runtime environment, such as a browser, or Node.js, which contains the JavaScript engine, and gives the engine access to additional functions and interfaces, such as <strong class="source-inline">setTimeout()</strong> or a filesystem interface. We will also look at how JavaScript manages memory allocation and deallocation, and how even though it is managed automatically, it's important for developers to bear in mind the processes involved, in order to write code that enables the garbage collector to work correctly.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em>, <em class="italic">Browser APIs</em>, introduces a few of the most useful and interesting browser APIs that open up wide-ranging functionality that we can make use of in our JavaScript application. We'll see that while these APIs are most commonly accessed through JavaScript, they are not a part of the ECMAScript specification to which the JavaScript engines are programmed and are not part of JavaScript core functionality. </p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em>, <em class="italic">Working with Node.js</em>, guides us in unifying the entire web application development around a single programming language, as opposed to learning different languages and building different projects for server-side and client-side. In this chapter, you will go through how the node is working in the background and how it is processing requests asynchronously. Furthermore, you will study different types of modules and how to use them. You will also do a lot of important exercises to gain practical exposure. </p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em>, <em class="italic">Accessing External Resources</em>, explores the fact that web pages are static and of limited use without fresh data. This chapter covers various approaches to using Ajax to obtain data, primarily from RESTful services.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em>, <em class="italic">Creating Clean and Maintainable Code</em>, introduces you to best practices for clean and maintainable coding. You will learn that refactored code that uses clean coding techniques results in code that is much longer than before. But you will see that the code is much cleaner and easier to understand and test compared to the original. The value of this programming style really shows itself more in complex real-world applications, and it is good practice to work this way. Developers and tech leads need to decide what standards and clean coding practices make sense for their particular project.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em>, <em class="italic">Using Next-Generation JavaScript</em>, looks at the various tools available in the market for advanced development in JavaScript. We will learn how to use the latest JavaScript syntax in older browsers and identify the different options for the development of JavaScript applications in other languages. We will also explore various package managers, such as npm and Yarn, that are compatible with JavaScript, along with several different frameworks, such as AngularJS, React, and Vue.js. Finally, we will look at some server-side libraries, such as Express, Request, and Socket.IO.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em>, <em class="italic">JavaScript Programming Paradigms</em>, teaches you that JavaScript is a multi-paradigm programming language. We can use it to write code in procedural, object-oriented, and functional design patterns. During the learning phase of any programming language, people usually code in a procedural way where, instead of planning, they put most of their focus on the execution and understanding the concepts of that particular programming language. But when it comes to practical execution in real life, the <strong class="bold">object-oriented programming</strong> paradigm, or <strong class="bold">OOP,</strong> is a scalable option. </p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em>, <em class="italic">Understanding Functional Programming</em>, discusses how functional programming is quite different from other programming paradigms such as imperative and object-oriented approaches, and it takes some getting used to. But, properly applied, it is a very powerful way of structuring programs to be more declarative, correct, and testable with fewer errors. Even if you don't use pure functional programming in your projects, there are many useful techniques that can be used on their own. This is especially true for the <strong class="source-inline">map</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">reduce</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">filter</strong> array methods, which can have many applications. The topics covered in this chapter will help you bolster the skills you need to pursue a programming project in the functional style.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Chapter 15</em>, <em class="italic">Asynchronous Tasks</em>, discusses how asynchronous tasks allow the execution of the main thread of a program to proceed even while waiting for data, an event, or the result of another process, and achieve snappier UIs and some forms of multitasking. Recent enhancements to the language, such as promises and the <strong class="source-inline">async</strong>/<strong class="source-inline">await</strong> keywords, simplify such development and make it easier to write clean and maintainable asynchronous code.</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.3: Installing the extension</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>Downloading Node.js</h2>
			<p>Node.js is open source and you can download it from its official website <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">https://nodejs.org/en/download/</a> for all platforms. It supports all three major platforms: Windows, Linux, and macOS.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/>Windows</h3>
			<p>Visit their official website and download the latest stable .MSI installer. The process is very simple. Just execute the <strong class="source-inline">.MSI</strong> file and follow the instructions to install it on the system. There will be some prompts about accepting license agreements. You have to accept those and then click on <strong class="source-inline">Finish</strong>. That's it.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-10"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"/>Mac</h3>
			<p>You have to download the .pkg file from the official website and execute it. Then, follow the instructions. You may have to accept the license agreement. After that, follow the prompts to finish the installation process.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-11"><a id="_idTextAnchor011"/>Linux</h3>
			<p>In order to install Node.js on Linux, execute the following commands as root in the same order they are mentioned:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">$ cd /tmp</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">$ wget http://nodejs.org/dist/v8.11.2/node-v8.11.2-linux-x64.tar.gz</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">$ tar xvfz node-v8.11.2-linux-x64.tar.gz</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">$ mkdir -p /usr/local/nodejs</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="source-inline">$ mv node-v8.11.2-linux-x64./* /usr/local/nodejs</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Here, you first change the current active directory to the temporary directory (<strong class="source-inline">tmp</strong>) of the system. Second, you download the <strong class="source-inline">tar</strong> package of the <strong class="source-inline">node</strong> from their official distribution directory. Third, you extract the <strong class="source-inline">tar</strong> package to the <strong class="source-inline">tmp</strong> directory. This directory contains all the compiled and executable files. Fourth, you create a directory in the system for <strong class="source-inline">Node.js</strong>. In the last command, you are moving all the complied and executable files of the package to that directory.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-12"><a id="_idTextAnchor012"/>Verifying the Installation</h3>
			<p>After the installation process, you can verify whether it is installed properly in the system by executing the following command in the directory of Node.js: </p>
			<p class="source-code">$ node -v &amp;&amp; npm -v</p>
			<p>It will output the current installed version of Node.js and npm:</p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer011">
					<img alt="Figure 0.3: Installed version of Node.js and npm&#13;&#10;" src="image/C14377_0_04.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 0.4: Installed version of Node.js and npm</p>
			<p>Here, it is showing that the 8.11.2 version of Node.js is installed on the system, as is the 5.6.0 version of npm.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-13"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"/>Installing the Code Bundle</h2>
			<p>Download the code and relevant files from GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/PacktWorkshops/The-JavaScript-Workshop">https://github.com/PacktWorkshops/The-JavaScript-Workshop</a> and place them in a new folder called <strong class="source-inline">C:\Code</strong> on your local system.
