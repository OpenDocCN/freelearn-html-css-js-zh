                    <h1 class="header-title">Introduction to Client-Side Scripting</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="mce-root">In this chapter, we will start taking a look at client-side basics. This will give you an idea of where and how to write your client-side scripts and how to test them. We'll also take a look at a few examples for getting started in this area.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will be looking at these topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client scripts</li>
<li>UI policies</li>
<li>How and when to write client-side scripts</li>
<li>Testing a client-side script</li>
<li>Basic client-side script examples</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Client scripts</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Client scripts are generally the client-side scripts most used by developers. By default, a client script will run on all views of a form, but it can be set up to only run for a certain view by unchecking the global checkbox and entering a specific view into the view field that appears. Client scripts can also be inherited to tables that extend from a different table. For example, a client script on the task table can be inherited to tables that extend it, like the incident, change, and problem tables. To allow tables to inherit a client script, the inherit checkbox must be set.</p>
<p>The script in a client script can be run at different times, depending on when the developer chooses. This choice is made by selecting a type for the client script.</p>
<p>There are four types of client script, and these are:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>onLoad</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>onChange</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>onSubmit</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>onCellEdit</kbd></li>
</ul>
<p>Let's take a look at each type and when you may want to use each to achieve your scripting goals.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">onLoad</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The <kbd>onLoad</kbd> client script type runs script when a form is loaded. This can be helpful to manipulate data on a form before a user starts using it. Sometimes, when a form loads slowly, it is possible to see <kbd>onLoad</kbd> client scripts doing their job.</p>
<p>When selecting the <kbd>onLoad</kbd> type, the script field will be populated with the <kbd>onLoad</kbd> function ServiceNow provides for you, as long as the script field hasn't already been edited. The script looks as follows:</p>
<pre>function onLoad() {<br/>    //Type appropriate comment here, and begin script below<br/><br/>}</pre>
<p>This is the <kbd>onLoad</kbd> function to put your script into. Any script running <kbd>onLoad</kbd> will take time to run and slow down loading time, so it is always worth trying to keep <kbd>onLoad</kbd> client scripts to a minimum, and short, if necessary. I have been involved in projects simply to reduce the amount of <kbd>onLoad</kbd> client scripts on forms to reduce load times.</p>
<p>Try to have only one <kbd>onLoad</kbd> client script for each table, rather than multiple. This makes it easy to maintain, as all <kbd>onLoad</kbd> code is in one place, and you can be completely confident of the order the <kbd>onLoad</kbd> code will run in.</p>
<p>In the following figure, <em>Figure 3.1</em>, we can see what this type of client script will look like:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-518 image-border" src="img/00b13751-09d5-4a3d-97e3-e3e59f390140.png" style="width:100.92em;height:57.92em;"/></div>
<p>Figure 3.1: Sample onLoad client script</p>
<p>In the preceding figure, we can see an <kbd>onLoad</kbd> client script ready to be written for the incident table. As the comment states in the code, replace the comment in the code with the functionality of your script, and then begin writing underneath the comment inside the <kbd>onLoad</kbd> function.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">onChange</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The <kbd>onChange</kbd> client script runs when a selected field is changed on the form. It is important to note that an <kbd>onChange</kbd> script will also run when the form is loaded. This type of script is often used to auto-populate other fields on a form, based on data in the field the <kbd>onChange</kbd> script is running on. For example, if a user is selected on a form, other user data on the form, like company and job title, could be populated using an <kbd>onChange</kbd> script.</p>
<p>In the same way that ServiceNow provides a script function in <kbd>onLoad</kbd> scripts, an <kbd>onChange</kbd> function is also provided. This is slightly more complicated, so let's take a look:</p>
<pre>function onChange(control, oldValue, newValue, isLoading, isTemplate) {<br/>    if (isLoading || newValue === '') {<br/>        return;<br/>    }<br/><br/>    //Type appropriate comment here, and begin script below<br/><br/>}</pre>
<p>The <kbd>onChange</kbd> function gives us five parameters that we can use inside the function in our script. Here is what each of these parameters gives us:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>control</kbd>: The dynamic HTML of the field that has changed</li>
<li><kbd>oldValue</kbd>: The value in the changed field when the form was loaded</li>
<li><kbd>newValue</kbd>: The new value that has been entered into the changed field</li>
<li><kbd>isLoading</kbd>: Is true if the form is loading; otherwise, false</li>
<li><kbd>isTemplate</kbd>: Is true if the change has occurred as part of a template load; otherwise, false</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also see that a little scripting has already been done by ServiceNow. This <kbd>if</kbd> statement checks if the form is loading or if the new value of the changed field is empty. If either of these cases is true, the script returns from the function, essentially canceling the script. In most cases, this is quite helpful, but it is good to understand this <kbd>if</kbd> statement, as sometimes you will want to amend it if you want code to run during loading or on the field changing to an empty value.</p>
<p>For example, if you have cleared a user field where additional user data has been added to the form, you will also want to clear the additional user data. In this instance, you will want to remove the condition where the code returns from the function if the <kbd>newValue</kbd> parameter is blank.</p>
<p>When selecting the <kbd>onChange</kbd> type, the option to pick a field for the script to run against will be visible to the developer. The fields available in this field are dependent on the value in the table field.</p>
<p>We can see an <kbd>onChange</kbd> type client script in <em>Figure 3.2</em>:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-519 image-border" src="img/b86eb6b9-402a-46d0-b03a-8c7d9b14f846.png" style="width:100.58em;height:57.83em;"/></div>
<p>Figure 3.2: Sample onChange client script</p>
<p>In the preceding figure, we can see an <kbd>onChange</kbd> client script for the problem table. Pay particular attention to the Field name field, which defaults to Active, as that is the field that needs to change for this script to run. It can be easy to forget to change this field and wonder why your script is not executing when you are expecting it to.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">onSubmit</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The <kbd>onSubmit</kbd> client script type runs when a form is saved. This type of script is not that widely used, as we can often use server-side script to perform actions for us once a record is saved, but it can be helpful, as it provides a final chance to execute client-side script before server-side script is run.</p>
<p>The script ServiceNow provides for <kbd>onSubmit</kbd> is quite similar to <kbd>onLoad</kbd>:</p>
<pre>function onSubmit() {<br/>    //Type appropriate comment here, and begin script below<br/><br/>}</pre>
<p>The <kbd>onSubmit</kbd> script type can be used to check field values before a save takes place and abort the save if invalid values exist in fields. </p>
<p>When considering writing an <kbd>onSubmit</kbd> script, it is worth thinking about whether that script could run on the server side instead. This is because the client script runs in front of the user, and further processing must wait until the script finishes, whereas on the server side, the code is executed away from the user and can be executed alongside other scripts.</p>
<p>If you want to abort the form being submitted, return false from the <kbd>onSubmit</kbd> function.</p>
<p>We can see an <kbd>onSubmit</kbd> example in <em>Figure 3.3</em>:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-520 image-border" src="img/ffc38ca1-9fe5-4abc-a1ff-f2e5527c3c3d.png" style="width:104.67em;height:57.67em;"/></div>
<p>Figure 3.3: Sample onSubmit client script</p>
<p>For our <kbd>onSubmit</kbd> client script example, we can see that this client script is ready for the script to be added for the change table.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">onCellEdit</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="mce-root">The <kbd>onCellEdit</kbd> type of client script runs when a cell is edited on the list view of a table. This is the only client script type that does not run on the form view of a table. This type of client script is helpful to ensure that the rules you want to stick to are also enforced on list views of a table.</p>
<p>The script that ServiceNow provides for <kbd>onCellEdit</kbd> scripts looks a little different from the other client script types:</p>
<pre>function onCellEdit(sysIDs, table, oldValues, newValue, callback) {<br/>  var saveAndClose = true;<br/> //Type appropriate comment here, and begin script below<br/><br/> callback(saveAndClose);<br/>}</pre>
<p>It is worth noting that these scripts could be for multiple records, as you can edit more than one using a list. As you can see, there are quite a few different parameters in this slightly different type of script. We'll have a look at what each one of those parameters gives us:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>sysIDs</kbd>: All of the <kbd>sys_id</kbd> unique IDs of the records being edited in an array.</li>
<li><kbd>table</kbd>: The current table of the records being edited.</li>
<li><kbd>oldValues</kbd>: The old values of all the cells being edited.</li>
<li><kbd>newValue</kbd>: The new value to be put into all the cells being edited.</li>
<li><kbd>callback</kbd>: A callback that allows the execution of further <kbd>onCellEdit</kbd> scripts or commits the change made if no further scripts exist. A <kbd>true</kbd> or <kbd>false</kbd> parameter can be passed, which will either allow further scripts and commit changes, or stop execution of further scripts and not commit the change, respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>These scripts tend to not be used that frequently, as server-side scripts like business rules can often be used to perform the functionality needed. Editing records in the list can also be a powerful tool for updating multiple records at once, so this is sometimes locked down to only certain users to prevent less knowledgeable users from causing issues.</p>
<p>An <kbd>onCellEdit</kbd> client script example can be viewed in <em>Figure 3.4</em>:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-521 image-border" src="img/d0ea13db-6ec0-4f6d-9ea7-fc6e160ecc5c.png" style="width:105.42em;height:57.83em;"/></div>
<p>Figure 3.4: Sample onCellEdit client script</p>
<p>The client script in the preceding figure is an <kbd>onCellEdit</kbd> for the requested item table.  Again, for this type of script, ensure the Field name field is set to the value you require, as the script will only run on a change to this field in the list view.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">UI policies</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>UI policies are a more configurable version of client scripts. An administrator sets a condition and then uses actions or scripts to amend fields. Using configuration, a developer can change whether a field is mandatory, visible, and read-only. If these are the changes you are considering making to a field, a UI policy is usually the best option. UI policies are easier to understand and maintain for other administrators than client scripts.</p>
<p>UI policies can also be scripted based on the condition set, as in, you can run code if the condition matches and you can run code if the condition does not match. Setting the condition in a UI policy is much like setting a condition elsewhere in ServiceNow, as it uses the standard condition builder.</p>
<p>UI policies run against a table, but because you can use the condition builder, a number of fields can be used as part of the condition built. UI policies come with some tick boxes that dictate when the UI policy should be applied. In the following, we'll take a look at the different choices and how they change when a policy is applied:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>Global</kbd>: Set by default, this means the UI policy will run on all views by default, although by unticking the global tick box, you can select a specific view.</li>
<li><kbd>On load</kbd>: Set by default, too, this tick box, when checked, runs the policy when the form is loaded, as well as when fields are changed.</li>
<li><kbd>Reverse if false</kbd>: If the condition is not true, then reverse the effects of the UI policy. This is set by default.</li>
<li><kbd>Inherit</kbd>: Unset by default, this allows tables that extend the selected table to inherit the policy. For example, a policy on the task table would be inherited by the incident table if this was set.</li>
</ul>
<p>A UI policy has UI policy actions associated to it that will take effect when the condition matches, or in reverse if the reverse if false checkbox is set. These actions allow for fields to be made mandatory, visible, read-only, or a combination of these effects. UI policy actions are considered as configurations, and considered best practice when taking these actions on fields.</p>
<p>If you want to achieve more with a UI policy, there are options to script on matching or not matching the given condition. This is rarely used, as client scripts tend to fit this requirement better, but let's look at how it works.</p>
<p>Firstly, to script in a UI policy, you must set the Run scripts checkbox. This makes two fields appear: Execute if true and Execute if false. These are fairly self explanatory in that they will run if the condition defined in the UI policy matches true or false.</p>
<p>ServiceNow gives us the function to put our code into, which looks as follows:</p>
<pre>function onCondition() {<br/><br/>} </pre>
<p>This function is the same in both the Execute if true or Execute if false script fields.</p>
<p>UI policies are very useful for making fields mandatory, visible, and read-only. The ability to configure rather than customize is certainly considered best practice if thinking of scripting in UI policies, though it is often best to use a client script. This is because you only have to maintain one script with a client script, rather than the two on a UI policy. It is also easier to code for all eventualities in client scripts, rather than just matching or not matching a set condition, as in UI policies.</p>
<p>We can see a UI policy in <em>Figure 3.5</em> showing the script form section:</p>
<div><img src="img/4a84cb9f-139b-4169-b123-7bc876b2a5db.png"/></div>
<p>Figure 3.5: Sample UI policy showing script fields</p>
<p>In the preceding figure, we can see a UI policy currently set to run on the incident table. It is important, if we use the two script fields we can see, that we cover the scenarios of the condition of the UI policy being true and false with these two scripts.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How and when to write client-side scripts</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Client-side scripts should be written when a developer wants to change the screen in front of the user. This could be a change to a field value, visibility, or another change. Every time client-side scripts are run, it requires resources from the instance, and so keeping client-side scripting to a minimum is important.</p>
<p>If you can make a change on the server side rather than the client side, then is it considered best practice to do so. This will then keep loading times shorter and improve the user experience.</p>
<p>Let's have a look at some common uses for client-side scripting and how best to achieve these tasks.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Making fields mandatory, visible, or read-only</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>For making fields mandatory, visible, or read-only, it is best to use a UI policy. This method uses configuration rather than customization, and is easier to maintain.</p>
<p>Scripting does not need to be done in this case, as you can use UI policy actions to achieve your goal. ServiceNow makes these actions easy to set up with the condition builder.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Populating fields based on the value of another field</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Another popular use for client-side scripting is populating a field based on the value of another. A common use of this is when selecting a user in a field and then wanting, for example, to automatically populate the company, telephone number, and job title.</p>
<p>For this example, you will want to use an <kbd>onChange</kbd> client script. By setting the <kbd>onChange</kbd> field to be the user field, you can then get the rest of the user data using a client script. The best practice for this is to use a <kbd>GlideAjax</kbd> call, which we will explore in advanced client scripting later in the next chapter.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Showing/hiding form sections</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Sometimes you will want to show only certain form sections to different types of users. This can be based on a number of variables, but often it will be based on the roles a user has or the groups they belong to.</p>
<p>For this requirement, an <kbd>onLoad</kbd> client script can be used. This will ensure that before the form is available to the user, the required form sections can be hidden.  </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Review</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>We have looked at some of the more common uses of client scripting, but this is by no means an exhaustive list. When considering writing scripts on the client side, it is often worth thinking about how necessary they are and if they can be better placed in server-side script. Remember that client-side scripts increase load times, so try to keep them to a minimum. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Testing client-side scripts</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Testing scripts in ServiceNow can be done in a few ways. Fortunately, client-side scripts can be some of the easiest to test, because the script is running in front of the user, and therefore, logging and feedback on scripts can be shown directly to the user, too.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Alert</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>One of the simplest ways to debug client script is to use the alert functionality. <kbd>alert</kbd> simply pops up a message window displaying information you choose to include. This can be useful for showing the values of fields or variables at certain times, or simply to confirm that certain functions were entered.</p>
<p>Let's see how <kbd>alert</kbd> works in the following code:</p>
<pre>alert('Debug Message');</pre>
<p>The preceding script will simply show a pop-up message to the user saying <kbd>Debug Message</kbd>. It is a simple line of code to write and provides instant feedback.</p>
<p>Let's have a look at how we can use <kbd>alert</kbd> to help us test our code:</p>
<pre>function onLoad() {<br/>alert('Start of script');<br/>var shortDescBefore = g_form.getValue('short_description');<br/>alert('The short description beforehand is ' + shortDescBefore);<br/>g_form.setValue('short_description', 'Alerting Issue');<br/>var shortDescAfter = g_form.getValue('short_description');<br/>alert('The short description afterwards is ' + shortDescAfter);<br/><br/>}</pre>
<p>In the preceding example, we are using three messages to test that the script is working how we would like it to. The first will simply alert us to the script starting by showing the user Start of script. This can be helpful to check that JavaScript is running correctly on a browser or that other client scripts are not causing an error that stops this script from running.</p>
<p>The second message gives us the value of the short description as the form is loading. We are storing the value of the short description in the <kbd>shortDescBefore</kbd> variable and using it in our alert. We can combine strings of text and variables together in an alert by using the plus sign between them.</p>
<p>The third message shows the value of the short description field after we have used the <kbd>g_form setValue</kbd> method to amend it. The third message will read The short description afterwards is Alerting Issue.</p>
<p>Using <kbd>alert</kbd> allows us to test and also debug script that has been written quickly and effectively. The problem with using <kbd>alert</kbd> is that you must ensure all alerts are removed or commented out if being used for tests or debugging. This is due to them being very obvious to users if they are not removed, and some do find them rather irritating to have to keep clicking away.</p>
<p>I tend to like testing in this way for initial development because of how easy it is to use. However, alert does not provide an ongoing testing method, so it can be better to put in a cleaner logging method for maintenance of your code.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Jslog</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Another way of testing and debugging client-side scripts is using <kbd>jslog</kbd>. When using <kbd>jslog</kbd>, you can write lines in scripts to send logs to the JavaScript log. The JavaScript log can be opened in the developer system settings so that messages can be viewed. This method will only show logs to users who have the JavaScript log open, so it can be a less intrusive method of testing scripts.</p>
<p>The contents of a <kbd>jslog</kbd> message can be the same as a message using <kbd>alert</kbd>. Let's have a look at how we write this in script:</p>
<pre>jslog('Testing Message');</pre>
<p>In the preceding example, the message <kbd>Testing Message</kbd> will appear in the JavaScript log. Jslog can contain strings or variables, but it will not display in the ServiceNow logs. It only appears in the JavaScript log, so you must ensure you have it open if using this testing method.</p>
<p>As the JavaScript log will not be open for regular users, it is possible to leave these logs in for future maintenance of scripts. If you choose to do this, make sure that the logs you leave in are well documented and minimal. It is difficult for a new developer to maintain an instance they are new to, where the JavaScript log is constantly being updated. </p>

<p>The browser method is not a ServiceNow-specific way of debugging client-side scripts, but can be a useful one. Because these scripts are running on the client, web browsers often have ways of displaying running JavaScript code that you can check.</p>
<p>These methods vary based on the browser you use to view ServiceNow, but most modern browsers will have some way of checking what JavaScript is running which can be used to test your client-side scripts.</p>
<p>I personally tend to like using Google Chrome for browser-based testing, but other browsers can be just as good.</p>

<p>Having introduced the basic elements of client-side scripting and how and where to use it, we can take a look at some examples of scripts to further our understanding.</p>
<p>We'll start by looking at some client script examples.</p>
<p>In this first example, we'll use an <kbd>onLoad</kbd> client script to show and hide form sections based on the logged-in users' roles. We'll only show the related records form section on the incident form if the logged-in user has the <kbd>itil_admin</kbd> role:</p>
<pre>function onLoad() {<br/>    if (g_user.hasRole('itil_admin')) {<br/>        g_form.setSectionDisplay('related_records', false);<br/>    }<br/>}</pre>
<p>As you can see in the example, we are using <kbd>g_user</kbd>'s <kbd>hasRole</kbd> method to determine whether the logged-in user has the required role. If they don't, then we use the <kbd>g_form</kbd> <kbd>setSectionDisplay</kbd> method to hide the form section. Putting this client script as an <kbd>onLoad</kbd> type allows us to ensure that this form section is immediately hidden from the user.</p>
<p>I have often used this type of script before to hide sensitive data that appears on a form section. This can range from financial details to personal information held by HR.</p>
<p>We can see how this script would look in <em>Figure 3.6</em>:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-522 image-border" src="img/c8e14742-3215-4865-b112-76d2a4f33c26.png" style="width:104.42em;height:57.67em;"/></div>
<p>Figure 3.6: OnLoad client script to hide form sections</p>
<p class="mce-root">Now let's have a look at an <kbd>onChange</kbd> client script example. Sometimes, we may want to increase the speed at which incidents for certain categories are looked into. Let's suppose that for this example, we want to set the urgency to high for all network incidents, medium for database ones, and low for all other users.</p>
<p>We need to make sure we set the <kbd>Field name</kbd> field value to <kbd>Category</kbd> for our <kbd>onChange</kbd> script. Let's look at the code we need:</p>
<pre>function onChange(control, oldValue, newValue, isLoading, isTemplate) {<br/>    if (isLoading || newValue === '') {<br/>        return;<br/>    }<br/><br/>    switch(newValue) {<br/>        case 'network':<br/>            g_form.setValue('urgency', 1);<br/>            break;<br/>        case 'database':<br/>            g_form.setValue('urgency', 2);<br/>            break;<br/>        default:<br/>            g_form.setValue('urgency', 3);<br/>    }<br/><br/>}</pre>
<p>In this example, we have used a <kbd>switch case</kbd> statement to perform different actions, based on the new value of the field. This JavaScript technique is more efficient than using multiple <kbd>if</kbd> statements. We have also used the <kbd>newValue</kbd> parameter that ServiceNow gives us to quickly decide on which value we should set the urgency to. </p>
<p>When setting the value of the urgency in this example, the user is still able to amend the urgency field if they feel the urgency is not fitting for this particular incident. It is possible to lock down fields though which have been populated by scripts by making them read-only or setting security rules.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at how this client script looks in <em>Figure 3.7</em>:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-523 image-border" src="img/65a27981-0d38-4371-b87e-c6dbef6d6e7a.png" style="width:42.50em;height:29.67em;"/></div>
<p>Figure 3.7: OnChange client script setting urgency based on category</p>
<p>Next, we'll have a look at an example using an <kbd>onSubmit</kbd> type client script. These are less used than some of the other types of client script, but it is good to see how to create one if necessary.</p>
<p>In this example, we'll look at making sure a user has filled in the description if they have the <kbd>itil</kbd> role. Sometimes you may want to ensure that users with more technical experience fill in further information on a form:</p>
<pre>function onSubmit() {<br/>    if (g_user.hasRole('itil') &amp;&amp; g_form.getValue('description') == '') {<br/>        g_form.addErrorMessage('Enter a description to save.');<br/>        return false;<br/>    }<br/><br/>}</pre>
<p>In the preceding example, we use the <kbd>g_form.addErrorMessage</kbd> method to show a message at the top of the form if a user with the <kbd>itil</kbd> role tries to save the form with no description. This message will let the user know why they are not able to save the form. The code that stops the record from being saved is returning false from the <kbd>onSubmit</kbd> function. If at any point in the <kbd>onSubmit</kbd> script the function returns false, then the record will not be saved.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Being able to stop a form from being saved is an important aspect of the <kbd>onSubmit</kbd> type of client script, and arguably, its main use.</p>
<p>The example we have scripted can be seen in <em>Figure 3.8</em>:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-524 image-border" src="img/6c2d7897-382e-42b6-aea2-e442bbe6c698.png" style="width:104.75em;height:57.83em;"/></div>
<p>Figure 3.8: OnSubmit client script enforcing description update for itil users</p>
<p>Now let's see an example using the <kbd>onCellEdit</kbd> type of client script. Often, these types of script are used to validate the input that a user enters into a cell on the list view.</p>
<p>For this example, we will ensure that a user does not enter a high impact into a cell to force them to open up the form view to do this:</p>
<pre>function onCellEdit(sysIDs, table, oldValues, newValue, callback) {<br/>  var saveAndClose = true;<br/>  if (newValue == 1) {<br/>    alert('High Impact cannot be set on a list view.');<br/>    saveAndClose = false;<br/>  }<br/>  <br/>  callback(saveAndClose);<br/>}</pre>
<p>This example uses the <kbd>newValue</kbd> parameter to check the value the impact has been set to. If it has <kbd>high</kbd> or <kbd>1</kbd> as the value of the field, which we need to use in scripts rather than labels, then the user is alerted through a message. By setting the <kbd>saveAndClose</kbd> variable to <kbd>false</kbd>, we can also stop the field from being updated. This is because the callback is using this variable, and therefore also sets the <kbd>callback</kbd> to <kbd>false</kbd>.</p>
<p>Often, business rules can be used to fulfill a similar task to the <kbd>onCellEdit</kbd> scripts, but it is useful to see how they can be created.</p>
<p>We can also see how this script looks in ServiceNow in <em>Figure 3.9</em>:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-525 image-border" src="img/73411a06-408f-4b56-8b79-cdd72a8e423d.png" style="width:104.92em;height:57.67em;"/></div>
<p>Figure 3.9: OnCellEdit client script stopping impact being set to high on list views</p>
<p class="mce-root">These examples give us a good understanding of the different types of client script, and some uses for each. Now we'll take a look at UI policies.</p>
<p>As a UI policy is configured, we mainly only need to use script if we want to run scripts for the Execute if true and Execute if false fields we described earlier in the chapter.</p>
<p>For this example, we will change the short description when the UI policy condition matches and clear the value again if the condition does not match. Firstly, let's see the Execute if true script:</p>
<pre>function onCondition() {<br/>  g_form.setValue('short_description', 'Matched condition');<br/>}</pre>
<p>As the condition handles when we want the script to run, we simply need to perform the actions we want to take in the Execute if true script. This script will change the value in the short description field.</p>
<p>Now let's see the Execute if false script:</p>
<pre>function onCondition() {<br/>  g_form.setValue('short_description', '');<br/>}</pre>
<p>This second script will clear the Short description field if the condition does not match. In this example, the short description field would only ever contain no value or the <kbd>Matched condition</kbd> text. When writing scripts in UI policies, think carefully about all of the outcomes of your script. Writing scripts in these two separate scripts can be more difficult, which is why scripting is usually done in client scripts rather than UI policies.</p>
<p>We can see the UI policy containing the scripts we created in <em>Figure 3.10</em>:</p>

<p class="mce-root">During this chapter, we looked at basic uses of client-side scripting in client scripts and UI policies. We explored the four different types of client script and saw how each script type works. We also discovered how and when to write client-side scripts and how to test and debug them. Finally, we looked at some practical examples of client-side scripts and where uses of the different types of client script can be utilized.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we continue with client-side scripting, looking at the more advanced techniques and areas where client-side scripts can be used. We take a look at script actions, AJAX calls for calling server-side scripts, and using UI actions to run client-side scripts.</p>
