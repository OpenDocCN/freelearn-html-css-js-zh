- en: '**JavaScript Fatigue** was a trendy term back in 2016, a time when new libraries
    and frameworks emerged on a daily basis. This promoted diversity, but also crippled
    developers with too many options. Even today, developers are expected to have
    experience working with **build tools**, **linters**, **testing frameworks**,
    **assertion libraries**, **package managers**, **module loaders**, **module bundlers**,
    **routers**, **web servers**, **compilers**, **transpilers**, **static typecheckers**, **virtual
    DOM** libraries, **state management** tools, **CSS preprocessors** and **UI Frameworks** (I''ve
    probably missed a few).'

- en: No wonder people find it difficult to get started, or even keep up, with JavaScript. Many
    have spent days learning a dozen different tools just to set up their project.
    And that's before they write a single line of code!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nonetheless, this boom in diversity does bring tangible benefits—it pulls us
    away from opinionated frameworks and allows us to tailor our application as a
    composite of many smaller modules. Therefore, instead of bemoaning the state of
    the ecosystem, we should spend the time to learn each tool.

- en: Whilst most programming books today examine a single framework, library, or
    language in great detail, this book provides you with a solid foundation on a
    wide range of tools and practices commonly used in enterprise environments. Each
    of them contributes to building a reliable, production-ready application. In other
    words, we focus on *breadth* over *depth*.
  prefs: []

- en: We also value structure over chaos; as such, there's a heavy emphasis on establishing
    **best practices**, following **processes**, **testing**, **infrastructure**,
    and **automation**. If these words whet your appetite, then this book is perfect
    for you.

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Traditionally, most tech companies followed a horizontal structure, where development,
    testing, and operations are separated into different departments. Since they are
    interdependent, every team can only work at the pace of the slowest team.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In recent years, however, we have seen a shift towards **vertical** **teams**. Vertical
    teams are formed based on project requirements, where each team is responsible
    for all stages of the process—from gathering requirements to deployment. This
    allows teams to take *full* ownership of the entire feature, as they become self-reliant
    and can move at their own pace. Consequently, many companies require their developers
    to command a broad skillset.

    to learn new tools, but for all developers who wish to stay relevant in today's
