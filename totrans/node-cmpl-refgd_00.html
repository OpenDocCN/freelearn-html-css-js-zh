<p class="mce-root">Machine learning is becoming more and more transformational to businesses every passing day. Machine Learning with Node.js Complete Reference Guide takes you through rudimentary knowledge of JavaScript and server-side development to create, maintain, deploy, and test your own Node.js applications.</p>
<p class="mce-root">You will begin by learning how to use the HTTP Server and Client objects, store data with both SQL and MongoDB databases, and unit test applications with Mocha 5.x, and functionally test them with Puppeteer 1.1.x. Then, you will learn to create scalable and rich RESTful applications on the Node.js platform and write a simple HTTP request handler with self-descriptive URLs. You will learn to set accurate HTTP status codes, study how to keep your applications backward-compatible and explore some authentication techniques to secure your application. Then, you will study how Node.js has emerged as a strong candidate for developing microservices.</p>
<p class="mce-root">With this Learning Path, you will be able to use the best practices and create efficient microservices.</p>
<p class="mce-root">This Learning Path includes content from the following Packt products:</p>
<ul>
<li class="mce-root">RESTful Web API Design with Node.js 10, Third Edition by Valentin Bojinov</li>
<li class="mce-root">Node.js Web Development, Fourth Edition by David Herron</li>
<li class="mce-root">Hands-On Microservices with Node.js by Diogo Resende</li>

<p>The execution of the code examples provided in this <span>Learning Path</span> requires Node.js running on POSIX-like operating systems, various UNIX derivatives (Solaris, for example) or workalikes (Linux, macOS, and so on), as well as on Microsoft Windows. It can<br/>
run on machines both large and small, including the tiny ARM devices such as the Raspberry Pi microscale embeddable computer for DIY software/hardware projects.</p>
<p>Because many Node.js packages are written in C or C++, you must have a C compiler (such as GCC), Python 2.7 (or later), and the node-gyp package. If you plan to use encryption in your networking code, you will also need the OpenSSL cryptographic library. The modern UNIX derivatives almost certainly come with these, and Node.js's configure script, used when installing from source, will detect their presence. If you need to install them, Python is available at <a href="http://python.org">http://python.org</a> and OpenSSL is available at <a href="http://openssl.org">http://openssl.org</a><a href="http://openssl.org">.</a></p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "The <kbd>EventEmitter</kbd> object is defined in the events module of Node.js."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>if (anotherNote instanceof Note) {<br/> ... it's a Note, so act on it as a Note<br/>}</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>$ npm update express<br/>$ npm update</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "If you need something different, click on the <strong>DOWNLOADS</strong> link in the header for all possible downloads:</span> <span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
