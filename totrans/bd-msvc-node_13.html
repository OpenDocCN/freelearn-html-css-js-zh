			<h1 id="_idParaDest-241"><a id="_idTextAnchor242"/>Monitoring Microservices in Node.js</h1>
			<p>When working with microservices architecture and Node.js, you need to monitor microservices in Node.js.</p>
			<p>We’ll start this chapter by understanding the principles of monitoring microservices. Monitoring microservices in a Node.js environment is crucial for ensuring the health, performance, and reliability of the system. Also, it is an ongoing process that requires continuous refinement and adaptation to changing requirements. By employing a comprehensive monitoring strategy, teams can proactively identify and address issues, optimize performance, and ensure the overall reliability and security of the microservices architecture.</p>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you will have learned how to constantly monitor microservices in Node.js.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we’re going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Structured logging and log levels</li>
				<li>Contextual information and centralized log management</li>
				<li>Application-level metrics, distributed tracing, and health checks</li>
				<li>Threshold-based alerts and anomaly detection</li>
				<li>Request tracing, request context propagation, and logging frameworks</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In the first section, we’re going to show how to monitor with structured logging and understand log levels.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-242"><a id="_idTextAnchor243"/>Structured logging and log levels</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Structured logging</strong> involves organizing log messages<a id="_idIndexMarker1050"/> in a predefined format, typically as key-value pairs or JSON objects, making them more machine-readable and enabling easier analysis. <strong class="bold">Log levels</strong> indicate the severity or importance of a log<a id="_idIndexMarker1051"/> message.</p>
			<p>Here are some best practices<a id="_idIndexMarker1052"/> for structured logging:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>service_name</code>, and custom fields.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Contextual information</strong>: Include relevant context information in logs, such as user IDs, transaction IDs, and service-specific identifiers. Facilitate correlation between logs from different microservices.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Error information</strong>: For error logs, include details such as error <a id="_idIndexMarker1053"/>codes, stack traces, and additional diagnostic information. This aids in <strong class="bold">root cause analysis</strong> (<strong class="bold">RCA</strong>) and debugging.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Correlation IDs</strong>: Use correlation IDs to trace requests across microservices. Include the correlation ID in each log entry related to a specific request.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Structured log libraries</strong>: Leverage structured logging libraries such as Winston or Bunyan in Node.js. Customize log formatters to produce structured output.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In microservices architectures, structured logging is especially valuable for correlating logs across services and providing context-rich information.</p>
			<p>Structured logging is a method of creating log records that have a consistent and well-defined format, making them easier to search and analyze. Some best practices for structured logging are the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Use a standard format, such as JSON, for your<a id="_idIndexMarker1054"/> log records. This will make them machine-readable and compatible with various log management tools.</li>
				<li>Include relevant fields or key-value pairs in your log records, such as timestamp, log level, message, source, context, and any custom data. This will help you filter, query, and correlate your logs more efficiently.</li>
				<li>Avoid logging sensitive or personal information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or usernames. This will prevent security breaches and comply with data protection regulations.</li>
				<li>Use consistent naming and formatting conventions for your fields and values. This will make your logs more readable and avoid confusion.</li>
				<li>Use appropriate log levels to indicate the severity and importance of your log events. This will help you prioritize<a id="_idIndexMarker1055"/> and troubleshoot your issues more effectively.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Here is what’s included<a id="_idIndexMarker1056"/> in log levels:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>DEBUG</code>:<ul><li><em class="italic">Purpose</em>: Detailed information useful for debugging.</li><li><em class="italic">Usage</em>: Debugging information, variable values, and other detailed insights.</li></ul></li>
				<li><code>INFO</code>:<ul><li><em class="italic">Purpose</em>: General information about system events.</li><li><em class="italic">Usage</em>: Startup messages, configuration details, and routine system events.</li></ul></li>
				<li><code>WARN</code> (<strong class="bold">Warning</strong>):<ul><li><em class="italic">Purpose</em>: Indicate potential issues that may not be critical.</li><li><em class="italic">Usage</em>: Non-fatal issues or conditions that may require attention.</li></ul></li>
				<li><code>ERROR</code>:<ul><li><em class="italic">Purpose</em>: Indicate critical errors that need attention.</li><li><em class="italic">Usage</em>: Errors that impact the normal functioning of the system.</li></ul></li>
				<li><code>FATAL</code>/<code>CRITICAL</code>:<ul><li><em class="italic">Purpose</em>: Indicate severe errors that lead to a service or application shutdown.</li><li><em class="italic">Usage</em>: Critical errors where the system cannot recover.</li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Microservices commonly use various log levels to categorize messages based on their significance.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Figure 13</em><em class="italic">.1</em> illustrates<a id="_idIndexMarker1057"/> structured logging:</p>

			<p>In summary, by adopting structured logging and carefully managing log levels, microservices environments can achieve better observability, faster troubleshooting, and improved overall system reliability. Consistency and attention to detail in log formats contribute to a more effective logging strategy.</p>
			<p>With an understanding of these concepts, let’s now move to contextual information and centralized log management.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-243"><a id="_idTextAnchor244"/>Contextual information and centralized log management</h1>
			<p>Contextual information in logs and centralized log management are essential components of effective observability and troubleshooting in microservices architectures.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-244"><a id="_idTextAnchor245"/>Contextual information in logs</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Contextual information</strong> in logs is very important in microservices<a id="_idIndexMarker1058"/> because it gives developers all the required information to better debug the application. Contextual information in logs includes any additional data that can help understand the context of a log event, such as the source, the time, the location, the parameters, the outcome, or the cause of the event. Contextual information can make logs more meaningful, useful, and actionable, as it can provide clues for troubleshooting, debugging, monitoring, or analyzing the behavior of an application or a system.</p>
			<p>Here’s why contextual<a id="_idIndexMarker1059"/> logging is important:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Traceability</strong>:<ul><li><em class="italic">What it does</em>: Helps trace the flow of a request or transaction through multiple microservices.</li><li><em class="italic">Implementation</em>: Using a unique identifier, such as a correlation ID, a trace ID, or a request ID, to tag each log event that belongs to the same transaction, operation, or workflow. This can help to group and filter log events that span multiple components or services and to reconstruct the execution path and the causal relationships of log events.</li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">User context</strong>:<ul><li><em class="italic">What it does</em>: Provides information about the user associated with a particular request.</li><li><em class="italic">Implementation</em>: Include user IDs or relevant user context information in logs.</li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Service identifier</strong>:<ul><li><em class="italic">What it does</em>: Identifies the specific microservice generating the log entry.</li><li><em class="italic">Implementation</em>: Include service names or IDs in each log entry.</li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Timestamp</strong>:<ul><li><em class="italic">What it does</em>: Indicates when an event occurred, aiding in chronological analysis.</li><li><em class="italic">Implementation</em>: Include timestamps with time zone information.</li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Error code</strong>:<ul><li><em class="italic">What it does</em>: Helps categorize and prioritize errors for easier debugging.</li><li><em class="italic">Implementation</em>: Include error codes or relevant status indicators.</li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Environment information</strong>:<ul><li><em class="italic">What it does</em>: Indicates the environment (e.g., development, production) in which the log was generated.</li><li><em class="italic">Implementation</em>: Include environment <a id="_idIndexMarker1060"/>indicators in logs.</li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Remember to give all necessary information in logs.</p>
			<p>With these concepts learned, we can continue with centralized log management.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-245"><a id="_idTextAnchor246"/>Centralized log management</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Centralized log management</strong> is also very important while developing<a id="_idIndexMarker1061"/> microservices because it can help developers save time and debug problems faster. Centralized log management is the process of collecting, storing, analyzing, and managing log data from various sources and systems in a single platform. Log data is the information generated by applications, devices, servers, networks, or any other components that record their activities, events, or changes.</p>
			<p>Here’s why it’s<a id="_idIndexMarker1062"/> important:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Single source of </strong><strong class="bold">truth (SSOT)</strong>:<ul><li><em class="italic">What it does</em>: Provides a single repository for storing, searching, and analyzing logs.</li><li><em class="italic">Implementation</em>: Utilize log aggregation tools or centralized logging services.</li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Efficient troubleshooting</strong>:<ul><li><em class="italic">What it does</em>: Facilitates faster issue identification and resolution through a consolidated view.</li><li><em class="italic">Implementation</em>: Use tools such as the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or cloud-based logging solutions.</li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Alerting </strong><strong class="bold">and monitoring</strong>:<ul><li><em class="italic">What it does</em>: Enables real-time monitoring and alerting based on log data.</li><li><em class="italic">Implementation</em>: Set up alerting rules and dashboards for log-based insights.</li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Security </strong><strong class="bold">and compliance</strong>:<ul><li><em class="italic">What it does</em>: Aids in security analysis and compliance audits.</li><li><em class="italic">Implementation</em>: Centralized storage simplifies the review of logs for security incidents.</li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In summary, by incorporating contextual information in logs and implementing centralized log management, microservices architectures can achieve better visibility, faster issue resolution, and improved collaboration across development and operations teams. These practices contribute to a more resilient and maintainable microservices ecosystem.</p>
			<p>Now, we can continue to the next section, in which we will talk about application-level metrics, distributed tracing, and health checks.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-246"><a id="_idTextAnchor247"/>Application-level metrics, distributed tracing, and health checks</h1>
			<p>Effective monitoring and observability in microservices involve gathering and analyzing various types of data. Application-level metrics, distributed tracing, and health checks play crucial roles in understanding the performance, dependencies, and overall health of microservices.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-247"><a id="_idTextAnchor248"/>Application-level metrics</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Application-level metrics</strong> are very important to profile logs better. Application-level<a id="_idIndexMarker1063"/> metrics are indicators that measure and monitor the performance, behavior, and quality of software applications. Application-level metrics can include aspects such as availability, response time, throughput, error rate, user satisfaction, resource utilization, and more. Application-level metrics can help developers, managers, and stakeholders understand how the application is functioning, identify and troubleshoot issues, optimize and improve the application, and ensure a good user experience.</p>
			<p>Here’s why they<a id="_idIndexMarker1064"/> are important:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Performance monitoring</strong>:<ul><li><em class="italic">What it does</em>: Provides insights into the performance of microservices.</li><li><em class="italic">Implementation</em>: Measure response times, throughput, and resource usage.</li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Resource utilization</strong>:<ul><li><em class="italic">What it does</em>: Helps identify resource bottlenecks and inefficiencies.</li><li><em class="italic">Implementation</em>: Monitor CPU usage, memory consumption, and disk I/O.</li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Error rate</strong>:<ul><li><em class="italic">What it does</em>: Indicates the frequency and nature of errors.</li><li><em class="italic">Implementation</em>: Track error rates and specific error types.</li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Throughput</strong>:<ul><li><em class="italic">What it does</em>: Measures the number of requests processed per unit of time.</li><li><em class="italic">Implementation</em>: Monitor request<a id="_idIndexMarker1065"/> or transaction throughput.</li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Understanding the metrics better will offer several benefits in microservices, and one of them is that developers can understand better how their code will run on the machines.</p>
			<p>We can continue now with distributed tracing.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-248"><a id="_idTextAnchor249"/>Distributed tracing</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Distributed tracing</strong> is important because it can identify all requests<a id="_idIndexMarker1066"/> being made by microservices and their dependencies and debug faster. Distributed tracing in logs is a technique that allows you to track and monitor the performance and behavior of requests that span multiple services, systems, or components in a distributed application. Distributed tracing in logs can help you to identify and troubleshoot issues, errors, or bottlenecks that occur along the request path and optimize and improve the user experience and system reliability.</p>
			<p>Here’s why distributed tracing<a id="_idIndexMarker1067"/> is important:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Request </strong><strong class="bold">flow visibility</strong>:<ul><li><em class="italic">What it does</em>: Traces requests as they move through various microservices.</li><li><em class="italic">Implementation</em>: Use trace IDs to correlate requests across services.</li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Latency analysis</strong>:<ul><li><em class="italic">What it does</em>: Helps identify latency bottlenecks in distributed architectures.</li><li><em class="italic">Implementation</em>: Measure the time taken by each microservice to process a request.</li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Dependency mapping</strong>:<ul><li><em class="italic">What it does</em>: Illustrates dependencies between microservices.</li><li><em class="italic">Implementation</em>: Visualize dependencies based on traced requests.</li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Be mindful of the overhead introduced by collecting metrics and traces, especially in high-throughput systems. We can continue now with health checks.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-249"><a id="_idTextAnchor250"/>Health checks</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Health checks</strong> can help developers and engineers keep<a id="_idIndexMarker1068"/> an automated eye on microservices and identify potential issues before they become a problem.</p>
			<p>Health checks are important<a id="_idIndexMarker1069"/> for the following reasons:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">System availability</strong>:<ul><li><em class="italic">What it does</em>: Ensures microservices are available and responsive.</li><li><em class="italic">Implementation</em>: Regularly check if microservices respond to health check requests.</li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Proactive </strong><strong class="bold">issue detection</strong>:<ul><li><em class="italic">What it does</em>: Identifies potential issues before they impact users.</li><li><em class="italic">Implementation</em>: Include checks for dependencies, database connections, and critical components.</li></ul></li>
				<li><code>/health</code>) for health check endpoints.</li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Integration can also include detailed information about the health of dependencies in health check responses.</p>
			<p>In summary, application-level metrics, distributed tracing, and health checks are integral components of a robust monitoring and observability strategy in microservices architectures. These practices provide valuable insights into the performance, dependencies, and health of individual microservices, contributing to a more resilient and efficient system.</p>
			<p>In the next section, we will learn about threshold-based alerts and anomaly detection.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-250"><a id="_idTextAnchor251"/>Threshold-based alerts and anomaly detection</h1>
			<p>Effective monitoring and alerting are critical components of a robust microservices architecture. Threshold-based alerts and anomaly detection mechanisms help identify issues, deviations from normal behavior, and potential problems before they impact the system’s performance.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-251"><a id="_idTextAnchor252"/>Threshold-based alerts</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Threshold-based alerts</strong> can help establish baseline metrics<a id="_idIndexMarker1070"/> to determine normal behavior. It can also allow for adjustable thresholds based on different environments (e.g., development and production).</p>
			<p>Here’s why threshold-based alerts<a id="_idIndexMarker1071"/> are important:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Proactive </strong><strong class="bold">issue detection</strong>:<ul><li><em class="italic">What it does</em>: Identifies abnormal conditions based on predefined thresholds.</li><li><em class="italic">Implementation</em>: Set thresholds for key metrics such as response times, error rates, and resource utilization.</li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Immediate notification</strong>:<ul><li><em class="italic">What it does</em>: Triggers alerts to notify stakeholders about issues in real time.</li><li><em class="italic">Implementation</em>: Use alerting systems to send notifications<a id="_idIndexMarker1072"/> via email, messaging platforms, or <strong class="bold">incident management</strong> (<strong class="bold">IM</strong>) tools.</li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>I can show you how alerting is done with <strong class="bold">Datadog</strong> and <strong class="bold">Splunk</strong>, two popular observability tools. Alerting<a id="_idIndexMarker1073"/> is a feature that<a id="_idIndexMarker1074"/> allows you to set up rules and conditions to notify you when something goes wrong or needs your attention in your systems or applications.</p>
			<p>With Datadog, you can create monitors that alert you about metrics, events, logs, integration availability, network endpoints, and more. You can configure the monitor type, query, alert threshold, notification<a id="_idIndexMarker1075"/> message, and recipients. You can also set up recovery notifications, anomaly detect<a id="_idTextAnchor253"/>ion, and alert grouping. You can view and manage your monitors from the <strong class="bold">Monitors</strong> page, where you can see their status, history, and configuration. You can also use the Datadog API to create, update, or delete monitors programmatically. For more details, you can check out the <a id="_idIndexMarker1076"/>Datadog documentation (<a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/">https://docs.datadoghq.com/</a>) on alerting.</p>
			<p>With Splunk, you can create alerts that trigger actions based on the results of a saved search. You can configure the alert type, schedule, trigger condition, throttle, and actions. You can also set up adaptive thresholding, predictive analytics, and alert dependencies. You can view and manage your alerts from the <strong class="bold">Alerts</strong> page, where you can see their status, history, and configuration. You can also use the Splunk REST API to create, update, or delete alerts programmatically. For more details, you can<a id="_idIndexMarker1077"/> check out the Splunk documentation (<a href="https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation">https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation</a>) on alerting.</p>
			<p>Both Datadog and Splunk offer integrations with various communication and collaboration tools, such as Slack, PagerDuty, Jira, and Microsoft <a id="_idIndexMarker1078"/>Teams, to send alert notifications and enable <strong class="bold">incident response</strong> (<strong class="bold">IR</strong>) workflows. You can also integrate Datadog and Splunk to<a id="_idIndexMarker1079"/> correlate metrics and logs across both platforms.</p>
			<p>Now, we can continue with anomaly detection.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-252"><a id="_idTextAnchor254"/>Anomaly detection</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Anomaly detection</strong> can help consider analyzing multiple<a id="_idIndexMarker1080"/> metrics together for a more comprehensive view and use historical data to train models and establish normal behavior.</p>
			<p>Anomaly detection is important <a id="_idIndexMarker1081"/>for the following reasons:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Identifying </strong><strong class="bold">unusual patterns</strong>:<ul><li><em class="italic">What it does</em>: Detects deviations from normal patterns or behaviors.</li><li><em class="italic">Implementation</em>: Utilize statistical methods or <strong class="bold">machine learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>) algorithms to identify<a id="_idIndexMarker1082"/> anomalies.</li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Adaptive monitoring</strong>:<ul><li><em class="italic">What it does</em>: Adapts to changes in system behavior over time.</li><li><em class="italic">Implementation</em>: Periodically retrain anomaly detection models to account for evolving patterns.</li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Advantages of anomaly detection in different sectors </strong><strong class="bold">of industry</strong>:<ul><li><em class="italic">Manufacturing</em>: Anomaly <a id="_idIndexMarker1083"/>detection can help detect faults or defects in machines, products, or processes and prevent costly breakdowns, scrap, or rework. For example, anomaly detection can monitor the sounds or vibrations of engines and alert the operators if there is any abnormality.</li><li><em class="italic">Finance</em>: Anomaly detection can help detect fraud or money laundering by analyzing transactions or spending patterns and flagging any suspicious activities. For example, anomaly detection can alert the bank if a customer withdraws a large amount of money from an unfamiliar location.</li><li><em class="italic">Healthcare</em>: Anomaly detection can help monitor patient health and detect any signs of diseases or complications by analyzing vital signs, lab results, or medical images and flagging any anomalies. For example, anomaly detection can alert the doctor if a patient has an irregular heartbeat or a tumor in an X-ray.</li><li><em class="italic">Cybersecurity</em>: Anomaly detection can help detect cyberattacks or intrusions by analyzing network traffic or system logs and flagging any malicious or unauthorized activities. For example, anomaly detection can alert the security team if a hacker tries to access a sensitive database or install malware.</li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Anomaly detection can incorporate<a id="_idIndexMarker1084"/> feedback from incident responses to continuously improve anomaly detection models.</p>
			<p>In summary, threshold-based alerts and anomaly detection are essential components of a proactive monitoring strategy in microservices architectures. They enable teams to identify and address issues promptly, contributing to improved system reliability and performance. By implementing these practices, organizations can enhance the resilience of their microservices ecosystem<a id="_idIndexMarker1085"/> and provide a better experience for users.</p>
			<p>Now, let’s move on to the next section on request tracing, request context propagation, and logging frameworks.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-253"><a id="_idTextAnchor255"/>Request tracing, request context propagation, and logging frameworks</h1>
			<p>In microservices architectures, managing and tracing requests as they traverse various services is crucial for understanding system behavior, identifying bottlenecks, and diagnosing issues. Combining request tracing, context propagation, and effective logging frameworks enhances observability and facilitates efficient debugging.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-254"><a id="_idTextAnchor256"/>Request tracing</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Request tracing</strong> can provide end-to-end visibility and performance<a id="_idIndexMarker1086"/> analysis. Request tracing in logs is a technique that lets you capture and analyze the details of a specific request processed by your application or system. Request tracing in logs can help you to diagnose and troubleshoot issues, errors, or performance problems that affect the request and to optimize and improve the user experience and system reliability.</p>
			<p>Here’s why request tracing<a id="_idIndexMarker1087"/> is important:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">End-to-end visibility</strong>:<ul><li><em class="italic">What it does</em>: Provides visibility into the entire life cycle of a request as it flows through different microservices.</li><li><em class="italic">Implementation</em>: Each microservice generates trace information with a unique identifier (trace ID) that is passed along with the request.</li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Performance analysis</strong>:<ul><li><em class="italic">What it does</em>: Helps analyze the performance of each microservice involved in processing a request.</li><li><em class="italic">Implementation</em>: Use <a id="_idIndexMarker1088"/>tools such as <strong class="bold">Zipkin</strong>, <strong class="bold">Jaeger</strong>, or <strong class="bold">OpenTelemetry</strong> to capture<a id="_idIndexMarker1089"/> and<a id="_idIndexMarker1090"/> visualize<a id="_idIndexMarker1091"/> traces.</li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In request tracing, it is a best practice to use correlation IDs (include a correlation ID in each request to correlate logs and traces across microservices) and sampling (implement sampling to avoid overwhelming the system with trace data in high-throughput scenarios).</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-255"><a id="_idTextAnchor257"/>Request context propagation</h2>
			<p>In <strong class="bold">request context propagation</strong>, it is important to be aware of context-aware processing and consistent logging. Request context propagation in logs is a technique that allows you to pass and access contextual information about a request, such as the source, the time, the path, the parameters, the outcome, or the error, across different components or services that process the request. Request context propagation in logs can help you to diagnose and troubleshoot issues, errors, or performance problems that affect the request and to optimize and improve the user experience and system reliability.</p>
			<p>Here’s why it’s<a id="_idIndexMarker1092"/> important:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Context-aware processing</strong>:<ul><li><em class="italic">What it does</em>: Enables microservices to be context-aware by passing contextual information along with requests.</li><li><em class="italic">Implementation</em>: Pass context information (e.g., user identity, transaction ID) between microservices.</li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Consistent logging</strong>:<ul><li><em class="italic">What it does</em>: Ensures consistency in logging by propagating context information.</li><li><em class="italic">Implementation</em>: Utilize context propagation mechanisms in frameworks such as Spring Cloud Sleuth or custom headers.</li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Request context propagation is important for distributed systems, especially microservices, because it allows you to track and monitor the performance and behavior of requests that span multiple components or services. Request context propagation can help you to do<a id="_idIndexMarker1093"/> the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Diagnose and troubleshoot issues, errors, or performance problems that affect the request and optimize and improve the user experience and system reliability.</li>
				<li>Enhance the security and compliance of the request by detecting and preventing threats, breaches, or violations.</li>
				<li>Analyze and report on the request’s metrics, trends, and insights.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As request context propagation can help you to diagnose and troubleshoot, enhance security and compliance, and analyze and report, we can also talk about its best practices.</p>
			<p>Some best practices<a id="_idIndexMarker1094"/> are the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Minimize overhead</strong>: Optimize context propagation mechanisms to minimize overhead, especially in high-throughput systems.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Context enrichment</strong>: Enrich context information as the request progresses through microservices to capture relevant details.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Request context propagation works by passing and accessing contextual information about a request, such as the source, the time, the path, the parameters, the outcome, or the error, across different components or services that process the request.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-256"><a id="_idTextAnchor258"/>Logging frameworks</h2>
			<p>In <strong class="bold">logging frameworks</strong>, you need to use best practices<a id="_idIndexMarker1095"/> for diagnosing information, auditing, and performance. Logging frameworks are libraries or modules that allow you to generate and format log data from your applications or systems. Log data is information that records the activities, events, or changes of your applications or systems. Logging frameworks can help you to diagnose and troubleshoot issues, errors, or performance problems and to optimize and improve the user experience and system reliability.</p>
			<p>Let us look at logging frameworks in more detail:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Diagnostic information</strong>:<ul><li><em class="italic">What it does</em>: Provides diagnostic information for troubleshooting and debugging.</li><li><em class="italic">Implementation</em>: Log relevant details such as input parameters, response codes, and critical events.</li></ul></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Auditing </strong><strong class="bold">and compliance</strong>:<ul><li><em class="italic">What it does</em>: Facilitates auditing and compliance by capturing significant events.</li><li><em class="italic">Implementation</em>: Log events that are crucial for compliance requirements.</li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Some best practices for logging frameworks are structured logging, log levels, and centralized logging, described<a id="_idIndexMarker1096"/> in the earlier sections of this chapter, specifically <em class="italic">Structured logging and log levels</em>, and <em class="italic">Contextual information and centralized </em><em class="italic">log management</em>.</p>
			<p>In summary, request tracing, context propagation, and effective logging are integral components of observability in microservices architectures. They provide insights into the flow of requests, enable context-aware processing, and facilitate efficient debugging and troubleshooting. By implementing these practices, organizations can achieve enhanced visibility, improved system reliability, and faster issue resolution in their microservices ecosystem.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-257"><a id="_idTextAnchor259"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we have learned a lot about microservices and how to monitor microservices in Node.js using several principles and tools.</p>
			<p>In summary, monitoring microservices in Node.js involves tracking and analyzing various aspects of the microservices to ensure their health and performance. This can include monitoring metrics such as response times, error rates, and resource usage.</p>
			<p>Various tools and practices can be used for monitoring microservices in Node.js, including the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Logging</strong>: Implementing comprehensive logging in Node.js microservices can provide valuable insight into their behavior and performance. Tools such as Winston or Bunyan can be used for structured logging.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Metrics collection</strong>: Using libraries such as Prometheus or StatsD to collect and expose metrics from the microservices, allowing for tracking of performance data over time.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Tracing</strong>: Implementing distributed tracing using tools such as OpenTracing or Jaeger can provide visibility into the flow of requests across microservices, helping to identify performance bottlenecks and errors.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Health checks</strong>: Implementing health checks within microservices to continuously monitor their availability and responsiveness.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Container orchestration platforms</strong>: Utilizing container orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes or Docker Swarm can provide built-in monitoring and metrics collection capabilities.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Application performance monitoring (APM) tools</strong>: Leveraging APM tools such as New Relic, Datadog, or AppDynamics to gain deeper insights into the performance of Node.js microservices.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By utilizing these tools and best practices, developers can ensure the reliability and scalability of their Node.js microservices. In the next chapter, we are going to learn about logging in microservices with Node.js.</p>
