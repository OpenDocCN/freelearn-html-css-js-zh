- en: SVG, an XML markup language, is designed to describe two-dimensional vector
    graphics. The SVG markup language resides in the DOM as a node that describes
    exactly how to draw a shape (a curve, line, circle, or polygon). Just like HTML,
    SVG tags can also be styled from standard CSS. Note that, because all commands
    reside in the DOM, the more shapes you have, the more nodes you have and the more
    work for the browser. This is important to remember because, as SVG visualizations
    become more complex, the less fluidly they will perform.
