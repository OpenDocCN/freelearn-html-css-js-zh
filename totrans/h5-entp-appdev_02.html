Fortunately, there are a plethora of tools available to support all facets of web application development. This chapter introduces a gamut of tools useful for web development, including editors, <strong>Integrated Development Environments</strong>
<a id="id47" class="indexterm"/> (<strong>IDEs</strong>), web servers, web browsers, browser tools, and even HTTP proxies in the market.</p><p>We will cover the following topics:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Choosing editors and IDEs</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Choosing web servers</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Prepackaged stacks</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Web browsers and add-ons</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">HTTP proxies</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec23"/>Choosing editors and IDEs</h1></div></div></div><a id="id48" class="indexterm"/><a id="id49" class="indexterm"/><p>The robustness of editors and integrated development environments varies widely and they are often built to address the various needs of the end user. They can range from very simple text editors such as Notepad (Windows) and TextEdit (Mac) to sophisticated IDEs such as Eclipse. To make things even more interesting, there is a variety of new web-based editors and IDEs that allow you to develop from virtually any machine and collaborate with others on web projects with minimal setup.</p><p>Selecting one will largely be based on your needs. If your needs are simple, your tools may be simple. If your needs are complex, your tools will be complex. Although you could use almost anything to write your code, we will herein cover tools that are specifically geared towards HTML5 development.</p><p>What follows is a brief discussion of the options available to you when developing your HTML5 enterprise applications. Of course, this is not meant to be an exhaustive list, as software updates will change the landscape considerably as time goes n.<a id="id50" class="indexterm"/>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec24"/>Choosing web servers</h1></div></div></div><a id="id84" class="indexterm"/><p>If you are managing your own web cluster or are developing on your local machine, it is helpful to know the web server packages available to you. It is especially helpful to install and run a web server on your machine to get a better understanding of how your HTML5 enterprise application will run without the overhead of uploading and syncing with a remote host. The following is a brief introduction to some of the most known web servers in the market.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec31"/>Apache</h2></div></div></div><a id="id85" class="indexterm"/><a id="id86" class="indexterm"/><p>One of the more widely used HTTP servers is Apache. It is an open source project going back to 1996 and it installs on both Unix and Windows operating systems.</p><p>Information on installing Apache web server can be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/install.html">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/install.html</a>.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec32"/>Apache Tomcat</h2></div></div></div><a id="id87" class="indexterm"/><p>Tomcat is an open source web server that provides a servlet container allowing you to run Java code.

It is known for its small footprint.</p><p>To use Jetty, you need to only use the Eclipse IDE (Aptana Studio 3, since it is derived from Eclipse, also comes with Jetty). Otherwise, you can find information on downloading and installing it at <a class="ulink" href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty/">http://wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty/</a>.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec34"/>Tornado</h2></div></div></div><a id="id90" class="indexterm"/><a id="id91" class="indexterm"/><p>Tornado is a relatively new open source web server, based on the server that powers FriendFeed (a real-time feed aggregator that consolidate updates from multiple social networks). It is particularly known for being fast and non-blocking and is, therefore, recommended for developing web services.</p><p>Information on Tornado can be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/">http://www.tornadoweb.org/</a>.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec35"/>nginx</h2></div></div></div><a id="id92" class="indexterm"/><a id="id93" class="indexterm"/><p>Pronounced "engine x", nginx started by running a number of Russian websites. Now it powers enterprises such as NetFlix and Hulu. Developed in 2002 by Igor Sysoev, it relies on an asynchronous architecture that allows it to scale quickly without impacting system resources.</p><p>Information on downloading and installing nginx can be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://nginx.org/en/download.html">http://nginx.org/en/download.html</a>.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec36"/>LightTPD</h2></div></div></div><a id="id94" class="indexterm"/><a id="id95" class="indexterm"/><p>Pronounced "lighty", LighTPD is an open source web server, designed and optimized for high performance environments. It is being used by sites such as YouTube, Wikipedia, and Meebo. It was developed by Jan Kneschke as a proof of concept to handle 10,000 connections in parallel on the same server (known as the c10k problem).</p><p>Information about download and install process can be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.lighttpd.net/">http://www.lighttpd.net/</a>.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec37"/>Node.js</h2></div></div></div><a id="id96" class="indexterm"/><a id="id97" class="indexterm"/><p>Although not technically a web server in and of itself, Node.js is a platform where you can write a simple web server. With the V8 JavaScript runtime developed for Google Chrome at its core, you can develop enterprise web applications with Node.js easily as the HTTP protocol is bundled into the platform. It is built with the same non-blocking principles used in Tornado and nginx, so it scales easier than other web servers and in some scenarios with little impact to system resources.</p><p>Additional information on Node.js can be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://nodejs.org/">http://nodejs.org/</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec25"/>Prepackaged stacks</h1></div></div></div><p>To make an environment setup even easier, there are a number of easy-to-install, prepackaged server stacks that have the web server, database, and scripting platform (typically PHP) built-in. You simply have to install the package and you have a complete sandbox environment ready to go. Some popular solutions include <a id="id98" class="indexterm"/>
<a id="id99" class="indexterm"/>MAMP (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.mamp.info/">http://www.mamp.info/</a>), which is built for Mac OS, WAMP<a id="id100" class="indexterm"/>

We will, however, take this a step further and cover some of the development add-ons available as well. With the richness of the tools either built into web browsers or pluggable, it is important to know what you have readily available to ensure that your HTML5 enterprise applications are optimal. The following is an introduction to the most common modern web browsers.<a id="id105" class="indexterm"/>
</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec38"/>Mozilla Firefox</h2></div></div></div><a id="id106" class="indexterm"/><a id="id107" class="indexterm"/><p>Until recent years Mozilla Firefox has been the most developer-friendly web browser by far; thanks to it many other web browsers have been including the most robust set of tools for developers. In fact, many web developers develop for Firefox first and then accommodate other browsers after. It comes with robust web developer tools built-in. Beyond that, however, you can augment it with add-ons that provide you with an even greater toolset for developing enterprise applications.</p><p>Firebug<a id="id108" class="indexterm"/>
<a id="id109" class="indexterm"/> (<a class="ulink" href="http://getfirebug.com/">http://getfirebug.com/</a>) allows you to inspect the rendered HTML markup, tweak CSS, and see it update automatically on the page, monitor and profile network activity, and debug JavaScript. In the following screenshot, you can see the Firebug HTML code inspector:</p><div><img src="img/5689_02_09.jpg" alt="Mozilla Firefox"/></div><p>Not only is it an extension, it is an add-on that can be itself extended. It boasts a number of extensions that add even more functionalities including FireCookie, FireUnit, FireQuery, and PageSpeed. Look here for a comprehensive list of Firebug extensions at <a class="ulink" href="http://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Firebug_Extensions">http://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Firebug_Extensions</a>.</p><a id="id110" class="indexterm"/><p>Another useful add-on is FireStorage<a id="id111" class="indexterm"/> and HTML5toggle<a id="id112" class="indexterm"/>. FireStorage allows you to view and manage Firefox's HTML5 local storage, while HTML5toggl<a id="id113" class="indexterm"/>e allows you to toggle HTML5 support on and off in order to test fallbacks.</p><div><img src="img/5689_02_11.jpg" alt="Mozilla Firefox"/></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note09"/>Note</h3><p>If you want to test new features before their final release, Mozilla provides channels to download pre-release and release versions of Firefox at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/">http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/</a>.</p><p>You can find three channels:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Firefox</strong>: This is the final release, tried and tested<a id="id114" class="indexterm"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Firefox Beta</strong>: This provides the latest features in a fairly stable environment</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Firefox Aurora</strong>: This channel is an experimental release with new features, but not so stable</li></ul></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec39"/>Google Chrome</h2></div></div></div><a id="id115" class="indexterm"/><a id="id116" class="indexterm"/><p>Google Chrome has, as of June 2012, become the most widely used web browser in the world, and it has done so with good reason. In addition to having a clean and simple user interface, it supports a library of extensions and add-ons, has a number of developer tools built-in, and it has its own task manager, which allows you to view and manage your memory and CPU usage. This is very useful for debugging enterprise applications and developing for optimal performance.</p><div><img src="img/5689_02_12.jpg" alt="Google Chrome"/></div><p>It comes with built-in developer tools. Just right-click on a web page and click on <strong>Inspect Element</strong>. Likewise, you can click on the <strong>View</strong> menu, then <strong>Developer</strong>, and then <strong>Developer Tools</strong>. This will open up a section at the bottom of the browser window, which has a number of tools at your disposal including a DOM and CSS editor, a view for HTML5 local storage, a JavaScript profiler, and even a performance auditor as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/5689_02_13.jpg" alt="Google Chrome"/></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note10"/>Note</h3><p>If you want to try new features before their final release, you can download Chrome versions through different release channels from the following link:</p><p>

You can also click on the <strong>Develop</strong> menu and click on <strong>Show Web Inspector</strong>. Safari's Web Inspector offers almost the same tools provided by Chrome's Developer Tools including a DOM editor (here called the <a id="id124" class="indexterm"/>
<strong>Snippet Editor</strong>), a profiler, and a view of local storage.</p><div><img src="img/5689_02_15.jpg" alt="Safari"/></div><a id="id125" class="indexterm"/><a id="id126" class="indexterm"/><p>Additionally, Safari can be augmented with extensions although the selection is not as robust as that of Firefox.

Internet Explorer 9 comes with developer tools to inspect the DOM and make basic edits. It also includes tools to validate markup as well as a profiler and HTTP sniffer. To view the developer tools, click on <strong>Tools</strong> and then <strong>F12 developer tools</strong>. The developer tools should appear at the bottom of the window, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/5689_02_16.jpg" alt="Internet Explorer"/></div><a id="id129" class="indexterm"/><a id="id130" class="indexterm"/><p>The developer tools also include two extra features: <strong>Browser Mode</strong> and <strong>Document Mode</strong>. The <strong>Browser Mode</strong>
<a id="id131" class="indexterm"/> feature allows you to select the version of Internet Explorer, while <strong>Document Mode</strong> allows you to select which rendering engine mode to use when rendering a page. The difference here is that <strong>Browser Mode</strong> sets the default <strong>Document Mode</strong> and how the web browser identifies itself to the server, while <strong>Document Mode</strong>
<a id="id132" class="indexterm"/> can be changed by a web page by setting the X-UA-Compatible <code class="literal">meta</code> tag; for example, to mimic the behavior of Internet Explorer 8 we can use the following tag:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">&lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=8"&gt;</pre></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec42"/>Opera</h2></div></div></div><a id="id133" class="indexterm"/><a id="id134" class="indexterm"/><p>Beginning as a research project in 1994, Opera was first released in 1996 with Version 2.0. Since then it has grown steadily in usage over the years although it has not seen the explosive growth of Google Chrome. Still, it is used widely in countries such as Ukraine and Belarus, and is considered one of the major web browsers in the market.</p><p>Opera uses its own rendering engine, called Vega, and its own JavaScript engine, called Carakan. It comes with its own developer tools, called Opera Dragonfly, as well. Dragonfly includes a DOM and CSS inspector as well as a JavaScript console and profiler. To view Dragonfly, right-click anywhere on a web page and click on <strong>Inspect Element</strong>, or click on <strong>View</strong>, then navigate to <strong>Developer Tools</strong> | <strong>Opera</strong>
<strong>Dragonfly</strong>

Although the use of HTTP proxies will be covered more in depth later when we talk about debugging, it is useful to familiarize yourself with these tools.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec43"/>Charles</h2></div></div></div><a id="id139" class="indexterm"/><a id="id140" class="indexterm"/><p>Charles is a widely used web proxy that has versions for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. It includes many useful features such as bandwidth throttling, where you can simulate lower bandwidth connections to see how your application performs with limited connectivity. It can also be used as a reverse proxy, where it acts as a middleman and redirects traffic that it captures. This is useful for debugging web applications on devices such as the Apple iPad that do not natively support use of a web proxy.</p><p>More information about Charles can be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.charlesproxy.com/">http://www.charlesproxy.com/</a>.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec44"/>Fiddler</h2></div></div></div><a id="id141" class="indexterm"/><a id="id142" class="indexterm"/><p>Fiddler is a web proxy that is built specifically for Windows and requires the .NET Framework Version 2.0 or later.
