The Knockout library is well-known because it is a pair of boxing gloves that work well in the ring! What jQuery did for JavaScript years ago, Knockout is doing for smart data management with the browser elements. With this library, you will find another way to enjoy building web technology, while building sites that end users will enjoy just as much. If you know the basics of JavaScript and HTML, this book will soon make you a champion.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>First, you will need a computer with a web server. The examples will run on any common server, so a special server-side language is not required. You will need a text editor, and if you want to use the exercise files, you will need to be able to decompress a ZIP file. There is a built-in provision for this in most modern computers. Finally, you will need a browser to view your work.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is for web developers or web designers who work with HTML and wants to gain knowledge while making things simple. This will show you how to automate, with some simple markup, the interaction between your data and the visual side of the browser. If you are looking to get the best experience with cleaner and more sustainable code, this book will serve you well.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and explanations of their meanings.</p><p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "We will need to use the <code class="literal">push</code> method of our bound array collection to add this."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">&lt;button data-bind="click: sort('name')"&gt;Sort By Name&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button data-bind="click: sort('item')"&gt;Sort By Item&lt;/button&gt;</pre></div><p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">this.orderVM = new ko.simpleGrid.viewModel({
data: this.orders,
<strong>columns: [</strong>
<strong>{ headerText: "Customer", rowText: "name"},</strong>
<strong>{ headerText: "Item", rowText: "item"},</strong>
<strong>{ headerText: "Count", rowText: "qty"}</strong>
<strong>],</strong>
<strong>pageSize: 3</strong>
});</pre></div><p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>&gt; pagedOrderModel.orders()</strong>
</pre></div><p>
<strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "Click on the <strong>Add Staff</strong> button."</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip01"/>Tip</h3><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p></div></div></div>
