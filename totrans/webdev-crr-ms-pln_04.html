<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">Over the last two chapters, we’ve spent a fair amount of time looking at actual code and getting you acclimated to the nuts and bolts, so to speak, of web development. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">It should be obvious that most of your time will likely be spent “twiddling bits,” as we software nerds like </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">to say!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">But you’ve also seen that there is a lot more to it than just </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">writing</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1"> code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">In this chapter, we’ll look at a few more of those “not writing code” things, including the idea of source control (how you keep track of the changes to your code), operating systems (Linux in particular), </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">integrated development environments</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">IDEs</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">) (tools that help you write code </span><a id="_idIndexMarker299"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">without leaving one consolidated application), security, and even one or two other languages that commonly come into play for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">web developers.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">In this chapter, we’ll touch on the following “non-code,” so to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">speak, topics:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">As in the previous chapter, I will assume you have already downloaded the source code for this book from GitHub, as outlined in the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">Technical requirements</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1"> section of </span><a href="B18315_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor061"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">Chapter 2</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">For this chapter, we’ll again be dealing with the code in the </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">ch-03/2-spa</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1"> directory.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">The other thing you’ll need to do is get Git installed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.2">For that, head over to </span><a href="https://git-scm.com"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">https://git-scm.com</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1"> and find the download package appropriate for your system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">I will leave this as an exercise for you, but it’s nothing unusual, so I know you can </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">handle it.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-108"><a id="_idTextAnchor108"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">Controlling the code – source control management systems</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">Okay; so, you’ve spent </span><a id="_idIndexMarker300"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">a few hours hacking code – maybe you’ve built a nifty-keen little user registration page, for example. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">As someone in the mafia might say: it’d be a shame if something were to happen to that code, wouldn’t it? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.3">Surely there must be a way to protect your code, and indeed, there</span><a id="_idIndexMarker301"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1"> is: </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">source control</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">Let me start by telling you how us old fogies used to do </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">source control.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">Every so often, we would create a new directory in our project directory and name it something like “HTML_complete_8-6-1991_1-30pm.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">Then, we’d copy all the files from our project into it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.3">We’d work on the project a little more, and maybe later we’d create another directory named “JS_complete_8-6-1991_4:30pm” and again copy all the project files </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">into it.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">Think that through for a moment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">At the point I completed the HTML for the project, I essentially made a backup of the current state of all the files in my project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.3">When the JavaScript was done, I made another copy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.4">What I had was a history of the files in the project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.5">Later, if I was working on the JavaScript and made a mistake and found it suddenly didn’t work, I could go back to one of those directories and compare the JavaScript to what it was when it </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">last worked.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">While it was ugly and completely manual, this was essentially a form of source control, or </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">version control</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1"> as it’s</span><a id="_idIndexMarker302"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1"> often called (for obvious reasons: each directory represents a past version of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">the code).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">Further, we would frequently, often at the end of the day, copy all those directories onto some central server somewhere, one that was being properly backed up all the time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">This provides a layer of protection: even if the hard drive in our computer were to die, we’d have a copy of our code on that server. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.3">We might lose some work if we were in the middle of coding and hadn’t created a new version directory recently, but it’s better than having lost everything. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.4">At least we could get back to the last saved version </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">at worst.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">It’s a good system in that it provides history and some level of protection, but being so manual means it’s very prone to errors. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.2">Plus, it’s not all that robust. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.3">For example, if we need to compare a file to a previous version, how do we do that? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.4">Back then, it was as “simple” as “putting both files on the screen side-by-side, going through them, and trying to spot the changes.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.5">That’s not a great approach. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.6">And then there are other things you might want to do, such as keep notes alongside the code about your progress. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.7">Sure, you could create a </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">notes.txt</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1"> file and save it, but again, it’s a manual process, and it also varies from developer to developer since no two will likely land on the same directory naming conventions </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">and approaches.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">Surely there must</span><a id="_idIndexMarker303"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1"> now, literally decades later, be a better answer, right? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">Indeed, there is: </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">source code </span></strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">management</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1"> (</span></span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">SCM</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">).</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-109"><a id="_idTextAnchor109"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">Introducing SCM</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">This is where SCM </span><a id="_idIndexMarker304"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">comes in. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.2">An SCM system, or version control system, as we say, is a piece of software that records changes to your project files over time, more or less automatically. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.3">SCM provides ways for you to review the history of your project, compare files, recall specific versions of files, attach notes to your changes, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">and more.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">They also do something else that was difficult back in the ugly manual source control days: they allow multiple developers to work on the same code simultaneously. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.2">They do this by tracking the changes of each contributor and managing the process of </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">merging</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.2">Merging is </span><a id="_idIndexMarker305"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">when you have two copies of a file with changes from two different people (usually – though it </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">could</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1"> be the same person), and you need to combine the changes into one canonical version of the file. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">When you’re a single developer working on a project, this is unlikely to ever come up, but it’s a crucial concern in software development when working on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">a team.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">SCM is considered a foundational tool in software development, meaning that in a professional environment, you’ll virtually always be using SCM. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">These days, it’s even unusual for a single developer to not use SCM since there is tremendous value in being able to go back in time, so to speak, and see what a file looked like at various points </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">in time.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">SCM has a couple of key points </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">to it:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">Version tracking</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">: SCM keeps a history of every change made to the files in a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">repository</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">, or repo for short, which is another way to describe your project directory (it’s not </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">exactly</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1"> the same, but conceptually, that’s the way you can think of it for now). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">Not only does it keep a record of the file’s contents, but it also includes who changed it and when the changes were made, and it usually includes some sort of note about the change from the developer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.3">This helps track the progress of your project, understand how the code base is evolving, and of course gives you a way to roll </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">back changes.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">Rollback</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">: This is</span><a id="_idIndexMarker306"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1"> simply the ability to retrieve a previous version of a file if problems are found (or if you just decide that subsequent changes can be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">thrown away).</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">Collaboration</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">: Multiple developers can work on the same code base simultaneously. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.2">An SCM system manages changes from different people and merges them, allowing for collaborative work without overwriting each </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">other’s contributions.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">Branching</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">: Sometimes, developers may need to work on something that is somewhat experimental. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.2">To avoid such experiments messing up the existing presumably good code, they can create a branch, which effectively is a copy of the project at the time the branch is created. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.3">The developer then does their work, saving their changes to that branch, all the while not touching the good code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.4">Eventually, if the experiment proves fruitful, it can be merged into the good code, making it a permanent part of the main </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">project code.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">Conflict resolution</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">: When two copies of a file are merged, they may sometimes conflict – for example, if two developers change the same line of code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.2">When that happens, the SCM can alert the developer attempting to merge the code that there is a conflict that they need to manually resolve (which usually means deciding which file the change should come from), and then completing </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">the merge.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">Safety</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">: SCM serves as a backup, of sorts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.2">If project files become corrupt, they can be retrieved</span><a id="_idIndexMarker307"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1"> from the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">SCM system.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">Now that you know what SCM is, let’s talk about the options you have in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">SCM systems.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-110"><a id="_idTextAnchor110"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">Accepting the false choice – Git it is!</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">Look, I’m just</span><a id="_idIndexMarker308"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1"> going to cut to</span><a id="_idIndexMarker309"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1"> the chase here: you almost don’t have a choice in what SCM system to use nowadays, it’s gonna be something </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">called Git.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">There are several SCM systems out there; names such as Mercurial, CVS, Subversion, Bitbucket, and Perforce are ones you may have heard of. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.2">But the simple truth is that the industry has almost entirely coalesced around Git, created by the same person who created the Linux operating system: Linus Torvalds. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.3">Git was built in 2005 specifically for those working on the Linux kernel to be able to collaborate </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">more easily.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">Git is somewhat unique from many other SCM systems in that it is </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">distributed</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.2">What this means is that every developer has a copy of an entire Git repository, including a full history of all changes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.3">This is unusual in that most other SCMs are </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">centralized</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">, meaning there is one canonical copy of the code, plus all the history that goes along with it, and developers only get copies of the code on their machines to work on, and never the full history. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.2">The benefit of a distributed SCM is that they do not require a network connection to a central server all the time as a centralized SCM does (though it’s important to note that in </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">most</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1"> cases, even when you use Git, there </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">is</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1"> a centralized copy – it’s just that you don’t need to be constantly connected to it with Git like with other </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">SCM systems).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">Git became popular for many reasons, but one of the big ones is speed and performance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.2">With other SCMs, merging changes can sometimes take a fair bit of time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.3">We’re not talking about hours here, but even a few seconds add up throughout a workday. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.4">Git is very optimized for speed from the ground up and most operations happen almost instantly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.5">One of the key ways in which Git’s performance won over most developers is when it comes to branching. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.6">The way Git does branching is fundamentally different from most other SCM systems and is far more lightweight. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.7">While creating a branch in Subversion, for example, may take several seconds or even minutes if the content you’re branching from is large enough, with Git, it’s practically instant, no matter the size of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">the content.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">Because Git gained a lot of popularity very quickly – and at this point, it is the de facto standard SCM in the software development world – everyone started integrating it into other tools, So, now, today, you can work with Git in practically every bit of developer tooling out there, some of which we’ll get to later in this chapter. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.2">It has a very large community and support system, so any time you run into problems with Git, you’ll have no problem </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">getting help.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">Git can be (relatively) simply used from the command line, and many developers will tell you that this is </span><a id="_idIndexMarker310"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">best</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1"> way to use</span><a id="_idIndexMarker311"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1"> Git. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.2">I’m not one of those developers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.3">But I do think it’s where you should </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">start</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">, so that’s exactly what we’ll </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">do now!</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-111"><a id="_idTextAnchor111"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">Getting started with Git</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">What we’re </span><a id="_idIndexMarker312"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">going to do here is add source control </span><a id="_idIndexMarker313"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">to the project from the previous chapter (more specifically, the SPA version in the </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">ch-03/2-spa</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1"> directory of the source code download you should already have by now). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.2">This allows you to begin making changes to the code and allows Git to track and manage those changes for you, providing you with all the benefits that SCM confers (such as being able to go back to previous </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">versions later).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">What you’ll want to do is start by making a copy of the project directory. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.2">Then, look for a </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1">.git</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1"> directory inside </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1">of it:</span></span></p>

<p><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.521.1">GitHub</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.522.1"> is to Git as</span><a id="_idIndexMarker341"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.1"> a computer is to electricity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.2">While it is the electricity – and Git – that do the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker342"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.524.1">actual work, you would probably prefer the experience of interacting with a computer – and GitHub! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.524.2">As you saw in the previous section, you can work with Git on a command line, but you may have noticed it isn’t the most pleasant experience. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.524.3">And believe me when I say that you’ve only seen the basics… it </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.525.1">gets worse!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.526.1">But GitHub seeks to solve that problem by providing a much more user-friendly way to work with Git. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.526.2">GitHub, as you presumably saw when you accessed the code for this book, is a web-based platform where developers store and manage their projects, and optionally make them available to the world. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.526.3">It’s built on top of Git, and while Git handles the nitty-gritty of tracking changes to files in a project, GitHub provides a user-friendly interface to work with it, plus a lot of extra features, such as bug tracking, task management, social networking features for developers, and even hosting of projects such as websites (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.527.1">GitHub Pages</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.1">, as it’s</span><a id="_idIndexMarker343"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.529.1"> called). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.529.2">Think of Git as the engine under the hood, and GitHub as the car built around it, offering a more comfortable and feature-rich ride than the engine alone would (boy, the visual image of someone riding a car engine down the road is something, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.530.1">isn’t it?).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.531.1">GitHub allows you to clone a repo, work on it locally, and then push changes to it (subject to privileges to do so, one of the added features it puts on top of Git). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.531.2">GitHub also offers </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.532.1">Actions</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.533.1">, which are bits of code the owner of a repo can set up to execute when various events occur. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.533.2">For example, there may be an Action to build the project whenever someone pushes to the repo, and then deploy a new version of the project, say a website, where it can be accessed </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.534.1">by all.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.535.1">GitHub adds an issue tracker to repos so that users of your project can submit bug reports and you can track and manage progress on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.536.1">their resolution.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.537.1">GitHub provides an online code editing platform too, so you could work on a project entirely on GitHub itself if you wanted to. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.537.2">Many developers like their tools to be local on their machines, and</span><a id="_idIndexMarker344"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.538.1"> they use GitHub as just a remote repository, but it can do a lot</span><a id="_idIndexMarker345"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.539.1"> more if you </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.540.1">so choose.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.541.1">GitHub even offers AI in the form of CoPilot. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.541.2">This is a feature that can provide real-time coding suggestions as you type, saving you time and maybe even solutions to problems you would have otherwise gotten stuck on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.541.3">It does this by training the AI on repos in GitHub, so you in effect get the combined knowledge, wisdom, and experience of everyone else </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.542.1">using GitHub.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.543.1">I could go on because GitHub is more than just a host of Git repos – it’s more like a central hub for developers to do their work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.543.2">But the great thing about it is that you can dip a toe in at the start and then jump in completely later, or leave just the toe in. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.543.3">It’s entirely up to you how far into GitHub you go. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.543.4">And I should point out that there are alternatives to GitHub. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.543.5">But the simple truth is that GitHub is pretty much king. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.543.6">It is used by far more developers than any competitor out there. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.543.7">You’ll almost certainly deal with GitHub in some fashion as you continue your web developer journey, it’s just a question of to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.544.1">what extent.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.545.1">I assume that you’ve downloaded the code for this book, which means you’ve already created a GitHub account. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.545.2">But if you haven’t, now is the time! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.545.3">Either way, I strongly suggest spending some time playing around on GitHub. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.545.4">I would suggest creating a repo, adding a file or two, and editing them, all on GitHub itself. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.545.5">Then, practice cloning the repo onto your local machine, edit and add files again, and then push to GitHub and see how the changes show up there. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.545.6">I think you’ll quickly see the value in GitHub and appreciate how it smooths some of the rough edges of Git in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.546.1">the process.</span></span></p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-114"><a id="_idTextAnchor114"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.551.1">Thinking like a hacker – securing the web</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.1">Creating secure </span><a id="_idIndexMarker348"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.553.1">websites takes a lot of time, effort, and attention to detail across several layers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.553.2">“Security-in-depth” is a common phrase that means you don’t just lock the door – you also have a security camera, a guard dog, and bars on the windows to keep your home safe. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.553.3">In the same way, writing secure code is part of it, as is ensuring your servers are “hardened” against attacks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.553.4">This is an extremely expansive topic, and it has only grown in importance over the years. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.553.5">We’ve all certainly seen all the security breaches that have happened in recent years, and most of us have probably been personally impacted in some way. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.553.6">Unfortunately, this stuff ain’t easy to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.554.1">get right.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.555.1">But it all starts with writing secure code, and to do that, you must have some knowledge of the types of things hackers – or </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.556.1">threat actors</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.557.1">, as we call them in professional circles – look for in your code to exploit. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.557.2">Well, they usually aren’t looking at your code per se; they’re looking at your website, trying to infer how your code is written, and then looking for weaknesses </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.558.1">in it.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-115"><a id="_idTextAnchor115"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.559.1">Common exploits</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.560.1">The good news is that </span><a id="_idIndexMarker349"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.561.1">these days, exploits – weaknesses that a hacker can use to breach your security – by and large fall into a few </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.562.1">broad categories.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.563.1">SQL injection</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.564.1">Without knowing </span><a id="_idIndexMarker350"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.565.1">what SQL is, this one is hard to explain. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.565.2">But, to</span><a id="_idIndexMarker351"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.566.1"> give you the crib notes version… SQL is a special language that allows you to get data out of a database. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.566.2">For example, if your database contains a list of checking accounts, you might get a list of them by executing the </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.567.1">select * from checking_accounts</span></strong> <span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.568.1">SQL statement.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.569.1">A </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.570.1">SQL injection</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.571.1"> attack works on the premise of such statements in conjunction with the fact that developers don’t always code them safely. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.571.2">When they don’t, it allows a threat actor to modify those statements through clever values in forms. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.571.3">By doing so, they are then able to access data they shouldn’t be able to. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.571.4">Thankfully, this is an easy problem to avoid: it just requires developers to write code that uses SQL statements in a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.572.1">specific way.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.573.1">Cross-site scripting (XSS)</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.574.1">XSS is a technique </span><a id="_idIndexMarker352"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.575.1">threat actors use</span><a id="_idIndexMarker353"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.576.1"> that allows them to inject malicious scripts (we’re talking about JavaScript here) into content viewed by other users, potentially stealing data, or impersonating users. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.576.2">This exploit is a great example of why security is so difficult: you may be thinking that this requires someone to be able to access your server to modify your code, but that’s not the case. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.576.3">Instead, clever usage of things such as email, where it’s often possible to embed links and other web content, allows someone to embed their malicious script, which can then launch a web browser to your legitimate site, with that script then able to do its dirty work as if it was part of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.577.1">your website.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.578.1">The main point here is that threat actors will often attack your website </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.579.1">indirectly</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.580.1">, in ways that won’t even initially make sense to you because they do things in ways that you never normally would. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.580.2">“Thinking like a hacker” requires you to have a good understanding of how things work on the web to then be able to connect things in ways they were never intended to get to an exploit, and sometimes, those connected things may be several steps removed from the target of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.581.1">the attack.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.582.1">You can take steps to remove potentially dangerous content from anything sent to the server, and you can encode output in special ways so that even if something slips through, it won’t have the desired effect when it gets to the user’s browser. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.582.2">For example, when taking in data from the user, you can look for any instances of JavaScript keywords and strip them out, because that’s rarely something you want to allow in user input. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.582.3">You would need to do this on the server side to be safe, so you would run all user input through a cleansing function that looks for those keywords, or other potentially problematic strings such as </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.583.1">&lt;script&gt;</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.584.1">, and remove them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.584.2">You would also want to do the same thing on the output side, meaning any data you send to the browser should similarly be cleansed just in case something slipped into your data through another means, such as a data load to your database (when this happens, it’s called a stored XSS attack because the malicious content somehow got stored and might have an effect when returned</span><a id="_idIndexMarker354"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.585.1"> to</span><a id="_idIndexMarker355"/> <span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.586.1">the browser).</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.587.1">Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.588.1">CSRF is a way</span><a id="_idIndexMarker356"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.589.1"> to trick a user’s browser</span><a id="_idIndexMarker357"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.590.1"> into executing some unwanted action and it appearing to be a legitimate action from the user. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.590.2">This comes in several forms, with one of the more common ways being when a website uses a cookie – small pieces of information stored on a user’s browser – to identify that user. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.590.3">If someone can steal that cookie, they can effectively impersonate the legitimate user. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.590.4">Imagine stealing the cookie for a user’s banking site – a threat actor could transfer all the money out before the real user is aware </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.591.1">of it.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.592.1">Stealing cookies isn’t always as hard as it sounds if certain precautions aren’t taken (cookies have various security settings that developers should set properly to make them much more difficult to steal). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.592.2">Usage of a CSRF token is also common, which is a unique, random string that changes with each request. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.592.3">This way, even if someone steals your cookies, without the CSRF token, they wouldn’t be able to do anything. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.592.4">Other variations of CSRF require other mitigations, but </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.593.1">it’s situation-specific.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.594.1">In addition to defenses for specific exploits like these, there are some basic coding practices you can use to help avoid </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.595.1">security issues.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-116"><a id="_idTextAnchor116"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.596.1">Secure coding practices</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.597.1">As you write code, you</span><a id="_idIndexMarker358"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.598.1"> should keep a few key things in mind. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.598.2">Doing so will help you avoid not only the previously mentioned issues but a whole </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.599.1">lot more.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.600.1">Implement secure authentication</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.601.1">You should always </span><a id="_idIndexMarker359"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.602.1">implement strong password policies and use </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.603.1">multi-factor authentication</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.604.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.605.1">MFA</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.606.1">) to </span><a id="_idIndexMarker360"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.607.1">protect user accounts where possible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.607.2">MFA means that a user must prove themselves through more than one factor, where a factor is something you are, something you know, and something you have. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.607.3">For example, logging into a site may require a username (who you are) a password (what you know), and perhaps a one-time code sent to your phone (something you have). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.607.4">While a threat actor managing to steal your password can happen (and your username isn’t generally considered sensitive in the first place), it’s unlikely they would also have your cell phone, so by requiring multiple factors, you’ve now defended </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.608.1">that website.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.609.1">Use encryption</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.610.1">Unless you have </span><a id="_idIndexMarker361"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.611.1">a very good reason not to, you should always use HTTPS so that the data that is transmitted between a browser and a server is encrypted. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.611.2">(The only good reason I can think of not to use HTTPS nowadays is when working on your machine during development since there is more configuration involved to use HTTPS than plain old HTTP that you simply may not want to deal with </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.612.1">during development.)</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.613.1">This avoids a form of attack</span><a id="_idIndexMarker362"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.614.1"> called </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.615.1">Man-in-the-Middle</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.616.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.617.1">MITM</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.618.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.618.2">In such an attack, a threat actor might gain control of a router on the network that your data passes through when sent to the server. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.618.3">In that situation, they can view that data, which may well include your username and password, and if you don’t have MFA, they can then log in as you all they want. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.618.4">Encryption makes it so that all they’ll ever see is a stream </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.619.1">of gibberish.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.620.1">Handle errors properly</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.621.1">When you write </span><a id="_idIndexMarker363"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.622.1">code, almost every language has ways that you can handle error conditions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.622.2">This is important because when such errors occur, they can leak information about the underlying architecture of your website, or even allow a threat actor to sneak snippets of code that can then be executed in the context of your code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.622.3">To avoid this, you should always ensure that error messages displayed to users give as little information as possible about your technology stack, and you should always try to use the error handling mechanisms your language of choice provides so that nothing can “slip out,” so to speak, that a threat actor can use </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.623.1">against you.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.624.1">Perform code reviews and do robust testing</span></h3>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.629.1">Static code analysis tools look at your code without executing it and look for patterns that frequently denote security concerns. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.629.2">Static analysis can uncover other problems, not just security problems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.629.3">It can find logic flaws that might result in bugs and can point out places where your code isn’t written to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.630.1">acceptable standards.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.631.1">Penetration testing, usually abbreviated as pen testing, involves people (known as “white hat” hackers) actively trying to hack your website – with your approval, of course! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.631.2">They, try to find ways past your security by, for example, looking for clues about what technology you’re using and then searching for known vulnerabilities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.631.3">They can also look for flaws in your code, based just on how it works, that allows them to breach </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.632.1">your security.</span></span></p>

<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.635.1">Implement the principle of least privilege</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.636.1">This is typically more</span><a id="_idIndexMarker366"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.637.1"> at the operating system level than the code level, but sometimes, it does leak into the code level. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.637.2">Regardless, the idea is that you should only grant the permissions necessary to perform a task to a given user, reducing the potential impact of a breach if one should occur. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.637.3">Remember when we discussed the root user in Linux earlier? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.637.4">Well, if a threat actor can gain access as the root user, they have the keys to the kingdom – they can do anything. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.637.5">However, if they can only get into your server as a user who has limited access rights to files and directories, then even though they’ve breached your security, the damage they can do </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.638.1">is limited.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.639.1">Set security headers</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.640.1">Servers can set </span><a id="_idIndexMarker367"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.641.1">various headers on responses to browsers that </span><a id="_idIndexMarker368"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.642.1">are called </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.643.1">content security policy</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.644.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.645.1">CSP</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.646.1">) headers, as well as X-Frame-Options and Strict-Transport-Security headers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.646.2">These tell the browser what they are allowed to do with the content the server returns. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.646.3">Properly configuring these headers can limit what a threat actor can do on your website, in some cases eliminating certain classes of exploits entirely (well, “entirely” is never a good thing to say when it comes to web security, but it certainly makes it much more challenging for the bad guys, which is essentially the overall goal to all of this – make it so difficult that it</span><a id="_idIndexMarker369"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.647.1"> isn’t worth their </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.648.1">time basically).</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.649.1">Do regular updates</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.650.1">You should almost</span><a id="_idIndexMarker370"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.651.1"> always use the latest versions of things such as languages, libraries, and server software because they tend to have been patched against previously discovered security problems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.651.2">New ones can always be discovered, so this is something that is an </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.652.1">ongoing task.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.653.1">Validate input</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.654.1">When you get</span><a id="_idIndexMarker371"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.655.1"> data from a client, you must always assume it contains security exploits. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.655.2">From the perspective of the server, a client is never to be trusted! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.655.3">So, we do things such as sanitizing input data, which means ensuring that all input data meets specific criteria to prevent malformed data from entering the system, this could lead to exploits. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.655.4">For example, if you have a form field that is for entering the user’s age, that’s intended to be a number. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.655.5">And, even if you have JavaScript on the page that ensures that’s the case, a threat actor has other ways to make that data not be a number. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.655.6">When the server gets it, if it assumes it’s a number – if it assumes the client is trusted – then non-numeric data can slip in, and there might be a way to use that to a threat actor’s benefit. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.655.7">Therefore, your server code </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.656.1">must</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.657.1"> validate that what the client sent </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.658.1">is</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.659.1"> a number as expected. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.659.2">Never, ever, ever trust the client! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.659.3">If you remember nothing else from this entire section, remember this, because it alone will help you avoid many, if not most, security exploits </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.660.1">out there.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.661.1">Encode output</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.662.1">Imagine that you</span><a id="_idIndexMarker372"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.663.1"> have a website that gets stock ticker values from a remote service. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.663.2">Further, imagine that you store that data in your database and show it to your users. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.663.3">Now, your website might be perfectly coded, so it sanitizes all the data it gets from the user. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.663.4">Hooray! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.663.5">But what about the data you get from that remote service? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.663.6">Did </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.664.1">they</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.665.1"> do </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.666.1">their</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.667.1"> job as well as </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.668.1">you</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.669.1"> did? </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.670.1">Maybe not!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.671.1">In that case, you may wind up with malicious content in the form of JavaScript code stored in your database, and then when you render that JavaScript on your page, it can execute within the context of your page as if you had written it yourself, but doing the bidding of the bad guys. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.671.2">This is called a stored CSS attack because the malicious code was stored somewhere and snuck in “through the back door,” so to speak. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.671.3">To avoid this, you need to encode the data that is sent to your clients, removing certain content that can lead </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.672.1">to exploits.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.673.1">How this encoding is implemented varies greatly depending on many factors – far too many to detail here. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.673.2">But generally, it involves replacing certain characters or sequences of characters with others that are considered safe. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.673.3">Just as one example, if a user can submit data that contains the text </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.674.1">alert(1)</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.675.1"> and it is saved in your database and is then later used on your page, that JavaScript code will execute as if you wrote it yourself. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.675.2">To deal with </span><a id="_idIndexMarker373"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.676.1">that, you may need to encode the </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.677.1">(</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.678.1"> and </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.679.1">)</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.680.1"> characters as  </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.681.1">&amp;#40;</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.682.1"> and </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.683.1">&amp;#41;</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.684.1">, respectively, which are special sequences that will ensure the code </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.685.1">isn’t executed.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.686.1">Securely manage configuration</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.687.1">It is common to need</span><a id="_idIndexMarker374"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.688.1"> certain pieces of sensitive information in your code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.688.2">For example, your code may need a username and password to connect to a database. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.688.3">If you embed this information in your code, then anyone who manages to see the code now has those credentials. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.688.4">This can be avoided by securely storing those credentials, usually in some special system specialized and designed for such sensitive information. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.688.5">Your code will then request the credentials from that system only when needed, and then they are only ever stored in the server’s memory for a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.689.1">short period.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.690.1">Monitor file uploads</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.691.1">If your application</span><a id="_idIndexMarker375"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.692.1"> allows file uploads, ensure that they are scanned for malware and have strict controls on the types and sizes of files. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.692.2">If you are building a website where people can show others their photo albums, for example, you’ll want to implement code that ensures only graphics files are uploaded. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.692.3">Plus, you will probably want to have code that ensures no file greater than maybe 10 Mb is uploaded. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.692.4">This way, you can stop users from uploading, say, large executable files that could be malware through which to attack </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.693.1">your server.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.694.1">Secure data storage properly</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.695.1">Something that</span><a id="_idIndexMarker376"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.696.1"> comes up often is needing to store user credentials – usernames and passwords, most typically. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.696.2">You may think that storing them in a database on your server is safe, but that isn’t the case. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.696.3">Someone may be able to gain access to that database. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.696.4">And if you store it in a file instead of a database, then the same may </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.697.1">be true.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.698.1">No, you have to store that data securely. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.698.2">How would you do so in this case? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.698.3">You may think that you can encrypt the password and store that, right? </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.699.1">Encryption</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.700.1"> is when we take a value </span><a id="_idIndexMarker377"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.701.1">and generate another value that looks like gibberish, but where that gibberish can be used to reproduce the original value given another value – the key – that was used to encrypt it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.701.2">In other words, encryption is a two-way function: one way encrypts some data given a key value and the other way de-crypts it (turns it back into the original data) given </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.702.1">the key.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.703.1">That seems safe, right? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.703.2">Even if someone gets your database, they’ll just see gibberish for the password (the username doesn’t typically need to be protected in any way). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.703.3">That’s true… unless they also get your encryption key! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.703.4">And that may not be very hard considering your code has to have the key to decrypt the password and see if what the user entered </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.704.1">is correct.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.705.1">Instead, what you should do in this case is hash the password. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.705.2">Unlike encryption, which is two-way, </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.706.1">hashing</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.707.1"> is </span><a id="_idIndexMarker378"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.708.1">a one-way cryptographic function, meaning it takes in a value, runs it through some complex math, and spits out another value that, critically, can never be reversed to get the original value, but that will always generate the same has value for that same input value. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.708.2">This is useful for passwords especially. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.708.3">Say my password is </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.709.1">abc123</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.710.1"> (not a good password, but work with me here!). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.710.2">If we hash that password, we might get a hash value of </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.711.1">z9x8</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.712.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.712.2">So, we can never take </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.713.1">z9x8</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.714.1"> and get </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.715.1">abc123</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.716.1"> from it, but we’ll always get </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.717.1">z9x8</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.718.1"> if we feed the hash </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.719.1">function </span></span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.720.1">abc123</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.721.1">.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.722.1">This is useful because if we store </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.723.1">z9x8</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.724.1"> in our database, it means that even if someone steals it, they can never get the real password. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.724.2">But our server code can still validate that user! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.724.3">All it has to do is take the password they enter when logging in and hash it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.724.4">If the has value we get matches the hash value stored in the database, then we know they entered the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.725.1">right password.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.726.1">The difference between hashing and encrypting is something that developers often get wrong in my experience, and this scenario is a common one where knowing the difference is the difference between a secure login system versus one </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.727.1">that isn’t.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.728.1">By incorporating these (and other) practices, web developers can significantly reduce the attack surface – all the different paths through your security a threat actor might exploit – of web applications and defend against the ever-evolving landscape of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.729.1">cyber threats.</span></span></p>

<p class="callout"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.731.1">Hashes aren’t just for passwords and security. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.731.2">You saw them used earlier when discussing Git. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.731.3">Hashes there work the same way – the content of a commit is run through a hash function to generate the hash value – but in Git, it’s used not for security but for uniquely identifying a commit since a hash value would be unique to the content that was committed given that there is no other combination of characters that could result in the same hash value (strictly speaking, this isn’t 100% true, but the odds of two different input strings producing the same hash value – something we call a hash collision – is statistically so unlikely that we can say </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.732.1">it’s true).</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.789.1">Developers tend to like VS Code because it “gets out of their way.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.789.2">Some people find some other IDEs to have a little </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.790.1">too</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.791.1"> much capability, believe it or not! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.791.2">After all, at the end of the day, it all comes down to the code you’re writing, so an environment that takes space away from seeing your code is sometimes not what you want. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.791.3">VS Code, by default at least, does a good job of focusing on your code, but you can add to it later as you </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.792.1">see fit.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.865.1">So, you write </span><a id="_idIndexMarker399"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.866.1">your code, and you write it securely, and you get it under SCM. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.866.2">But what do you do when it comes time to deploy your code – that is, put it where it will run? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.866.3">There’s no singular answer to this question because how and where you can run your code is a question with myriad answers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.866.4">But one thing is for sure: they’re all going to involve an operating system of some sort in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.867.1">some fashion.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.868.1">While Windows is, at the time of writing, still the world’s most popular desktop operating system, the story is very different when we talk about servers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.868.2">While you will find a good number of Windows-based servers out there too, most servers </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.869.1">run Linux.</span></span></p>
<p><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.870.1">Linux</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.871.1"> is an open-source operating system written and first released by Linus Torvalds in 1991. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.871.2">The basic architecture of Linux is based on the Unix operating system, which was initially released way back in 1971, though it has a history – in a slightly different form – stretching back to the 1960s. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.871.3">Linux’s history is also the history of the internet in a sense as its use grew right alongside the internet. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.871.4">It became the backbone for server infrastructure, powering websites and online services due to its robustness and flexibility, and is also the poster child for </span><a id="_idIndexMarker400"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.872.1">the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.873.1">free/open-source software</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.874.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.875.1">FOSS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.876.1">) movement as easily the largest and most well-known open source </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.877.1">project ever.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.878.1">Unix, and hence Linux, is stable, generally secure, and free, which makes it quite popular for many purposes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.878.2">It is fundamentally based on principles of modularity and reusability, meaning it can be tweaked and reorganized with specific goals in mind. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.878.3">It is this quality that makes it flexible and gives rise to hundreds, if not thousands, of distributions – or </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.879.1">distros</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.880.1"> – which are just variants of Linux, different collections of system libraries and tweaked kernels and such. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.880.2">Different distros have different focuses. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.880.3">Some are built as specifically as web servers; some are geared toward desktop machines; some have very small memory and hardware requirements making them ideal for small embedded systems; some are targeted to musicians; some are targeted to scientists… and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.881.1">so on.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.886.1">The basic structure </span><a id="_idIndexMarker402"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.887.1">of Linux can be understood as a series of layers, one on top of the other. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.887.2">Starting from the lowest layer, we have </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.888.1">the following:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.889.1">Kernel</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.890.1">: A piece of software that’s responsible for managing hardware resources primarily – things such as the CPU, memory, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.891.1">peripheral devices.</span></span></li>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-125"><a id="_idTextAnchor125"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.986.1">Security and the one “weird” Linux fact you need to know</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.987.1">Linux is, at its</span><a id="_idIndexMarker409"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.988.1"> core, very security-conscious. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.988.2">It is also at its core a multi-user system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.988.3">Every file and directory is owned by a specific user and user group, and a user who doesn’t own a file or isn’t in an appropriate group cannot access it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.988.4">Linux has a robust system of permissions, which is to say the various rights a user or group has for a file or directory. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.988.5">You can give users the right to read a file but not edit it, for example. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.988.6">The ability to run a file – assuming it’s a program of some sort – is its own right, meaning you might be able to read and edit a program file but not </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.989.1">execute it.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.990.1">Permissions are hierarchical as well, meaning that you can be granted rights to a directory, which then filters down to the directories and files under it by default (though you can alter the rights for a specific file or subdirectory too). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.990.2">This allows for very granular control over access rights for various users, making it safe for them to work on the same system without risking conflicting with </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.991.1">one another.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.992.1">The one exception to all this security stuff is the special root user. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.992.2">This user is, in a sense, the god of the machine. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.992.3">The root user can do anything, to any file or directory, at any time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.992.4">There is always a root user account, although sometimes, it may not be usable by any human user. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.992.5">This is necessary because some operations are so core to Linux itself that no other user </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.993.1">should</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.994.1"> be able to do it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.994.2">Or it should be very limited at the least. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.994.3">In such cases, Linux offers the ability to temporarily “switch” to the root user, meaning you can, as a regular old user, execute a specific command as if you were the root user, assuming you’ve been granted special rights to do that. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.994.4">This allows high-level system management tasks to be available to users as needed but in a very tightly </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.995.1">controlled fashion.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.996.1">I’ve mentioned files several times, and surely you know what files are because they’re no different from any other operating system, but Linux has one fact that is a little weird when you first encounter it – everything in Linux is a file. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.996.2">And when I say everything, I mean (</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.997.1">almost) </span></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.998.1">everything</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.999.1">.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1000.1">In Linux, “everything is</span><a id="_idIndexMarker410"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1001.1"> a file” means that the operating system allows you to work with things that aren’t files the same way you do actual files. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1001.2">To put it another way, it’s the idea that Linux handles input and output to and from resources such as hard drives, modems, keyboards, printers, and other system resources and devices as streams of data exposed through the filesystem, as if they were files on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1002.1">that filesystem.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1003.1">The consequence of this is that not only can actual files be interacted with from the command line or other programs using file operations such as reading and writing, but so can directories, system information, hardware devices, and even some system processes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1003.2">For example, accessing a device such as a printer might involve writing data to a file that represents the printer, which will cause the printer to physically print that data on a piece of paper. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1003.3">Or you might read from a file representing the system’s memory usage to see how much free memory you have. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1003.4">This design makes programming and resource management more uniform and simpler since you don’t need to use any special methods to deal with hardware devices and system resources, and you can use all the same commands and utilities as you would with </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1004.1">regular files.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1005.1">Now that you have a (very) broad idea of what Linux is all about, let’s talk about why it’s even important</span><a id="_idIndexMarker411"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1006.1"> to know about for a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1007.1">web developer.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-126"><a id="_idTextAnchor126"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1008.1">Linux for web developers</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1009.1">With Linux being so </span><a id="_idIndexMarker412"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1010.1">commonly used for servers, that means knowing </span><a id="_idIndexMarker413"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1011.1">Linux is a valuable thing for a web developer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1011.2">Now, to be clear, there is knowing Linux and then there’s </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1012.1">knowing</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1013.1"> Linux. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1013.2">A web developer probably doesn’t need to be a stone-cold Linux expert like, say, a server administrator does; those folks must have very deep knowledge of the system and how to work with it, and that simply takes a lot of time and experience. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1013.3">Certainly, as a web developer, the more you know the better, but you can start slowly with just some basics, and that’ll be sufficient so that you </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1014.1">aren’t lost.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1015.1">Fortunately, getting your feet wet with Linux is pretty easy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1015.2">Several websites will let you run Linux in your browser or will connect you to a Linux instance on the server that you can then interact with through your browser. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1015.3">Either way, you’ll get a command-line interface right there in your browser, with no need to install Linux on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1016.1">your machine!</span></span></p>

<pre class="source-code"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1087.1">

<pre class="source-code"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1092.1">

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1101.1">The last thing I’ll touch on is users and permissions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1101.2">Earlier, I mentioned that every user of a Linux system gets a home directory. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1101.3">Every unique user on the system will not only have a home directory but a user account. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1101.4">Linux, and Unix, which it’s based on, is inherently a multi-user system, and it’s these user accounts – and the rights they have – that allow the system to be shared. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1101.5">No other user of the system is allowed to touch the contents of your home directory unless you specifically allow </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1102.1">them to.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1103.1">If you list the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker417"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1104.1">directory contents again using the </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1105.1">-lha</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1106.1"> option, one of the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker418"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1107.1"> things you’ll see, in the second and third column of data, is the owner of the file and the primary group name, respectively. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1107.2">The meaning of the owner of the file should be obvious: it’ll be your </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1108.1">username</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1109.1">! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1109.2">Since you created the file, you own it and you can do whatever you like with it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1109.3">However, anyone in the same user group, denoted by the third column, can also access </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1110.1">the file.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1111.1">Groups are a way users can be organized in Linux for easier administration. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1111.2">When you create the file, the group may well be the same as your username. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1111.3">That simply means that on this particular Linux system, by default, a group is created for each user, named the same as the username. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1111.4">Since no one else will be in that group, it means that the file is truly only accessible by the user. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1111.5">In a way, it means that the group is irrelevant in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1112.1">this case.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1113.1">If you want to give ownership to another user, there’s a command </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1114.1">for that:</span></span></p>
<pre class="source-code"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1115.1">
chown &lt;new_owner_username&gt; my_file</span></pre> <p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1116.1">The </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1117.1">chown</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1118.1"> command stands for change owner. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1118.2">After executing it, you will no longer be able to access the file yourself since the username specified in the command will own it (you typically wouldn’t do this in your home directory, but you </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1119.1">definitely can).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1120.1">You can’t allow a specific user the ability to edit your file, but what you can do is give anyone in the group the ability to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1121.1">do so:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1137.1">A couple of times now, I said that only you, by default, will be able to edit your file, but that’s not 100% true. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1137.2">You should also be aware that there is always a user named root on a Linux system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1137.3">This is, in a sense, the god of the machine. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1137.4">The root user can do everything at all times and the root user account is meant for the administrator(s) of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1138.1">the machine.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1139.1">However, even administrators will often log into the system as regular, non-root users, meaning they have no special privileges. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1139.2">This is an important security maxim known as the principle of least privilege. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1139.3">This means that a user should have the rights necessary to perform their </span><a id="_idIndexMarker419"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1140.1">duties, and no more. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1140.2">However, an administrator needs </span><a id="_idIndexMarker420"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1141.1">to have greater rights, so what they are allowed to do is </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1142.1">elevate</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1143.1"> their </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1144.1">privileges </span></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1145.1">temporarily</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1146.1">.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1179.1">In this chapter, we touched on several topics that are of large importance to web developers, but which aren’t explicitly about writing code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1179.2">This included SCM – primarily in the form of Git, Linux, secure coding practices, and IDEs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1179.3">You saw how SCM is a key component of your web development workflow, how IDEs can make your life a lot easier in that work, how thinking about security from the ground up when writing code is of paramount importance, and how Linux is the one operating system to rule them all, one operating system to find them, one operating system to bring them all and in the darkness bind them (sorry, I’m a geek – I couldn’t resist the cheap Lord of the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1180.1">Rings reference!).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1181.1">In the next chapter, we’ll continue looking at some things that continue the theme of this chapter – that is, topics that you’ll need to know about that may not directly be code (but of course, it’s </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1182.1">all</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1183.1"> about the code in </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1184.1">some</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1185.1"> fashion ultimately). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1185.2">This includes the famous term “the cloud,” virtual machines and containers, DevOps (whatever that is!), Python, graphic design, UX, and responsive design. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1185.3">Let’s keep pushing this boulder up the hill, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1186.1">shall we?</span></span></p>
