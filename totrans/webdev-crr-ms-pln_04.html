<h1 id="_idParaDest-106"><a id="_idTextAnchor106"/>Managing, Securing, and Working with Code</h1>
<p>Over the last two chapters, we’ve spent a fair amount of time looking at actual code and getting you acclimated to the nuts and bolts, so to speak, of web development. It should be obvious that most of your time will likely be spent “twiddling bits,” as we software nerds like to say!</p>
<p>But you’ve also seen that there is a lot more to it than just <em class="italic">writing</em> code. In this chapter, we’ll look at a few more of those “not writing code” things, including the idea of source control (how you keep track of the changes to your code), operating systems (Linux in particular), <strong class="bold">integrated development environments</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDEs</strong>) (tools that help you write code <a id="_idIndexMarker299"/>without leaving one consolidated application), security, and even one or two other languages that commonly come into play for web developers.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll touch on the following “non-code,” so to speak, topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Controlling the code – source control management systems</li>
<li>Thinking like a hacker – securing the web</li>
<li>Working all in one place – IDEs</li>
<li>Understanding the operating system – Linux</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-107"><a id="_idTextAnchor107"/>Technical requirements</h1>
<p>As in the previous chapter, I will assume you have already downloaded the source code for this book from GitHub, as outlined in the <em class="italic">Technical requirements</em> section of <a href="B18315_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor061"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>. For this chapter, we’ll again be dealing with the code in the <code>ch-03/2-spa</code> directory.</p>
<p>The other thing you’ll need to do is get Git installed. For that, head over to <a href="https://git-scm.com">https://git-scm.com</a> and find the download package appropriate for your system. I will leave this as an exercise for you, but it’s nothing unusual, so I know you can handle it.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-108"><a id="_idTextAnchor108"/>Controlling the code – source control management systems</h1>
<p>Okay; so, you’ve spent <a id="_idIndexMarker300"/>a few hours hacking code – maybe you’ve built a nifty-keen little user registration page, for example. As someone in the mafia might say: it’d be a shame if something were to happen to that code, wouldn’t it? Surely there must be a way to protect your code, and indeed, there<a id="_idIndexMarker301"/> is: <strong class="bold">source control</strong>.</p>
<p>Let me start by telling you how us old fogies used to do source control.</p>
<p>Every so often, we would create a new directory in our project directory and name it something like “HTML_complete_8-6-1991_1-30pm.” Then, we’d copy all the files from our project into it. We’d work on the project a little more, and maybe later we’d create another directory named “JS_complete_8-6-1991_4:30pm” and again copy all the project files into it.</p>
<p>Think that through for a moment. At the point I completed the HTML for the project, I essentially made a backup of the current state of all the files in my project. When the JavaScript was done, I made another copy. What I had was a history of the files in the project. Later, if I was working on the JavaScript and made a mistake and found it suddenly didn’t work, I could go back to one of those directories and compare the JavaScript to what it was when it last worked.</p>
<p>While it was ugly and completely manual, this was essentially a form of source control, or <strong class="bold">version control</strong> as it’s<a id="_idIndexMarker302"/> often called (for obvious reasons: each directory represents a past version of the code).</p>
<p>Further, we would frequently, often at the end of the day, copy all those directories onto some central server somewhere, one that was being properly backed up all the time. This provides a layer of protection: even if the hard drive in our computer were to die, we’d have a copy of our code on that server. We might lose some work if we were in the middle of coding and hadn’t created a new version directory recently, but it’s better than having lost everything. At least we could get back to the last saved version at worst.</p>
<p>It’s a good system in that it provides history and some level of protection, but being so manual means it’s very prone to errors. Plus, it’s not all that robust. For example, if we need to compare a file to a previous version, how do we do that? Back then, it was as “simple” as “putting both files on the screen side-by-side, going through them, and trying to spot the changes.” That’s not a great approach. And then there are other things you might want to do, such as keep notes alongside the code about your progress. Sure, you could create a <code>notes.txt</code> file and save it, but again, it’s a manual process, and it also varies from developer to developer since no two will likely land on the same directory naming conventions and approaches.</p>
<p>Surely there must<a id="_idIndexMarker303"/> now, literally decades later, be a better answer, right? Indeed, there is: <strong class="bold">source code </strong><strong class="bold">management</strong> (<strong class="bold">SCM</strong>).</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-109"><a id="_idTextAnchor109"/>Introducing SCM</h2>
<p>This is where SCM <a id="_idIndexMarker304"/>comes in. An SCM system, or version control system, as we say, is a piece of software that records changes to your project files over time, more or less automatically. SCM provides ways for you to review the history of your project, compare files, recall specific versions of files, attach notes to your changes, and more.</p>
<p>They also do something else that was difficult back in the ugly manual source control days: they allow multiple developers to work on the same code simultaneously. They do this by tracking the changes of each contributor and managing the process of <strong class="bold">merging</strong>. Merging is <a id="_idIndexMarker305"/>when you have two copies of a file with changes from two different people (usually – though it <em class="italic">could</em> be the same person), and you need to combine the changes into one canonical version of the file. When you’re a single developer working on a project, this is unlikely to ever come up, but it’s a crucial concern in software development when working on a team.</p>
<p>SCM is considered a foundational tool in software development, meaning that in a professional environment, you’ll virtually always be using SCM. These days, it’s even unusual for a single developer to not use SCM since there is tremendous value in being able to go back in time, so to speak, and see what a file looked like at various points in time.</p>
<p>SCM has a couple of key points to it:</p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic">Version tracking</em>: SCM keeps a history of every change made to the files in a <strong class="bold">repository</strong>, or repo for short, which is another way to describe your project directory (it’s not <em class="italic">exactly</em> the same, but conceptually, that’s the way you can think of it for now). Not only does it keep a record of the file’s contents, but it also includes who changed it and when the changes were made, and it usually includes some sort of note about the change from the developer. This helps track the progress of your project, understand how the code base is evolving, and of course gives you a way to roll back changes.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Rollback</em>: This is<a id="_idIndexMarker306"/> simply the ability to retrieve a previous version of a file if problems are found (or if you just decide that subsequent changes can be thrown away).</li>
<li><em class="italic">Collaboration</em>: Multiple developers can work on the same code base simultaneously. An SCM system manages changes from different people and merges them, allowing for collaborative work without overwriting each other’s contributions.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Branching</em>: Sometimes, developers may need to work on something that is somewhat experimental. To avoid such experiments messing up the existing presumably good code, they can create a branch, which effectively is a copy of the project at the time the branch is created. The developer then does their work, saving their changes to that branch, all the while not touching the good code. Eventually, if the experiment proves fruitful, it can be merged into the good code, making it a permanent part of the main project code.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Conflict resolution</em>: When two copies of a file are merged, they may sometimes conflict – for example, if two developers change the same line of code. When that happens, the SCM can alert the developer attempting to merge the code that there is a conflict that they need to manually resolve (which usually means deciding which file the change should come from), and then completing the merge.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Safety</em>: SCM serves as a backup, of sorts. If project files become corrupt, they can be retrieved<a id="_idIndexMarker307"/> from the SCM system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you know what SCM is, let’s talk about the options you have in SCM systems.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-110"><a id="_idTextAnchor110"/>Accepting the false choice – Git it is!</h2>
<p>Look, I’m just<a id="_idIndexMarker308"/> going to cut to<a id="_idIndexMarker309"/> the chase here: you almost don’t have a choice in what SCM system to use nowadays, it’s gonna be something called Git.</p>
<p>There are several SCM systems out there; names such as Mercurial, CVS, Subversion, Bitbucket, and Perforce are ones you may have heard of. But the simple truth is that the industry has almost entirely coalesced around Git, created by the same person who created the Linux operating system: Linus Torvalds. Git was built in 2005 specifically for those working on the Linux kernel to be able to collaborate more easily.</p>
<p>Git is somewhat unique from many other SCM systems in that it is <em class="italic">distributed</em>. What this means is that every developer has a copy of an entire Git repository, including a full history of all changes. This is unusual in that most other SCMs are <em class="italic">centralized</em>, meaning there is one canonical copy of the code, plus all the history that goes along with it, and developers only get copies of the code on their machines to work on, and never the full history. The benefit of a distributed SCM is that they do not require a network connection to a central server all the time as a centralized SCM does (though it’s important to note that in <em class="italic">most</em> cases, even when you use Git, there <em class="italic">is</em> a centralized copy – it’s just that you don’t need to be constantly connected to it with Git like with other SCM systems).</p>
<p>Git became popular for many reasons, but one of the big ones is speed and performance. With other SCMs, merging changes can sometimes take a fair bit of time. We’re not talking about hours here, but even a few seconds add up throughout a workday. Git is very optimized for speed from the ground up and most operations happen almost instantly. One of the key ways in which Git’s performance won over most developers is when it comes to branching. The way Git does branching is fundamentally different from most other SCM systems and is far more lightweight. While creating a branch in Subversion, for example, may take several seconds or even minutes if the content you’re branching from is large enough, with Git, it’s practically instant, no matter the size of the content.</p>
<p>Because Git gained a lot of popularity very quickly – and at this point, it is the de facto standard SCM in the software development world – everyone started integrating it into other tools, So, now, today, you can work with Git in practically every bit of developer tooling out there, some of which we’ll get to later in this chapter. It has a very large community and support system, so any time you run into problems with Git, you’ll have no problem getting help.</p>
<p>Git can be (relatively) simply used from the command line, and many developers will tell you that this is <a id="_idIndexMarker310"/>the <em class="italic">best</em> way to use<a id="_idIndexMarker311"/> Git. I’m not one of those developers. But I do think it’s where you should <em class="italic">start</em>, so that’s exactly what we’ll do now!</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-111"><a id="_idTextAnchor111"/>Getting started with Git</h2>
<p>What we’re <a id="_idIndexMarker312"/>going to do here is add source control <a id="_idIndexMarker313"/>to the project from the previous chapter (more specifically, the SPA version in the <code>ch-03/2-spa</code> directory of the source code download you should already have by now). This allows you to begin making changes to the code and allows Git to track and manage those changes for you, providing you with all the benefits that SCM confers (such as being able to go back to previous versions later).</p>
<p>What you’ll want to do is start by making a copy of the project directory. Then, look for a <code>.git</code> directory inside of it:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you find it, go ahead and delete it</li>
<li>If you don’t see it, that’s okay – you’re good to go</li>
</ul>
<p>This directory is one that Git creates to store information it needs to do its job. If you got the source code for this book from GitHub, then it may have that directory. However, since what we’re going to do here will cause that directory to be created, you’ll want to make sure you start from a clean slate with no <code>.git</code> directory present.</p>
<p>Once that’s done, go to a command prompt and enter this command:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
git –-version</pre> <p>Press <em class="italic">Enter</em> and ensure you get a response similar to <code>git version 2.42.0.windows.2</code> (the version may differ, and it won’t say <code>windows</code> if you’re on Mac or Linux, but you get the idea). So long as this happens, you’re good to go with Git.</p>
<p>At this point, navigate <a id="_idIndexMarker314"/>to the copy of the project <a id="_idIndexMarker315"/>directory you created, and let’s get this thing under source control!</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-112"><a id="_idTextAnchor112"/>Using the most common Git commands</h2>
<p>Working with<a id="_idIndexMarker316"/> Git at <a id="_idIndexMarker317"/>a basic level – which most days is all you need – isn’t too tough and boils down to maybe a dozen common commands. Let’s run through those now by using one of the project directories from the previous chapter – let’s say the <code>ch-03/2-spa</code> one. Launch a command prompt and navigate to that directory now.</p>
<h3>Setting up a new repository (or cloning an existing repository)</h3>
<p>To set up a new<a id="_idIndexMarker318"/> repository, the first step is to tell Git that you want the current directory to be a Git repository:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
git init</pre> <p>You should see something like what’s shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4</em><em class="italic">.1</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 4.1: Initializing a Git repo" src="img/B18315_04_1.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.1: Initializing a Git repo</p>
<p>Note that after executing the <code>git init</code> command, I listed the directory, but there was no <code>.git</code> directory <a id="_idIndexMarker319"/>visible, a directory that Git creates to store all its metadata about your repo. That’s because it’s hidden. So, to see it, you must execute <code>dir /a</code>. That confirms that Git did its thing, and we now have ourselves a repo.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note for Linux and Mac users</p>
<p class="callout">Throughout this book, because I am primarily a Windows user, I’ve written it largely Windows-centric. In most cases, what you would see and do on a Linux or Mac machine will be the same. But, in a few cases, things are different between Windows and Linux or Mac. An example is that while <code>dir /a</code> works in Windows, under Linux or Mac, you would instead use <code>ls -a</code>.</p>
<p>Of course, you may not always be starting a project and thus a repository. If you are starting work on someone else’s project, you would most likely do what’s called <strong class="bold">cloning</strong> their<a id="_idIndexMarker320"/> repo. This means copying their repo to your local machine. To do that, you use this command instead:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
git clone &lt;url&gt;</pre> <p>This gives you the same result as initializing a repo: the current directory becomes a Git repo, with a hidden <code>.</code><code>git</code> directory.</p>
<p>The main difference between initializing and cloning an existing repo is that cloning also causes all the files in the repo to be copied into the current directory. However, when you start with an <a id="_idIndexMarker321"/>empty repo after initializing one, there are no files in the repo (even though they may be physically in the directory – Git isn’t aware of them yet though).</p>
<h3>Adding files</h3>
<p>Just creating a <a id="_idIndexMarker322"/>repo doesn’t do all that much. At this point, Git isn’t even aware of any of the files that are in the directory, or any you may add later. You have to tell Git about each file you want it to track. To do this, you can use the <code>git </code><code>add</code> command:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
git add &lt;file&gt;</pre> <p>For example, in our project, there should currently be four files: <code>index.html</code>, <code>index.js</code>, <code>package.json</code>, and <code>styles.css</code>. So, execute a <code>git add</code> command for each and execute the following four commands:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
git add index.html
git add index.js
git add package.json
git add styles.css</pre> <p>Also, just as an example of what happens if you use an incorrect name, enter this command as well:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
git add badName.txt</pre> <p>The output should be like that shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4</em><em class="italic">.2</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 4.2: Adding the files from our project, plus a mistake!" src="img/B18315_04_2.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.2: Adding the files from our project, plus a mistake!</p>
<p>As you can see, I also attempted to add a file that doesn’t exist, and you can see that Git alerts us to that fact. Also, note the warning Git provides for the <code>package.json</code> file. You may not get this depending on your operating system, and either way, it shouldn’t make much difference to us, but it’s nice of Git to let us know what it’ll do.</p>
<p>In general, getting no error or warning means the command is successful. That’s a common pattern with Linux commands that you’ll want to keep in mind. Git is intrinsically tied to<a id="_idIndexMarker323"/> Linux development, as discussed earlier, so it makes sense that it would work this way.</p>
<h3>Checking status</h3>
<p>To make sure <a id="_idIndexMarker324"/>Git is now aware of our files, we can ask it for the current status:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
git status</pre> <p>This command shows the status of changes. In <em class="italic">Figure 4</em><em class="italic">.3</em>, you can see that all four files are <strong class="bold">to be committed</strong>. This means they are in a special area of the Git repo called the <strong class="bold">staging area</strong>. Simply<a id="_idIndexMarker325"/> put, this is where changes that Git is aware of, but which haven’t yet been committed – meaning made a permanent part of the repo – are stored:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 4.3: The status, including what’s in the staging area" src="img/B18315_04_3.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.3: The status, including what’s in the staging area</p>
<h3>Committing changes</h3>
<p>How do we move <a id="_idIndexMarker326"/>the changes from the staging area into the repo itself? That’s easy: we commit them!</p>
<p>Committing changes can be done with the <code>git </code><code>commit</code> command:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
git commit -m "&lt;commit message&gt;"</pre> <p>You must provide a message to go along with the commit, which should be some meaningful description of what the changes are. If you’re working on a new feature and this code implements it, then you’ll want to say something like “These changes implement the <em class="italic">X</em> change.” But it’s up to you – whatever makes sense. You might enter something like this, which I think is a sensible enough message:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
git commit -m "Adding initial files to repo"</pre> <p>In <em class="italic">Figure 4</em><em class="italic">.4</em>, you can see the result of that command:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 4.4: Committing our project files to the repo" src="img/B18315_04_4.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.4: Committing our project files to the repo</p>
<p>You can also see that I executed <code>git status</code> again, and now there are no files in the staging area, as<a id="_idIndexMarker327"/> expected.</p>
<h3>Viewing the commit history</h3>
<p>To see a list of the <a id="_idIndexMarker328"/>commits that have occurred in your repo, execute the <code>git </code><code>log</code> command:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
git log</pre> <p>This command shows the chronological commit history for the current branch. I’ll talk about branches shortly, but for now, you just need to know that Git creates a <code>master</code> branch by default, and unless you tell it otherwise, that’s where all your work will go. Note that <code>master</code> is sometimes named <code>main</code>, depending on what version of Git you’re using or what tools might be in play on top of Git. Whichever name you see, it means the same thing.</p>
<p>In <em class="italic">Figure 4</em><em class="italic">.5</em>, you can see what the output of this command looks like:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 4.5: The git log command in action" src="img/B18315_04_5.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.5: The git log command in action</p>
<p>But what if you want to see what files were changed? By default, <code>git log</code> will just list the commits that occurred, along with the messages, date/time, and who committed it. But this is where another command, <code>git show</code>, comes into play. In <em class="italic">Figure 4</em><em class="italic">.5</em>, I execute it after the <code>git log</code> command, and there it shows me the list of files that were added to the repo as part of that commit. If you drop the <code>–name-only</code> option, it will show you the contents of each of those files too, along with what changed in them as part of that commit (obviously, when adding files as we did here, the <em class="italic">entire file</em> changed as far as Git was concerned, changed from not being in the repo to being in the repo).</p>
<p>By the way, what’s that <code>e0b60a5e</code> thing after the <code>–name-only</code> option? That’s a hash, which in this context is a unique identifier associated with the commit. More precisely, it’s the first 8 characters of the hash – you can see the full hash displayed after the word <code>commit</code> in the <code>git log</code> and <code>git show</code> output. 8 characters are nearly always all you need to guarantee Git can find the unique hash (the reasons for that gets deep into cryptography and advanced mathematics, so you have to just take it on faith that it’s almost <a id="_idIndexMarker329"/>impossible for a hash for two commits to be the same), and it’s all we need to enter (though you <em class="italic">can</em> put the full hash if you’re masochistic!)</p>
<h3>Removing files and restoring removed files</h3>
<p>If you can <a id="_idIndexMarker330"/>add files to a Git repo, then surely you can also remove <a id="_idIndexMarker331"/>them, and indeed you can! To remove a file, Git provides the <code>rm</code> command:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
git rm &lt;file&gt;</pre> <p>As with adding a file, <code>git rm</code> only affects the staging area. To remove the file, you need to execute <code>git commit</code> again to make the change permanent in the repo.</p>
<p>But rather than just doing that, I want to show you something else important: restoring deleted files. In <em class="italic">Figure 4</em><em class="italic">.6</em>, I’ve deleted a file, but I’ve done a bit more after that as well (note that you should read this top to bottom, left to right, as this is all one continuous flow of events, but I had to split the screen capture in half to fit it all here):</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 4.6: Deleting and restoring a file" src="img/B18315_04_6.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.6: Deleting and restoring a file</p>
<p>First, I listed the directory to see the files. Next, I executed the <code>git status</code> command to ensure there were no staged changes. After that, I removed the <code>styles.css</code> file with <code>git rm styles.css</code>, immediately listed the directory to confirm it was deleted, and then executed the <code>git status</code> command again to see that it was marked as deleted. At this point, the deletion is <em class="italic">staged</em>, but it hasn’t been permanently deleted from the repo yet.</p>
<p>Given that fact, there’s still time to save the file! First, we need to tell Git to ignore the deletion in the staging area. That’s done with the following command:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
git restore –-staged &lt;file&gt;</pre> <p>However, when you list the directory again, you will find that the file still isn’t present. We have to tell Git to physically restore the file now because the previous command only told it that we no longer want to delete it. So, executing the following command does the trick:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
git restore &lt;file&gt;</pre> <p>But you can’t execute that until you execute the previous command with <code>–-staged</code> as an option. Git can get a little confusing at times to be sure, and most of that confusion comes about because of this sort of dual-commit procedure: first, you tell Git what changes you want to make (you stage them) and then you make the changes to the repo (you commit them).</p>
<p>Even if you commit<a id="_idIndexMarker332"/> the<a id="_idIndexMarker333"/> deletion, there are still ways to get the file back. You would have to use the <code>git log</code> command to look back through the history, find the version you want, and then use another command to restore it:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
git checkout &lt;commit hash&gt;</pre> <p>This will bring the file back into your project, at which point you can re-commit it if you wish.</p>
<h3>Creating a branch</h3>
<p>When you work in<a id="_idIndexMarker334"/> Git, you will sometimes want to work on some code that may or may not ultimately make it into your repo. Maybe you’re experimenting and don’t want to risk messing up your good, working code. In such cases, you can create a new <em class="italic">branch</em>, which you can think of as a completely separate copy of all of your code in the repo. You give a branch a name, and by doing that, you can then switch between branches, which alters where your changes get stored (or in other words, which copy of the code is affected). Changes to one branch (copy of your code) won’t affect any other branch unless you specifically tell Git you want them to.</p>
<p>To create a branch, use this command:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
git branch &lt;branch name&gt;</pre> <p>This creates a new branch, leaving your <code>master</code> branch (the one Git creates and uses by default) just<a id="_idIndexMarker335"/> as it is. At this point, the branch is a copy of the branch you were working in before. This is <code>master</code> in our case since that’s the only branch we had.</p>
<h3>Switching branches</h3>
<p>To ensure your <a id="_idIndexMarker336"/>changes go into the new branch, you must switch to it. You can switch to a branch at any point with a simple command:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
git checkout &lt;branch name&gt;</pre> <p>Now, any files you add and commit will go into the named branch. Any other branch, including <code>master</code>, will be unaffected. So, you can feel free to experiment all you like, assured that your previous code is safe and sound.</p>
<h3>Merging</h3>
<p>Eventually, though, you’ll<a id="_idIndexMarker337"/> likely want the code from your experimental branch to be in your <code>master</code> branch, once you get it working right. That’s where merging comes in. Merging simply means taking changes from one place and putting them in another. In the case of Git, those places are branches.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re working in a branch you named <code>experiment</code>. You worked on that code for a while, got it working, and now you want to bring those changes into your <code>master</code> branch. You would first switch to the <code>master</code> branch, then execute this command:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
git merge &lt;branch&gt;</pre> <p>Assuming <code>&lt;branch&gt;</code> was <code>experiment</code>, the changes from that branch will be merged into <code>master</code>. New files will be copied in, deleted files will be removed, and changes to existing files will be made in <code>master</code>. In the end, everything that was in the <code>experiment</code> branch, including all the history associated with all the commits you may have done, will be in <code>master</code> now too.</p>
<p>If you wish, you can now delete the <code>experiment</code> branch since you no longer need it:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
git branch -d experiment</pre> <p>To be clear, while branching isn’t what I’d call an advanced topic – because it <em class="italic">is</em> pretty common – it is an entirely <em class="italic">optional</em> topic in that you never <em class="italic">have</em> to use branches. That’s why I haven’t shown examples of these commands – you can get into them if and when you need to.</p>
<p>When using Git, developers tend to adopt a specific <em class="italic">workflow</em>, meaning how they interact with Git and progress their work. And while some Git workflows heavily emphasize branching, others actively seek to avoid them. Some workflows dictate that <em class="italic">all</em> work should be done in small “feature” branches and then merged into <code>master</code>. Others say that work should be done in <code>master</code>, but then that each release should result in a new branch from <code>master</code>. Still, others say that <code>master</code> should be the only branch at all times and that <strong class="bold">tags</strong> – a Git feature that conceptually allows you to create a named copy of the repo at a given moment in time – is the way to go.</p>
<p>In any case, so long as you know what branches are – which you now do! – you should be prepared to deal with whatever workflow you encounter. And, when it’s just you working on a project, feel free to implement any workflow you like, or keep it simple and only deal with <code>master</code> at all<a id="_idIndexMarker338"/> times. You’ll still get the benefits of version control either way.</p>
<p>The last topic we need to discuss has to do with when you’re working with a remote repo.</p>
<h3>Pushing and pulling changes</h3>
<p>So far, you’ve only <a id="_idIndexMarker339"/>been dealing with a local repo, meaning it’s right there on your machine. This is good because it provides SCM and version tracking, but it doesn’t let others work on your code with you, nor does it protect you from hardware failures on your machine. To deal with both issues, you will often deal with a remote repo.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, a remote repo is no different than a local repo, it’s just that it’s accessible over a network. If you’ve been following along, then to some extent, you’ve already dealt with a remote repo when you grabbed a copy of the code for this book from GitHub. But you very likely only download a copy of the files in the repo, and it effectively is no longer a Git repo (if there’s no hidden <code>.git</code> directory, then that’s the case).</p>
<p>When you work with a remote repo, whether you create it yourself or clone someone else’s, you have two new concepts to consider: pushing and pulling.</p>
<p>When you commit changes to your local repo, even if it’s a copy of someone else’s remote repo, it only affects your local copy. To get your committed changes into the remote repo, you must <em class="italic">push</em> the changes to it:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
git push &lt;remote&gt; &lt;branch&gt;</pre> <p>This command sends your committed changes to a remote repository. The <code>remote</code> value is the name of the remote repo, which more times than not will be the origin. The <code>branch</code> value is the branch from your local repo that you want to push changes from.</p>
<p>That’s good, but what about getting new changes from the remote repo? To get changes from the remote repo, you <em class="italic">pull</em> them:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
git pull &lt;remote&gt; &lt;branch&gt;</pre> <p>This command fetches and merges changes on the remote server to your working directory. As with push, the <code>remote</code> value will most often be the origin, and <code>branch</code> is what local branch in your repo you want the changes merged into.</p>
<p>With just these two commands, you can interact with a remote repository, allowing you and others to work on the code simultaneously. But where will that remote repo live? There are many options, including<a id="_idIndexMarker340"/> hosting it yourself, but one of the most popular is one you’ve already met: GitHub!</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-113"><a id="_idTextAnchor113"/>GitHub – Git, but nice</h2>
<p><strong class="bold">GitHub</strong> is to Git as<a id="_idIndexMarker341"/> a computer is to electricity. While it is the electricity – and Git – that do the <a id="_idIndexMarker342"/>actual work, you would probably prefer the experience of interacting with a computer – and GitHub! As you saw in the previous section, you can work with Git on a command line, but you may have noticed it isn’t the most pleasant experience. And believe me when I say that you’ve only seen the basics… it gets worse!</p>
<p>But GitHub seeks to solve that problem by providing a much more user-friendly way to work with Git. GitHub, as you presumably saw when you accessed the code for this book, is a web-based platform where developers store and manage their projects, and optionally make them available to the world. It’s built on top of Git, and while Git handles the nitty-gritty of tracking changes to files in a project, GitHub provides a user-friendly interface to work with it, plus a lot of extra features, such as bug tracking, task management, social networking features for developers, and even hosting of projects such as websites (<strong class="bold">GitHub Pages</strong>, as it’s<a id="_idIndexMarker343"/> called). Think of Git as the engine under the hood, and GitHub as the car built around it, offering a more comfortable and feature-rich ride than the engine alone would (boy, the visual image of someone riding a car engine down the road is something, isn’t it?).</p>
<p>GitHub allows you to clone a repo, work on it locally, and then push changes to it (subject to privileges to do so, one of the added features it puts on top of Git). GitHub also offers <strong class="bold">Actions</strong>, which are bits of code the owner of a repo can set up to execute when various events occur. For example, there may be an Action to build the project whenever someone pushes to the repo, and then deploy a new version of the project, say a website, where it can be accessed by all.</p>
<p>GitHub adds an issue tracker to repos so that users of your project can submit bug reports and you can track and manage progress on their resolution.</p>
<p>GitHub provides an online code editing platform too, so you could work on a project entirely on GitHub itself if you wanted to. Many developers like their tools to be local on their machines, and<a id="_idIndexMarker344"/> they use GitHub as just a remote repository, but it can do a lot<a id="_idIndexMarker345"/> more if you so choose.</p>
<p>GitHub even offers AI in the form of CoPilot. This is a feature that can provide real-time coding suggestions as you type, saving you time and maybe even solutions to problems you would have otherwise gotten stuck on. It does this by training the AI on repos in GitHub, so you in effect get the combined knowledge, wisdom, and experience of everyone else using GitHub.</p>
<p>I could go on because GitHub is more than just a host of Git repos – it’s more like a central hub for developers to do their work. But the great thing about it is that you can dip a toe in at the start and then jump in completely later, or leave just the toe in. It’s entirely up to you how far into GitHub you go. And I should point out that there are alternatives to GitHub. But the simple truth is that GitHub is pretty much king. It is used by far more developers than any competitor out there. You’ll almost certainly deal with GitHub in some fashion as you continue your web developer journey, it’s just a question of to what extent.</p>
<p>I assume that you’ve downloaded the code for this book, which means you’ve already created a GitHub account. But if you haven’t, now is the time! Either way, I strongly suggest spending some time playing around on GitHub. I would suggest creating a repo, adding a file or two, and editing them, all on GitHub itself. Then, practice cloning the repo onto your local machine, edit and add files again, and then push to GitHub and see how the changes show up there. I think you’ll quickly see the value in GitHub and appreciate how it smooths some of the rough edges of Git in the process.</p>
<p>Now that you have an<a id="_idIndexMarker346"/> idea<a id="_idIndexMarker347"/> of how to manage source code with Git, let’s talk about a different topic, one that every developer has to keep in mind at all times as they code: security.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-114"><a id="_idTextAnchor114"/>Thinking like a hacker – securing the web</h1>
<p>Creating secure <a id="_idIndexMarker348"/>websites takes a lot of time, effort, and attention to detail across several layers. “Security-in-depth” is a common phrase that means you don’t just lock the door – you also have a security camera, a guard dog, and bars on the windows to keep your home safe. In the same way, writing secure code is part of it, as is ensuring your servers are “hardened” against attacks. This is an extremely expansive topic, and it has only grown in importance over the years. We’ve all certainly seen all the security breaches that have happened in recent years, and most of us have probably been personally impacted in some way. Unfortunately, this stuff ain’t easy to get right.</p>
<p>But it all starts with writing secure code, and to do that, you must have some knowledge of the types of things hackers – or <em class="italic">threat actors</em>, as we call them in professional circles – look for in your code to exploit. Well, they usually aren’t looking at your code per se; they’re looking at your website, trying to infer how your code is written, and then looking for weaknesses in it.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-115"><a id="_idTextAnchor115"/>Common exploits</h2>
<p>The good news is that <a id="_idIndexMarker349"/>these days, exploits – weaknesses that a hacker can use to breach your security – by and large fall into a few broad categories.</p>
<h3>SQL injection</h3>
<p>Without knowing <a id="_idIndexMarker350"/>what SQL is, this one is hard to explain. But, to<a id="_idIndexMarker351"/> give you the crib notes version… SQL is a special language that allows you to get data out of a database. For example, if your database contains a list of checking accounts, you might get a list of them by executing the <code>select * from checking_accounts</code> SQL statement.</p>
<p>A <strong class="bold">SQL injection</strong> attack works on the premise of such statements in conjunction with the fact that developers don’t always code them safely. When they don’t, it allows a threat actor to modify those statements through clever values in forms. By doing so, they are then able to access data they shouldn’t be able to. Thankfully, this is an easy problem to avoid: it just requires developers to write code that uses SQL statements in a specific way.</p>
<h3>Cross-site scripting (XSS)</h3>
<p>XSS is a technique <a id="_idIndexMarker352"/>threat actors use<a id="_idIndexMarker353"/> that allows them to inject malicious scripts (we’re talking about JavaScript here) into content viewed by other users, potentially stealing data, or impersonating users. This exploit is a great example of why security is so difficult: you may be thinking that this requires someone to be able to access your server to modify your code, but that’s not the case. Instead, clever usage of things such as email, where it’s often possible to embed links and other web content, allows someone to embed their malicious script, which can then launch a web browser to your legitimate site, with that script then able to do its dirty work as if it was part of your website.</p>
<p>The main point here is that threat actors will often attack your website <em class="italic">indirectly</em>, in ways that won’t even initially make sense to you because they do things in ways that you never normally would. “Thinking like a hacker” requires you to have a good understanding of how things work on the web to then be able to connect things in ways they were never intended to get to an exploit, and sometimes, those connected things may be several steps removed from the target of the attack.</p>
<p>You can take steps to remove potentially dangerous content from anything sent to the server, and you can encode output in special ways so that even if something slips through, it won’t have the desired effect when it gets to the user’s browser. For example, when taking in data from the user, you can look for any instances of JavaScript keywords and strip them out, because that’s rarely something you want to allow in user input. You would need to do this on the server side to be safe, so you would run all user input through a cleansing function that looks for those keywords, or other potentially problematic strings such as <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>, and remove them. You would also want to do the same thing on the output side, meaning any data you send to the browser should similarly be cleansed just in case something slipped into your data through another means, such as a data load to your database (when this happens, it’s called a stored XSS attack because the malicious content somehow got stored and might have an effect when returned<a id="_idIndexMarker354"/> to<a id="_idIndexMarker355"/> the browser).</p>
<h3>Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)</h3>
<p>CSRF is a way<a id="_idIndexMarker356"/> to trick a user’s browser<a id="_idIndexMarker357"/> into executing some unwanted action and it appearing to be a legitimate action from the user. This comes in several forms, with one of the more common ways being when a website uses a cookie – small pieces of information stored on a user’s browser – to identify that user. If someone can steal that cookie, they can effectively impersonate the legitimate user. Imagine stealing the cookie for a user’s banking site – a threat actor could transfer all the money out before the real user is aware of it.</p>
<p>Stealing cookies isn’t always as hard as it sounds if certain precautions aren’t taken (cookies have various security settings that developers should set properly to make them much more difficult to steal). Usage of a CSRF token is also common, which is a unique, random string that changes with each request. This way, even if someone steals your cookies, without the CSRF token, they wouldn’t be able to do anything. Other variations of CSRF require other mitigations, but it’s situation-specific.</p>
<p>In addition to defenses for specific exploits like these, there are some basic coding practices you can use to help avoid security issues.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-116"><a id="_idTextAnchor116"/>Secure coding practices</h2>
<p>As you write code, you<a id="_idIndexMarker358"/> should keep a few key things in mind. Doing so will help you avoid not only the previously mentioned issues but a whole lot more.</p>
<h3>Implement secure authentication</h3>
<p>You should always <a id="_idIndexMarker359"/>implement strong password policies and use <strong class="bold">multi-factor authentication</strong> (<strong class="bold">MFA</strong>) to <a id="_idIndexMarker360"/>protect user accounts where possible. MFA means that a user must prove themselves through more than one factor, where a factor is something you are, something you know, and something you have. For example, logging into a site may require a username (who you are) a password (what you know), and perhaps a one-time code sent to your phone (something you have). While a threat actor managing to steal your password can happen (and your username isn’t generally considered sensitive in the first place), it’s unlikely they would also have your cell phone, so by requiring multiple factors, you’ve now defended that website.</p>
<h3>Use encryption</h3>
<p>Unless you have <a id="_idIndexMarker361"/>a very good reason not to, you should always use HTTPS so that the data that is transmitted between a browser and a server is encrypted. (The only good reason I can think of not to use HTTPS nowadays is when working on your machine during development since there is more configuration involved to use HTTPS than plain old HTTP that you simply may not want to deal with during development.)</p>
<p>This avoids a form of attack<a id="_idIndexMarker362"/> called <strong class="bold">Man-in-the-Middle</strong> (<strong class="bold">MITM</strong>). In such an attack, a threat actor might gain control of a router on the network that your data passes through when sent to the server. In that situation, they can view that data, which may well include your username and password, and if you don’t have MFA, they can then log in as you all they want. Encryption makes it so that all they’ll ever see is a stream of gibberish.</p>
<h3>Handle errors properly</h3>
<p>When you write <a id="_idIndexMarker363"/>code, almost every language has ways that you can handle error conditions. This is important because when such errors occur, they can leak information about the underlying architecture of your website, or even allow a threat actor to sneak snippets of code that can then be executed in the context of your code. To avoid this, you should always ensure that error messages displayed to users give as little information as possible about your technology stack, and you should always try to use the error handling mechanisms your language of choice provides so that nothing can “slip out,” so to speak, that a threat actor can use against you.</p>
<h3>Perform code reviews and do robust testing</h3>
<p>Regularly review <a id="_idIndexMarker364"/>code for vulnerabilities <a id="_idIndexMarker365"/>and perform security testing, including penetration testing and static code analysis.</p>
<p>Static code analysis tools look at your code without executing it and look for patterns that frequently denote security concerns. Static analysis can uncover other problems, not just security problems. It can find logic flaws that might result in bugs and can point out places where your code isn’t written to acceptable standards.</p>
<p>Penetration testing, usually abbreviated as pen testing, involves people (known as “white hat” hackers) actively trying to hack your website – with your approval, of course! They, try to find ways past your security by, for example, looking for clues about what technology you’re using and then searching for known vulnerabilities. They can also look for flaws in your code, based just on how it works, that allows them to breach your security.</p>
<p>Both of these are valuable because they point out things you may have missed yourself that you can then correct. Being proactive like this allows you to remediate these findings before the bad guys get in there and do bad guys things!</p>
<h3>Implement the principle of least privilege</h3>
<p>This is typically more<a id="_idIndexMarker366"/> at the operating system level than the code level, but sometimes, it does leak into the code level. Regardless, the idea is that you should only grant the permissions necessary to perform a task to a given user, reducing the potential impact of a breach if one should occur. Remember when we discussed the root user in Linux earlier? Well, if a threat actor can gain access as the root user, they have the keys to the kingdom – they can do anything. However, if they can only get into your server as a user who has limited access rights to files and directories, then even though they’ve breached your security, the damage they can do is limited.</p>
<h3>Set security headers</h3>
<p>Servers can set <a id="_idIndexMarker367"/>various headers on responses to browsers that <a id="_idIndexMarker368"/>are called <strong class="bold">content security policy</strong> (<strong class="bold">CSP</strong>) headers, as well as X-Frame-Options and Strict-Transport-Security headers. These tell the browser what they are allowed to do with the content the server returns. Properly configuring these headers can limit what a threat actor can do on your website, in some cases eliminating certain classes of exploits entirely (well, “entirely” is never a good thing to say when it comes to web security, but it certainly makes it much more challenging for the bad guys, which is essentially the overall goal to all of this – make it so difficult that it<a id="_idIndexMarker369"/> isn’t worth their time basically).</p>
<h3>Do regular updates</h3>
<p>You should almost<a id="_idIndexMarker370"/> always use the latest versions of things such as languages, libraries, and server software because they tend to have been patched against previously discovered security problems. New ones can always be discovered, so this is something that is an ongoing task.</p>
<h3>Validate input</h3>
<p>When you get<a id="_idIndexMarker371"/> data from a client, you must always assume it contains security exploits. From the perspective of the server, a client is never to be trusted! So, we do things such as sanitizing input data, which means ensuring that all input data meets specific criteria to prevent malformed data from entering the system, this could lead to exploits. For example, if you have a form field that is for entering the user’s age, that’s intended to be a number. And, even if you have JavaScript on the page that ensures that’s the case, a threat actor has other ways to make that data not be a number. When the server gets it, if it assumes it’s a number – if it assumes the client is trusted – then non-numeric data can slip in, and there might be a way to use that to a threat actor’s benefit. Therefore, your server code <em class="italic">must</em> validate that what the client sent <em class="italic">is</em> a number as expected. Never, ever, ever trust the client! If you remember nothing else from this entire section, remember this, because it alone will help you avoid many, if not most, security exploits out there.</p>
<h3>Encode output</h3>
<p>Imagine that you<a id="_idIndexMarker372"/> have a website that gets stock ticker values from a remote service. Further, imagine that you store that data in your database and show it to your users. Now, your website might be perfectly coded, so it sanitizes all the data it gets from the user. Hooray! But what about the data you get from that remote service? Did <em class="italic">they</em> do <em class="italic">their</em> job as well as <em class="italic">you</em> did? Maybe not!</p>
<p>In that case, you may wind up with malicious content in the form of JavaScript code stored in your database, and then when you render that JavaScript on your page, it can execute within the context of your page as if you had written it yourself, but doing the bidding of the bad guys. This is called a stored CSS attack because the malicious code was stored somewhere and snuck in “through the back door,” so to speak. To avoid this, you need to encode the data that is sent to your clients, removing certain content that can lead to exploits.</p>
<p>How this encoding is implemented varies greatly depending on many factors – far too many to detail here. But generally, it involves replacing certain characters or sequences of characters with others that are considered safe. Just as one example, if a user can submit data that contains the text <code>alert(1)</code> and it is saved in your database and is then later used on your page, that JavaScript code will execute as if you wrote it yourself. To deal with <a id="_idIndexMarker373"/>that, you may need to encode the <code>(</code> and <code>)</code> characters as  <code>&amp;#40;</code> and <code>&amp;#41;</code>, respectively, which are special sequences that will ensure the code isn’t executed.</p>
<h3>Securely manage configuration</h3>
<p>It is common to need<a id="_idIndexMarker374"/> certain pieces of sensitive information in your code. For example, your code may need a username and password to connect to a database. If you embed this information in your code, then anyone who manages to see the code now has those credentials. This can be avoided by securely storing those credentials, usually in some special system specialized and designed for such sensitive information. Your code will then request the credentials from that system only when needed, and then they are only ever stored in the server’s memory for a short period.</p>
<h3>Monitor file uploads</h3>
<p>If your application<a id="_idIndexMarker375"/> allows file uploads, ensure that they are scanned for malware and have strict controls on the types and sizes of files. If you are building a website where people can show others their photo albums, for example, you’ll want to implement code that ensures only graphics files are uploaded. Plus, you will probably want to have code that ensures no file greater than maybe 10 Mb is uploaded. This way, you can stop users from uploading, say, large executable files that could be malware through which to attack your server.</p>
<h3>Secure data storage properly</h3>
<p>Something that<a id="_idIndexMarker376"/> comes up often is needing to store user credentials – usernames and passwords, most typically. You may think that storing them in a database on your server is safe, but that isn’t the case. Someone may be able to gain access to that database. And if you store it in a file instead of a database, then the same may be true.</p>
<p>No, you have to store that data securely. How would you do so in this case? You may think that you can encrypt the password and store that, right? <strong class="bold">Encryption</strong> is when we take a value <a id="_idIndexMarker377"/>and generate another value that looks like gibberish, but where that gibberish can be used to reproduce the original value given another value – the key – that was used to encrypt it. In other words, encryption is a two-way function: one way encrypts some data given a key value and the other way de-crypts it (turns it back into the original data) given the key.</p>
<p>That seems safe, right? Even if someone gets your database, they’ll just see gibberish for the password (the username doesn’t typically need to be protected in any way). That’s true… unless they also get your encryption key! And that may not be very hard considering your code has to have the key to decrypt the password and see if what the user entered is correct.</p>
<p>Instead, what you should do in this case is hash the password. Unlike encryption, which is two-way, <code>abc123</code> (not a good password, but work with me here!). If we hash that password, we might get a hash value of <code>z9x8</code>. So, we can never take <code>z9x8</code> and get <code>abc123</code> from it, but we’ll always get <code>z9x8</code> if we feed the hash function <code>abc123</code>.</p>
<p>This is useful because if we store <code>z9x8</code> in our database, it means that even if someone steals it, they can never get the real password. But our server code can still validate that user! All it has to do is take the password they enter when logging in and hash it. If the has value we get matches the hash value stored in the database, then we know they entered the right password.</p>
<p>The difference between hashing and encrypting is something that developers often get wrong in my experience, and this scenario is a common one where knowing the difference is the difference between a secure login system versus one that isn’t.</p>
<p>By incorporating these (and other) practices, web developers can significantly reduce the attack surface – all the different paths through your security a threat actor might exploit – of web applications and defend against the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">More on hashing</p>
<p class="callout">Hashes aren’t just for passwords and security. You saw them used earlier when discussing Git. Hashes there work the same way – the content of a commit is run through a hash function to generate the hash value – but in Git, it’s used not for security but for uniquely identifying a commit since a hash value would be unique to the content that was committed given that there is no other combination of characters that could result in the same hash value (strictly speaking, this isn’t 100% true, but the odds of two different input strings producing the same hash value – something we call a hash collision – is statistically so unlikely that we can say it’s true).</p>
<p>Now, let’s switch<a id="_idIndexMarker379"/> gears a bit and talk about what in many cases will wind up being the development tool you deal with the most day-to-day: IDEs.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-117"><a id="_idTextAnchor117"/>Working all in one place – IDEs</h1>
<p>In <a href="B18315_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, I showed<a id="_idIndexMarker380"/> you some very basic HTML and suggested that you enter it into a plain text editor such as Notepad if you’re using Windows. For a long time, that’s all there was – just plain text editors. After a while, they got more advanced. For example, some could recognize various programming languages and provide color coding to make them easier to digest, or they could recognize functions in something such as JavaScript and show you a list to the side. They started to become more than just plain text editors – in other words, they started to become aware of the <em class="italic">content</em> of the text.</p>
<p>Not long after that started to happen, a new evolution occurred: IDEs. These are pieces of software that provide comprehensive facilities to developers. You might almost say an IDE is a text editor that is <em class="italic">hyper</em>-aware of the text being edited. It understands what you’re doing and aids you in many ways. IDEs increase your productivity by combining most of the common activities involved in writing software into a single application. You stay in one place as you work and have everything you need at your fingertips rather than having to jump between several windows or interfaces to get your work done.</p>
<p>An IDE typically includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic">Code editor</em>: I mean, obviously, right?! But it’s a text editor that’s specialized for writing and editing programming source code and typically includes features such as syntax highlighting, code formatting, and code navigation.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Compiler or interpreter</em>: Some programming languages need to be turned into other languages before they can be run. It sounds weird, but it’s true! This process is called <em class="italic">compilation</em>, and it’s done with a <em class="italic">compiler</em>. Languages that <em class="italic">can</em> be run exactly as they are use an <em class="italic">interpreter</em> instead. However, regardless of which is needed, it’s a tool you have to engage somehow, and usually, it’s a separate command-line interface. But with an IDE, it’s all built-in and controlled with the IDE interface, so you never have to leave it, which is a key benefit of an IDE.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Debugger</em>: A debugger<a id="_idIndexMarker381"/> is a tool that helps you test and debug your code by allowing things such as executing the code line by line, viewing the state of variables at any moment in time, or skipping sections of code so you can focus on specific areas. Any IDE worth its salt will have a solid debugger built into it.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Build automation</em>: Once you’re done writing your code and have tested and debugged it, you usually need to create some sort of package that the underlying operating system or runtime environment will use when you want to distribute your app to others. This, we say, is when you “build and package” your app, and IDEs provide ways to automate this normally manual process.</li>
<li><em class="italic">SCM</em>: An IDE will almost certainly know how to work with Git and other SCM systems, and they will usually provide a more visual approach to using them. Some people greatly prefer this approach to the command line – I’m one of them – because it allows you to not have to remember a bunch of commands and options and instead work with your code and SCM more abstractly.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Extensibility</em>: Any good IDE will have some mechanism to extend its capabilities, whether they’re called plugins, extensions, or something else. Through this, you can add support for new languages, or tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>IDEs come in all shapes and sizes. Some are free, some cost money, some are just good text editors with a few added capabilities, and some can do so much that they could seemingly pilot the space shuttle if you asked them to!</p>
<p>In the following subsections, we’ll look at several of the most popular IDEs. As you read about them and look at the example screenshots, notice the similarities: they all, generally, have an area in the center for editing source code, surrounded by several small tool windows or<a id="_idIndexMarker382"/> areas. This is, generically, the point of an IDE: give you a solid, content-aware text editor at the cen<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">ter with context-aware tools </a>around it to help get your work done.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-118"><a id="_idTextAnchor118"/>VS Code</h2>
<p>VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com) may <a id="_idIndexMarker383"/>well be <a id="_idIndexMarker384"/>the most popular IDE today. It hails from Microsoft and is billed as a free, lightweight, cross-platform (meaning it can run on Windows, Mac, Linux, and even on the web itself!) source code editor with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript (we’ll get to this in later chapters), and Node. It is generally a pretty bare-bones IDE out of the box, but it is extremely extensible through a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages, runtimes, tools, and technologies, so you can make it do just about anything you need.</p>
<p>Developers tend to like VS Code because it “gets out of their way.” Some people find some other IDEs to have a little <em class="italic">too</em> much capability, believe it or not! After all, at the end of the day, it all comes down to the code you’re writing, so an environment that takes space away from seeing your code is sometimes not what you want. VS Code, by default at least, does a good job of focusing on your code, but you can add to it later as you see fit.</p>
<p><em class="italic">Figure 4</em><em class="italic">.7</em> shows VS Code, though do note that this is my current setup, so you’re seeing more there than you’ll get by default since I’ve installed many extensions already (which you can tell by the number of icons on the left – by default, there would only be a few of those, but some of the extensions I’ve added also add icons there):</p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.7: VS Code</p>
<p>With that said though, notice how there isn’t a lot around the code. There’s just the code, a project directory list on the left, and a command prompt on the right. And by default, the command<a id="_idIndexMarker385"/> prompt won’t even be <a id="_idIndexMarker386"/>shown. That’s what “gets out of your way” means, and you can contrast that to something such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA when <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com">I show them shortly since they sho</a>w a bit more by default.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-119"><a id="_idTextAnchor119"/>Visual Studio</h2>
<p><strong class="bold">Visual Studio</strong> (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com), in a sense, is the big brother of VS Code and also <a id="_idIndexMarker387"/>happens to be<a id="_idIndexMarker388"/> from Microsoft. It predates VS Code by many years (probably even decades at this point). Historically, Visual Studio has primarily been for working with Microsoft languages such as .NET and C#, but over the years, it has grown to encompass just about every technology out there, whether from Microsoft or not.  Microsoft offers a slightly limited free community edition, and then a full-featured version that comes along with a paid subscription model (this can cost as low as around $500 and as high as around $6,000 at the time of writing).</p>
<p>Visual Studio used to be something of a joke in that it was very heavy, very slow, and tended to not be as stable as you want something you’re writing original code in. But that couldn’t be further from what it is today. Now, it’s a very highly respected and well-regarded IDE that lots of people swear by.</p>
<p><em class="italic">Figure 4</em><em class="italic">.8</em> shows what <a id="_idIndexMarker389"/>Visual Studio<a id="_idIndexMarker390"/> looks like. Unlike VS Code, I haven’t done a lot of customization to my Visual Studio installation, so a fresh install won’t look too much different than this:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.8: Visual Studio</p>
<p>I mentioned that Visual Studio is something of the big brother to VS Code. What I mean by that is that Visual Studio includes more functionality, at least out of the box. It has more robust debugging facilities, can more seamlessly work with various types of servers, and can even be used to debug Windows-native applications in real-time. VS Code, since its<a id="_idIndexMarker391"/> inception, has <a id="_idIndexMarker392"/>narrowed that gap, especially when the right extensions<a href="https://www.eclipse.org/ide"> are installed, but Visual </a>Studio is still more feature-rich out of the box.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-120"><a id="_idTextAnchor120"/>Eclipse</h2>
<p><strong class="bold">Eclipse</strong> (https://www.eclipse.org/ide) might <a id="_idIndexMarker393"/>be the most famous IDE out there. It’s a free (though <a id="_idIndexMarker394"/>donations are greatly appreciated!) and open-source IDE that has historically been primarily for Java development, but just like Visual Studio, it has grown over the years and now can do it all.</p>
<p>Eclipse is rather old, though I don’t say that pejoratively, simply that it’s been around for a long, long time. Like Visual Studio, it wasn’t always as well-regarded as it is now. Over the years, its performance has improved significantly, as has the relative simplicity and coherence of its user interface, to a point now where a lot of people love Eclipse.</p>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-121"><a id="_idTextAnchor121"/>IntelliJ IDEA</h2>
<p>IntelliJ IDEA (or simply IDEA) (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea) is an IDE by the company<a id="_idIndexMarker395"/> JetBrains. This is another <a id="_idIndexMarker396"/>IDE that started primarily for a specific technology – Java, in this case – but rapidly grew to be able to handle almost everything else. This is my personal favorite due to its excellent performance, stability, and extreme extensibility. JetBrains offers a free community edition, as well as a paid advanced version.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the community edition has a few more significant limitations as opposed to the others listed here, namely that web development is somewhat limited. Fortunately, the cost of a paid license isn’t all that much (as of this writing, it’s $169 for the first year, $135 for the second year, and then $101 for each year after that for a license for an individual developer) and <em class="italic">for sure</em> it’s well worth that money for the power it puts in your hands. It is, of course, more for an organization ($599 per year), so it comes down to what kind of license you need.</p>
<p>In any case, <em class="italic">Figure 4</em><em class="italic">.10</em> reveals what IDEA looks like, at least in my case, with quite a few extensions active in it:</p>

<p>This is by no means <a id="_idIndexMarker397"/>an exhaustive list, but I think <a id="_idIndexMarker398"/>these four are probably the most popular at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Now, let’s jump tracks and touch on another topic that you should be aware of, that being operating systems – more specifically, Linux.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-122"><a id="_idTextAnchor122"/>Understanding the operating system – Linux</h1>
<p>So, you write <a id="_idIndexMarker399"/>your code, and you write it securely, and you get it under SCM. But what do you do when it comes time to deploy your code – that is, put it where it will run? There’s no singular answer to this question because how and where you can run your code is a question with myriad answers. But one thing is for sure: they’re all going to involve an operating system of some sort in some fashion.</p>
<p>While Windows is, at the time of writing, still the world’s most popular desktop operating system, the story is very different when we talk about servers. While you will find a good number of Windows-based servers out there too, most servers run Linux.</p>
<p><strong class="bold">Linux</strong> is an open-source operating system written and first released by Linus Torvalds in 1991. The basic architecture of Linux is based on the Unix operating system, which was initially released way back in 1971, though it has a history – in a slightly different form – stretching back to the 1960s. Linux’s history is also the history of the internet in a sense as its use grew right alongside the internet. It became the backbone for server infrastructure, powering websites and online services due to its robustness and flexibility, and is also the poster child for <a id="_idIndexMarker400"/>the <strong class="bold">free/open-source software</strong> (<strong class="bold">FOSS</strong>) movement as easily the largest and most well-known open source project ever.</p>
<p>Unix, and hence Linux, is stable, generally secure, and free, which makes it quite popular for many purposes. It is fundamentally based on principles of modularity and reusability, meaning it can be tweaked and reorganized with specific goals in mind. It is this quality that makes it flexible and gives rise to hundreds, if not thousands, of distributions – or <em class="italic">distros</em> – which are just variants of Linux, different collections of system libraries and tweaked kernels and such. Different distros have different focuses. Some are built as specifically as web servers; some are geared toward desktop machines; some have very small memory and hardware requirements making them ideal for small embedded systems; some are targeted to musicians; some are targeted to scientists… and so on.</p>
<p>Now, let’s take a <a id="_idIndexMarker401"/>high-level look at some of the very basics of Linux, including its overall structure, some of the most common commands you might encounter, and the role of security in Linux.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-123"><a id="_idTextAnchor123"/>The structure of Linux</h2>
<p>The basic structure <a id="_idIndexMarker402"/>of Linux can be understood as a series of layers, one on top of the other. Starting from the lowest layer, we have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic">Kernel</em>: A piece of software that’s responsible for managing hardware resources primarily – things such as the CPU, memory, and peripheral devices.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Filesystem</em>: Any operating system will need to include a filesystem – the structure of how information is stored on a storage device. Linux supports many different filesystems, but for the most part, it abstracts the differences away so that you can treat any filesystem the same as any other.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Shell</em>: The interface that’s used by a user to interact with the kernel. In most cases, out of the box, this is a command line interface (and even for Linux distros that have a GUI, there is always a command line interface available as well).</li>
<li><em class="italic">Utilities</em>: Software tools for managing the system. These are just small programs, each with very small, explicit purposes – things such as creating users, managing files, viewing system resource usage, and so on.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Applications</em>: User-level programs such as browsers and word processors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Linux distributions bundle the kernel with various software, both utilities and applications, to create complete operating systems. This software provides the basic commands you <a id="_idIndexMarker403"/><a id="_idIndexMarker404"/>can execute at the Linux command line, which by default is how you interact with the operating system.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-124"><a id="_idTextAnchor124"/>Basic commands</h2>
<p>While there are<a id="_idIndexMarker405"/> hundreds of commands you can execute at a Linux command line, there is a much smaller set of commands you’ll use frequently. What that set of commands is will depend on what you’re doing, but some of the most important and most-used commands would certainly include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ls</code>: List directory contents</li>
<li><code>cd</code> and <code>pwd</code>: Change directory (navigate the filesystem) and print working directory (tell you where you are on the filesystem)</li>
<li><code>grep</code>: Search text in files</li>
<li><code>cp</code> and <code>mv</code>: Copy file or directory and move file or directory</li>
<li><code>rm</code>: Remove file or directory</li>
<li><code>sudo</code>: Execute a command as another user</li>
<li><code>mkdir</code>: Make a new directory in the current working directory</li>
<li><code>man</code>: View manual pages (instructions for various commands)</li>
<li><code>chmod</code>: Change file and directory permissions</li>
<li><code>touch</code>: Create a new file or update the last accessed and modified date/time on an existing file</li>
<li><code>ps</code> and <code>kill</code>: View information about the processes currently running on the system and stop (kill) them if needed</li>
<li><code>less</code> and <code>more</code>: Inspect the contents of a file (<code>more</code> is a simplistic application that offers fairly basic viewing features, whereas <code>less</code> offers more advanced features, such as two-way scrolling, robust searching, and more interactivity for the user)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is in no way a comprehensive list, nor is it attempting to be. There are plenty more commands out there, and <a id="_idIndexMarker406"/>perhaps one of the best places to find them is <a id="_idIndexMarker407"/>the <em class="italic">Man Page </em><em class="italic">Repository</em>: <a href="https://www.unix.com/man-page-repository.php">https://www.unix.com/man-page-repository.php</a>).</p>
<p>But, of all of them, <code>man</code> might be the one to remember most. That’s because it’s a command that can give you information about <em class="italic">other</em> commands! For example, if you forget what the syntax of the <code>cp</code> command is – syntax being the form and structure of the command and any information you might have to provide to it – you can simply execute <code>man cp</code> to get that information, as you can see in <em class="italic">Figure 4</em><em class="italic">.11</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 4.11: The output of executing man cp" src="img/B18315_04_11.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.11: The output of executing man cp</p>
<p>Here, you can see how you are provided with information about how to use the command, including a brief description of its purpose, some examples of its syntax, and the various options it supports. More is given for this command than you can see in a static image on the<a id="_idIndexMarker408"/> page, but when using <code>man</code> for real, you can continue to scroll through the documentation, which can be quite long for some commands, while rather short for others – it all depends on what the command is and everything it can do.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-125"><a id="_idTextAnchor125"/>Security and the one “weird” Linux fact you need to know</h2>
<p>Linux is, at its<a id="_idIndexMarker409"/> core, very security-conscious. It is also at its core a multi-user system. Every file and directory is owned by a specific user and user group, and a user who doesn’t own a file or isn’t in an appropriate group cannot access it. Linux has a robust system of permissions, which is to say the various rights a user or group has for a file or directory. You can give users the right to read a file but not edit it, for example. The ability to run a file – assuming it’s a program of some sort – is its own right, meaning you might be able to read and edit a program file but not execute it.</p>
<p>Permissions are hierarchical as well, meaning that you can be granted rights to a directory, which then filters down to the directories and files under it by default (though you can alter the rights for a specific file or subdirectory too). This allows for very granular control over access rights for various users, making it safe for them to work on the same system without risking conflicting with one another.</p>
<p>The one exception to all this security stuff is the special root user. This user is, in a sense, the god of the machine. The root user can do anything, to any file or directory, at any time. There is always a root user account, although sometimes, it may not be usable by any human user. This is necessary because some operations are so core to Linux itself that no other user <em class="italic">should</em> be able to do it. Or it should be very limited at the least. In such cases, Linux offers the ability to temporarily “switch” to the root user, meaning you can, as a regular old user, execute a specific command as if you were the root user, assuming you’ve been granted special rights to do that. This allows high-level system management tasks to be available to users as needed but in a very tightly controlled fashion.</p>
<p>I’ve mentioned files several times, and surely you know what files are because they’re no different from any other operating system, but Linux has one fact that is a little weird when you first encounter it – everything in Linux is a file. And when I say everything, I mean (almost) <em class="italic">everything</em>.</p>
<p>In Linux, “everything is<a id="_idIndexMarker410"/> a file” means that the operating system allows you to work with things that aren’t files the same way you do actual files. To put it another way, it’s the idea that Linux handles input and output to and from resources such as hard drives, modems, keyboards, printers, and other system resources and devices as streams of data exposed through the filesystem, as if they were files on that filesystem.</p>
<p>The consequence of this is that not only can actual files be interacted with from the command line or other programs using file operations such as reading and writing, but so can directories, system information, hardware devices, and even some system processes. For example, accessing a device such as a printer might involve writing data to a file that represents the printer, which will cause the printer to physically print that data on a piece of paper. Or you might read from a file representing the system’s memory usage to see how much free memory you have. This design makes programming and resource management more uniform and simpler since you don’t need to use any special methods to deal with hardware devices and system resources, and you can use all the same commands and utilities as you would with regular files.</p>
<p>Now that you have a (very) broad idea of what Linux is all about, let’s talk about why it’s even important<a id="_idIndexMarker411"/> to know about for a web developer.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-126"><a id="_idTextAnchor126"/>Linux for web developers</h2>
<p>With Linux being so <a id="_idIndexMarker412"/>commonly used for servers, that means knowing <a id="_idIndexMarker413"/>Linux is a valuable thing for a web developer. Now, to be clear, there is knowing Linux and then there’s <em class="italic">knowing</em> Linux. A web developer probably doesn’t need to be a stone-cold Linux expert like, say, a server administrator does; those folks must have very deep knowledge of the system and how to work with it, and that simply takes a lot of time and experience. Certainly, as a web developer, the more you know the better, but you can start slowly with just some basics, and that’ll be sufficient so that you aren’t lost.</p>
<p>Fortunately, getting your feet wet with Linux is pretty easy. Several websites will let you run Linux in your browser or will connect you to a Linux instance on the server that you can then interact with through your browser. Either way, you’ll get a command-line interface right there in your browser, with no need to install Linux on your machine!</p>
<p>One good option for playing with Linux like this is <a href="https://bellard.org/jslinux">https://bellard.org/jslinux</a>. Here, you can choose from several distros and have them running in your browser, as you can see in <em class="italic">Figure 4</em><em class="italic">.12</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 4.12: Alpine Linux running in your browser, courtesy of JavaScript/Linux" src="img/B18315_04_12.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.12: Alpine Linux running in your browser, courtesy of JavaScript/Linux</p>
<p>I strongly suggest taking some time to play around here – it’s not like you can do any harm! To get you started with some basics, start by executing the following command:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
cd /</pre> <p>The <code>cd</code> command stands for <em class="italic">change directory</em>. Here, you’re navigating to the <strong class="bold">root directory</strong>, which<a id="_idIndexMarker414"/> is the parent to all the others on the system.</p>
<p>To see what’s in that directory, execute this command:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
ls -lha</pre> <p>The <code>ls</code> command is short for <em class="italic">list</em>, as in <em class="italic">list directory contents</em>. Here, the <code>-lha</code> options each tell <code>ls</code> that you want the listing shown a specific way. The <code>l</code> option tells it you want a long listing, meaning it shows more details. The <code>h</code> option tells it you want all numbers shown in a more human-readable form (4k for a file size instead of 4,096, for example), and the <code>a</code> option tells it not to hide entries that begin with a period, which denotes hidden files and directories.</p>
<p>Next, navigate to your home directory, which is a directory every Linux user gets by default, with this command:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
cd ~</pre> <p>The tilde character is<a id="_idIndexMarker415"/> a special one that Linux knows means you want to go to <a id="_idIndexMarker416"/>your home directory. Normally, when you use the <code>cd</code> command, you have to specify the full directory path, either starting from the root directory or the current directory. But navigating to your home directory is such a common thing that Linux provides this helpful shortcut.</p>
<p>However, the tilde isn’t the real directory path – it’s just a shortcut. To see the real path, use this command:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
pwd</pre> <p>The <code>pwd</code> command stands for <em class="italic">print working directory</em>. The value you see will always be <code>/home/&lt;your username&gt;</code>. Your username will usually be determined by the administrator of the machine (in the case of one of the online Linux playgrounds, a user will almost certainly be created when Linux starts up). Of course, if you set Linux up yourself, then you will have chosen the username as part of the setup process.</p>
<p>Next, let’s create a file:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
touch my_file</pre> <p>Execute a directory listing again (and maybe this time just execute <code>ls</code> without any options to see the difference) and you’ll now see a new file named <code>my_file</code>. There are many ways to edit files in Linux and many ways to get content into a file, so let’s try perhaps the simplest way:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
echo "hello there" &gt; my_file</pre> <p>The string in quotes will be written into the file (<em class="italic">echoed</em> to it). To see that it has, you can list the contents of the file like so:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
cat my_file</pre> <p>The <code>cat</code> command is short for <em class="italic">concatenate</em>, but it also is used to print to the standard output, which is the screen where the command prompt itself is. So, <code>cat my_file</code> outputs the contents of the file to the screen, and you should see the string in quote in it when you do.</p>
<p>The last thing I’ll touch on is users and permissions. Earlier, I mentioned that every user of a Linux system gets a home directory. Every unique user on the system will not only have a home directory but a user account. Linux, and Unix, which it’s based on, is inherently a multi-user system, and it’s these user accounts – and the rights they have – that allow the system to be shared. No other user of the system is allowed to touch the contents of your home directory unless you specifically allow them to.</p>
<p>If you list the <a id="_idIndexMarker417"/>directory contents again using the <code>-lha</code> option, one of the<a id="_idIndexMarker418"/> things you’ll see, in the second and third column of data, is the owner of the file and the primary group name, respectively. The meaning of the owner of the file should be obvious: it’ll be your <em class="italic">username</em>! Since you created the file, you own it and you can do whatever you like with it. However, anyone in the same user group, denoted by the third column, can also access the file.</p>
<p>Groups are a way users can be organized in Linux for easier administration. When you create the file, the group may well be the same as your username. That simply means that on this particular Linux system, by default, a group is created for each user, named the same as the username. Since no one else will be in that group, it means that the file is truly only accessible by the user. In a way, it means that the group is irrelevant in this case.</p>
<p>If you want to give ownership to another user, there’s a command for that:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
chown &lt;new_owner_username&gt; my_file</pre> <p>The <code>chown</code> command stands for change owner. After executing it, you will no longer be able to access the file yourself since the username specified in the command will own it (you typically wouldn’t do this in your home directory, but you definitely can).</p>
<p>You can’t allow a specific user the ability to edit your file, but what you can do is give anyone in the group the ability to do so:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
chmod g+w my_file</pre> <p>The <code>chmod</code> command, short for <em class="italic">change mode</em>, means to change the access mode, or permissions, of something. This command can take a wide range of options in several forms, but in this example, <code>g+w</code> simply means to add (<code>+</code>) the write (<code>w</code>) permission to the primary group (<code>g</code>). After that, anyone in that group will be able to edit the file.</p>
<p>A couple of times now, I said that only you, by default, will be able to edit your file, but that’s not 100% true. You should also be aware that there is always a user named root on a Linux system. This is, in a sense, the god of the machine. The root user can do everything at all times and the root user account is meant for the administrator(s) of the machine.</p>
<p>However, even administrators will often log into the system as regular, non-root users, meaning they have no special privileges. This is an important security maxim known as the principle of least privilege. This means that a user should have the rights necessary to perform their <a id="_idIndexMarker419"/>duties, and no more. However, an administrator needs <a id="_idIndexMarker420"/>to have greater rights, so what they are allowed to do is <em class="italic">elevate</em> their privileges <em class="italic">temporarily</em>.</p>
<p>To execute privileged commands, they have to use a special command:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
sudo</pre> <p>The <code>sudo</code> command stands for <code>super user do</code>, and it means “Hey, Linux, if I’m allowed, I want to execute this command as if I was the root user.” The system will maintain a list of commands that each user is allowed to execute with <code>sudo</code>, and doing so is the same as executing that command if they were logged in as root, but only for as long as it takes to execute the command. That’s the key. Note that you may not be able to experiment with <code>sudo</code> with an online Linux playground, but it’s an important concept to be aware of because even non-administrators will often have access to some degree of elevated privileges through <code>sudo</code>, and it’s commonly needed to get your work done on Linux.</p>
<p>And with that, we’ve covered the “non-code,” so to speak, topics for this chapter.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-127"><a id="_idTextAnchor127"/>Reviewing the roadmap</h1>
<p>With this chapter<a id="_idIndexMarker421"/> concluded, we can now show a few more squares in our web developer roadmap:</p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.13: The roadmap, with a few more boxes filled in</p>
<p>Well now, that’s starting to fill out nicely, isn’t it? This chapter revealed the <strong class="bold">Source Control</strong>, <strong class="bold">Security</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Linux</strong> boxes. It also built on a few others, including networking and developer tooling. We’re moving right along!</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-128"><a id="_idTextAnchor128"/>Summary</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we touched on several topics that are of large importance to web developers, but which aren’t explicitly about writing code. This included SCM – primarily in the form of Git, Linux, secure coding practices, and IDEs. You saw how SCM is a key component of your web development workflow, how IDEs can make your life a lot easier in that work, how thinking about security from the ground up when writing code is of paramount importance, and how Linux is the one operating system to rule them all, one operating system to find them, one operating system to bring them all and in the darkness bind them (sorry, I’m a geek – I couldn’t resist the cheap Lord of the Rings reference!).</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we’ll continue looking at some things that continue the theme of this chapter – that is, topics that you’ll need to know about that may not directly be code (but of course, it’s <em class="italic">all</em> about the code in <em class="italic">some</em> fashion ultimately). This includes the famous term “the cloud,” virtual machines and containers, DevOps (whatever that is!), Python, graphic design, UX, and responsive design. Let’s keep pushing this boulder up the hill, shall we?</p>
