- en: Making sound effects for manga is an art form in and of itself. It takes a lot
    of work and skill to turn sound into text! The letters that you choose to represent
    a sound are important, but so are the font, the colors, and even whether you choose
    to distort those letters for emphasis.

    with and without noticing while reading through stories. It’s not just about choosing
    the right word; there is creative space for sound effects, expressing the sharpness,
    loudness, and heaviness of sounds.

    naturally blend into my art. If you look at the **India ink** subcategory in the
    **Brush** tools, there are good organic-feeling brushes, such as the **Bit husky**
    brush.

    close to the object that is making the sound. If you write sound effects on a
    separate layer, it will save a lot of time when you want to edit them later, such
    as changing the color or shape, picking a different sound effect, or even translating
    to another language! *Figure 11.1* shows a few examples of handwritten sound effects.

- en: In this concise chapter, we have explored ways to create sound effects. We have
    used specialized fonts to make sound effects and have learned how to make those
    fonts more punchy with outlines and gradient effects. We used clipping layers
    to add a pattern to a sound effect and learned about mesh transformation to distort
    and curve our sound effects. Finally, we looked at various title text artworks
    using some of the techniques we learned, such as downloading fonts, using the
    Mesh Transformation tool, and using clipping masks.
