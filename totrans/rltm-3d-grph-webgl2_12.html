                    <h1 class="header-title">WebGL Libraries</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="mce-root">Before we dive into various WebGL libraries, we should first define what a software library is. Although <strong>library</strong> and <strong>framework</strong> are often used interchangeably, they refer to <em>different</em> concepts in computer science. A software library comprises defined code, configuration, documentation, classes, scripts, and more, so that developers may include them in their programs to enhance their products. For example, in developing a program requiring extensive mathematical operations, a developer may include a suitable software library (for example, <kbd>glMatrix</kbd>) to reduce the need for writing those operations themselves.</p>
<p class="mce-root">That being said, as you may have noticed, we've built our 3D application in such a way that the classes, utilities, and overall architecture could, eventually, be turned into a library. This process was done intentionally so that we could learn concepts in isolation and also write code that could eventually comprise a feature-rich WebGL library that can be used by other applications.</p>
<p class="mce-root">That being said, it's important to know when and where to use libraries, so let's cover a few WebGL libraries of various sizes.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples of small, non-prescriptive WebGL libraries that provide many helpers, utilities, and abstraction layers over WebGL's low-level API.</p>

<p><strong>TWGL</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/greggman/twgl.js">https://github.com/greggman/twgl.js</a>) is an open-source WebGL library that serves to "<em>make using the WebGL API less verbose</em>". For example, here's a simple TWGL demo that shows its intelligible, yet low-level, API on top of WebGL:</p>
<pre>const<br/>  canvas = document.getElementById('webgl-canvas'),<br/>  gl = canvas.getContext('webgl'),<br/>  program = twgl.createProgramInfo(gl, ['vertex-shader', 'fragment-shader']),<br/>  arrays = {<br/>    position: [<br/>      -1, -1, 0,<br/>      1, -1, 0,<br/>      -1, 1, 0,<br/>      -1, 1, 0,<br/>      1, -1, 0,<br/>      1, 1, 0<br/>    ],<br/>  },<br/>  bufferInfo = twgl.createBufferInfoFromArrays(gl, arrays);<br/><br/>function draw(time) {<br/>  const { width, height } = gl.canvas;<br/><br/>  twgl.resizeCanvasToDisplaySize(gl.canvas);<br/>  gl.viewport(0, 0, width, height);<br/><br/>  const uniforms = {<br/>    time: time * 0.001,<br/>    resolution: [width, height],<br/>  };<br/><br/>  gl.useProgram(program.program);<br/><br/>  twgl.setBuffersAndAttributes(gl, program, bufferInfo);<br/>  twgl.setUniforms(program, uniforms);<br/>  twgl.drawBufferInfo(gl, bufferInfo);<br/><br/>  requestAnimationFrame(draw);<br/>}<br/><br/>requestAnimationFrame(draw);</pre>

<p><strong>Regl</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/regl-project/regl">https://github.com/regl-project/regl</a>) is an open-source WebGL library with a functional flavor. As its documentation explains, Regl "<em>simplifies WebGL programming by removing as much shared state as it can get away with. To do this, it replaces the WebGL API with two fundamental abstractions, <strong>resources</strong> and <strong>commands</strong></em>". Here's the snippet of code that illustrates the functional Regl API:</p>
<pre>const regl = require('regl')();<br/><br/>const vertexShader = `<br/>  precision mediump float;<br/><br/>  attribute vec2 position;<br/>    <br/>  void main(void) {<br/>    gl_Position = vec4(position, 0, 1);<br/>  }<br/>`;<br/><br/>const fragmentShader = `<br/>  precision mediump float;<br/><br/>  uniform vec4 color;<br/><br/>  void main(void) {<br/>    gl_FragColor = color;<br/>  }<br/>`;<br/><br/>const drawTriangle = regl({<br/>  vert: vertexShader,<br/>  frag: fragmentShader,<br/>  attributes: {<br/>    position: regl.buffer([<br/>      [-2, -2],<br/>      [4, -2],<br/>      [4, 4]<br/>    ])<br/>  },<br/>  uniforms: {<br/>    color: regl.prop('color')<br/>  },<br/>  count: 3<br/>});<br/><br/>regl.frame(({ time }) =&gt; {<br/>  <br/>  regl.clear({<br/>    color: [1, 1, 1, 1],<br/>    depth: 1<br/>  });<br/><br/>  drawTriangle({<br/>    color: [<br/>      Math.cos(time * 0.001),<br/>      Math.sin(time * 0.0008),<br/>      Math.cos(time * 0.003),<br/>      1<br/>    ]<br/>  });<br/>  <br/>});</pre>

<p><strong>StackGL</strong> (<a href="http://stack.gl/">http://stack.gl</a>) is an open source WebGL project with an interesting approach to building WebGL applications. Instead of being bundled as a single library, it's an ecosystem, comprised of many small, lean modules, inspired by the Unix philosophy.</p>
<p>Unix philosophy<strong><br/>
<br/></strong> The Unix mindset is a philosophical approach to writing minimalist, modular software, often expressed with the mantra "do one thing, and do it well!". For more information, please visit the following URL: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy</a>.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>Unlike many 3D engines, StackGL emphasizes lean, modular code that is focused on writing shader code. That being said, be sure to visit their website, as it includes extensive documentation and demos that will help you master this approach.</p>

<p>While small, lean, and modular WebGL libraries are useful, they may not be enough for complex applications. Here are several feature-rich WebGL libraries that offer an extensive list of features and capabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Three.js</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js">https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js</a>) is an open source library that powers many of the WebGL applications on the web. It aims to create an easy to use, lightweight, 3D library, with multiple renderers that target 2D <kbd>canvas</kbd>, WebGL, SVG, and CSS3D. Here's a neat demo of a rotating cube, showcasing the simplicity of the Three.js API:</p>
<pre>let<br/>  renderer,<br/>  scene,<br/>  camera,<br/>  mesh,<br/>  width = window.innerWidth,<br/>  height = window.innerHeight;<br/><br/>function init() {<br/>  camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(70, width / height, 0.01, 10);<br/>  camera.position.z = 1;<br/><br/>  scene = new THREE.Scene();<br/><br/>  const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(<br/>    // geometry<br/>    new THREE.BoxGeometry(0.2, 0.2, 0.2),<br/>    // material<br/>    new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial()<br/>  );<br/>  scene.add(mesh);<br/><br/>  renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer({ antialias: true });<br/>  renderer.setSize(width, height);<br/>  document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);<br/>}<br/><br/>function render() {<br/>  requestAnimationFrame(render);<br/>  mesh.rotation.x += 0.01;<br/>  mesh.rotation.y += 0.02;<br/>  renderer.render(scene, camera);<br/>}<br/><br/>init();<br/>render();</pre>

<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign"><strong>Babylon.js</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js">https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js</a>) is an open source WebGL library that came to fruition inside of Microsoft. It is a powerful library that was recently rewritten entirely in TypeScript.</p>
<p>TypeScript<strong><br/>
<br/></strong> TypeScript is an open source language developed by Microsoft. It is a powerful language that is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to JavaScript. For more information, visit <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript">https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript</a>.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>Although choosing Babylon.js doesn't require using TypeScript, it can be a major advantage over other libraries if you or your team prefer the features that TypeScript provides. Here's an interesting JavaScript demo, showcasing the simple Babylon.js API:</p>
<pre>const canvas = document.getElementById('webgl-canvas');<br/><br/>const engine = new BABYLON.Engine(<br/>  canvas,<br/>  true,<br/>  {<br/>    preserveDrawingBuffer: true,<br/>    stencil: true<br/>  }<br/>);<br/><br/>function initScene() {<br/>  const scene = new BABYLON.Scene(engine);<br/><br/>  const camera = new BABYLON.FreeCamera('camera', new BABYLON.Vector3(0, 5, <br/>   -10), scene);<br/>  camera.setTarget(BABYLON.Vector3.Zero());<br/>  camera.attachControl(canvas, false);<br/><br/>  const ground = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateGround('ground', 6, 6, 2, scene, <br/>   false);<br/><br/>  const sphere = BABYLON.Mesh.CreateSphere('sphere', 16, 2, scene, false, <br/>   BABYLON.Mesh.FRONTSIDE);<br/>  sphere.position.y = 1;<br/><br/>  const light = new BABYLON.HemisphericLight('light', new <br/>   BABYLON.Vector3(0, 1, 0), scene);<br/><br/>  return scene;<br/>}<br/><br/>const scene = initScene();<br/>engine.runRenderLoop(() =&gt; scene.render());</pre>

<p><strong>A-Frame</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/aframevr/aframe">https://github.com/aframevr/aframe</a>) is an open-source web framework for building virtual reality (VR) experiences. It is primarily maintained by Mozilla and the WebVR community. Although other WebGL libraries, such as Three.js and Babylon.js, offer VR support, A-Frame was designed entirely for building VR applications for the web.</p>
<div><strong>A-Frame Core<br/>
<br/></strong> Although A-Frame is an entirely new project, it is built on top of the Three.js game engine.</div>
<p>Here's a demo showcasing the A-Frame's declarative API:</p>

<p>Another approach to building complex 3D applications is to use an established game engine. A game engine is a software development environment designed so that people can build complex 3D applications. Although developers use 3D engines to create games for consoles, mobile devices, and personal computers, they can also be used to build interactive web applications. Two powerful game engines that you can use in building complex WebGL applications are Unity and PlayCanvas.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Unity</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p><strong>Unity</strong> (<a href="https://unity3d.com">https://unity3D.com</a>) is a portable game engine developed by Unity Technologies that offers cross-platform capabilities. It was first announced and released in June 2005 at the Apple Inc. Worldwide Developers Conference as an OS X-exclusive game engine. Over the years, it has become the leading game engine for delivering some of the most well-known games across diverse platforms. Although Unity prioritizes native over web-based outputs, it does offer WebGL support:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/bb5f5311-2d9d-4f91-ad52-41bdc1e36b2e.png"/></p>

<p><strong>PlayCanvas</strong> (<a href="https://playcanvas.com/">https://playcanvas.com</a>) is an open source 3D game engine that also offers a proprietary cloud-hosted creation platform. Although other game engines, such as Unity, offer WebGL support, PlayCanvas was built from the ground-up for the web. Additionally, PlayCanvas offers a wonderful development experience since it has many powerful features, such as a visual workspace, full WebGL 2 support, simultaneous editing from multiple computers, and more:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/452bd9d3-1a44-4fec-9ca8-0b7747c26161.png"/></p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Testing WebGL 2 Applications</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>If you happened to open your browser's debugger tools throughout this book, you may have noticed that the <kbd>canvas</kbd> you saw was a complete "black box". That is, you cannot inspect any of its elements as you could with the DOM elements on a web page. If you come from a traditional web-development background, this may seem like a big problem, since we're used to leveraging the DOM to help us query elements to test our application. So, how can we ensure the quality and stability of our WebGL applications?</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Visual Regression Testing</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Image comparisons of various application states throughout the development cycle is a common approach for testing WebGL applications. This technique, often referred to as <strong>visual regression testing</strong>, performs front-end or user-interface regression testing by capturing the screenshots of web pages/UI and comparing them with the original images (either historical baseline screenshots or reference images from a live website):</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/497212fa-0ccd-4cda-9853-6e16eadb74cb.png"/></p>
<p>In the previous screenshot, you can see how the Baseline and Change are different via the final Diff output. This technique can be an effective approach for ensuring that your WebGL application continues to behave as expected.</p>
<p>Visual Regression Testing Tools<strong><br/>
<br/></strong> Given your language of choice, you can find many open source visual regression testing tools that fit your technology stack on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/search?q=visual+regression">https://github.com/search?q=visual+regression</a>).</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Application Introspection Testing</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Another approach is to mimic the DOM API by exposing your WebGL elements via a custom API. For example, if we want to query a DOM element by its ID, we would do so via <kbd>document.getElementById('element-id')</kbd>. We could do the same with jQuery's simpler API via <kbd>$('#element-id')</kbd>.</p>
<p>jQuery<strong><br/>
<br/></strong> jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify many of the common client-side scripting operations that are available. It is a free, open source software that uses the permissive MIT License. For more information, please visit <a href="https://jquery.com">https://jquery.com</a>.</p>
<p>To see an implementation of this approach, please refer to <strong>Three Musketeers</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/webgl/three-musketeer">https://github.com/webgl/three-musketeer</a>), an open source library, which can be included in <em>any</em> Three.js application with a single line of code. By including <kbd>three-musketeers</kbd>, we can run a variety of queries on elements in our scene, similar to DOM elements in a web page. Here are some sample queries for further illustration:</p>
<div><pre>$$$.debug();</pre>
<p><kbd>$$$</kbd> is an alias for a <kbd>three-musketeers</kbd> instance. The <kbd>debug</kbd> method enables visual debugging mode:</p>
<pre>$$$<br/>.find('Cube_1')<br/>.exists();<br/>// returns true<br/></pre>
<p>The <kbd>find</kbd> method searches the scene for an item with the ID of <kbd>Cube_1</kbd>. By calling <kbd>exists</kbd>, it returns a Boolean on whether it exists:</p>
<pre>$$$<br/>.findAll((node) =&gt; node.geometry.type === 'BoxGeometry');<br/></pre>
<p>Similar to <kbd>find</kbd>, <kbd>findAll</kbd> returns an array of items. In this case, instead of searching for a unique ID, we're looking for all of the geometries that match the <kbd>BoxGeometry</kbd> type:</p>
<pre>$$$<br/>.find('Cube_1')<br/>.click();<br/></pre>
<p>We find the geometry with the unique ID, <kbd>Cube_1</kbd>, and trigger a mouse click event on the <em>appropriate</em> coordinates:</p>
<pre>window.addEventListener('click', (event) =&gt; {<br/> const intersectedItems = $$$.pickFromEvent(event);<br/> console.log(intersectedItems);<br/>});</pre>
<p>This is a simple technique that's very helpful for debugging. Every time we click in our web page, we log all intersected geometries, given the mouse click's 2D coordinates mapped onto our 3D scene.</p>

<p>Throughout this book, we either constructed our own geometries or imported models that have been created in 3D modeling tools, such as Maya or Blender. Although these are common approaches for building 3D assets, they require manual labor to create them. Are there other techniques for getting geometries? Yes, of course! <strong>3D reconstruction</strong> is the process of creating 3D models from images. It is the reverse process of obtaining 2D images from 3D scenes. Here's an example of a 3D model that has been generated purely from aerial photographs by a technique called Photogrammetry:</p>

<p>Photogrammetry<br/>
<br/>
Photogrammetry is the science of making spatial measuring from photographs. This is a powerful technique for recovering the exact positions of surface points.

                    <h1 class="header-title">Physically-Based Rendering</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In <a href="0dcbfd9d-5446-48e9-90c1-841f4d160232.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Lights</em>, we learned how to illuminate our scene by mimicking light. We did so by leveraging various shading and light reflection techniques that use two main components: specular and diffuse. Although we've been modeling materials with specular and diffuse in computer graphics for a long time, these techniques produce results that are not very realistic. For example, changing the specularity of a material doesn't change the diffuse:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/87673064-c2cb-4076-b77b-ec9b248335fc.png" style="width:34.58em;height:25.92em;"/></p>
<p>The preceding screenshot demonstrates that changing the two parameters of specular intensity and specular hardness only changes the whitish part of the reflection. The blue diffuse reflection doesn't change at all—that's not how our physical world works! So, in applications aiming for more realistic effects, an artist would be tasked with manually tuning these values for each material until it "looked right", which is an inefficient method at best. There has to be a better way!</p>
<p class="mce-root">Enter <strong>Physically-Based Rendering</strong> (<strong>PBR</strong>), an approach to validate our material descriptions in the more objective, measurable, and scientific properties of real surfaces. One of the most apparent properties is the conservation of energy: a rougher surface will scatter light diffusely, while a smoother/more metallic surface will reflect light more directly, even though it's the same pool of light they are both drawn from. So, with all things being equal, the rule follows that as materials become shinier, the diffuse component should darken:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/afb0dd66-850e-4184-9567-0de0c84ea098.png" style="width:39.83em;height:14.83em;"/></p>
<p>Of course, there's more to physically-based rendering than energy conservation; however, this is a clear example that demonstrates the properties of a physically-based system. By keeping the reflection models similar to the way materials work in real life, we reduce the need for subjective manual tuning and produce real-world materials that look realistic under a variety of light conditions.</p>
