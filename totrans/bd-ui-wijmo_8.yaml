- en: Wijmo Open is a set of open source jQuery UI widgets. Wijmo widgets such as
    the slider, dialog, or accordion are extensions to jQuery UI's widgets. Others,
    such as Wijmo's menu or dropdown, are new widgets.

- en: In [Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. The Dialog Widget"), *The Dialog Widget*,
    I showed you how to add custom buttons to the dialog widget without changing the
    internals. The API is unwieldy, in that you must override the icons and behavior
    for a default button. Now, I will show you how to add a custom button by extending
    the API. First, open `jquery.wijmo-open.all.js` and rename it as `jquery.wijmo-open.all.extended.js`.

    semantics for ECMAScript 5 and allows code to run faster on browsers that support
    it. Let''s take a look at those lines that start with `WijDialog.prototype`. All
    the methods that start with an underscore are private, while the other ones are
    accessible through the API and documented. Under the `_createCaptionButtons` function,
    there is a `button` object with all the buttons on the title bar. To add a `hint`
    button to the dialog title bar, we use the same format as the other buttons:'
