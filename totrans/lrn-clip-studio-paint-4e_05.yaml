    different workspaces for different tasks. A workspace is a collection of palettes
    and their position on the interface. Clip Studio Paint comes with a few workspace
    options already in the program, but we can also create our own workspaces.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First of all, frame border layers are what Clip Studio Paint calls the specific
    type of layers that it makes comic panels from. Panels in comics are like shots
    in a movie or TV show. They contain the action and can also give a sense of the
    amount of time that’s passed or how much weight the action carries. Panels can
    also bring lots of drama and excitement to a page and can lead the reader’s eye
    around the composition, telling them what is important and what they should be
    looking at.

    tempo. So, we use roughly the same-sized frames to indicate a stable passing of
    time. In the example shown here, there are two people talking. A girl is sitting;
    we can see her full body on the first panel, then the close-up of her face on
    the second panel (it is Japanese style, so it reads from right to left), and a
    boy is slowly leaving the place.

    white mask of each of the layers. (For more information on layer masks, see *Chapter
    12*, *Making Layer Masks and Screentones*.) The following screenshot shows another

    the previous image! The bottom two frames depict the disappearing body of a boy,
    showing the two characters at the same angle. These two frames stay within the
    inner border of the page, but the top panel has been extended out beyond the margins
    to create a dynamic action scene of the characters.

- en: This is called a **bleed**, as we discussed earlier in the *The New file window
    – explained* section. It refers to any art that goes off the edge of the page.
    When printed, the paper will be trimmed down to the final finished size so that
    there is no white margin around the edge of the paper. This trimming of the paper
    after printing occurs in traditional book publishing, which is why we must always
    keep the interior margins of the page (**Default Bordersize** in the **New** file
    options in Clip Studio Paint – see *Chapter 2*, *Installing Clip Studio Paint
    Pro and Interface Basics*, for more information on creating a new file) in mind.
    Artwork, text, and anything else that is too close to the edge of the page are
    at risk of being cut off in the trimming process, so it is a good idea to keep
    anything important, such as dialog and speech balloons, inside the inner margins
    at all times.

    has a different panel layout? Create a framing template with one large panel around
    the inner border of the page and apply it to the story file. Then, use the **Divide
    Frame Folder** or **Divide Frame Border** tool to slice one large panel into smaller
    panels!

    settings we used in the example in the *Adding templates to a new file* section,
    unless you are required to create your manga in specific settings. In that way,
    you don’t need to worry about what settings you should configure each time you
    create a new file; it’s great to jump into creation quickly! Just ensure to keep
    the file resolution around 300 dpi.
