    different workspaces for different tasks. A workspace is a collection of palettes
    and their position on the interface. Clip Studio Paint comes with a few workspace
    options already in the program, but we can also create our own workspaces.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First of all, frame border layers are what Clip Studio Paint calls the specific
    type of layers that it makes comic panels from. Panels in comics are like shots
    in a movie or TV show. They contain the action and can also give a sense of the
    amount of time that’s passed or how much weight the action carries. Panels can
    also bring lots of drama and excitement to a page and can lead the reader’s eye
    around the composition, telling them what is important and what they should be
    looking at.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Panel layouts can be straightforward or much more detailed. Let’s take a look
    at a few comic panel examples, along with the way that their frame border layers
    are laid out in the **Layer** palette.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a quiet, conversational-based storytelling layout, time passes at a consistent
    tempo. So, we use roughly the same-sized frames to indicate a stable passing of
    time. In the example shown here, there are two people talking. A girl is sitting;
    we can see her full body on the first panel, then the close-up of her face on
    the second panel (it is Japanese style, so it reads from right to left), and a
    boy is slowly leaving the place.
  prefs: []

    the various frames of the comic. Each panel is created in its own frame or frame
    border folder, and you can tell which panel it is by looking at the black and
    white mask of each of the layers. (For more information on layer masks, see *Chapter
    12*, *Making Layer Masks and Screentones*.) The following screenshot shows another
    example of comic paneling:'

    the previous image! The bottom two frames depict the disappearing body of a boy,
    showing the two characters at the same angle. These two frames stay within the
    inner border of the page, but the top panel has been extended out beyond the margins
    to create a dynamic action scene of the characters.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is called a **bleed**, as we discussed earlier in the *The New file window
    – explained* section. It refers to any art that goes off the edge of the page.
    When printed, the paper will be trimmed down to the final finished size so that
    there is no white margin around the edge of the paper. This trimming of the paper
    after printing occurs in traditional book publishing, which is why we must always
    keep the interior margins of the page (**Default Bordersize** in the **New** file
    options in Clip Studio Paint – see *Chapter 2*, *Installing Clip Studio Paint
    Pro and Interface Basics*, for more information on creating a new file) in mind.
    Artwork, text, and anything else that is too close to the edge of the page are
    at risk of being cut off in the trimming process, so it is a good idea to keep
    anything important, such as dialog and speech balloons, inside the inner margins
    at all times.

    mask icons to the left of the layer names. The **Frame 1** layer contains one
    panel at the top, while the **Frame 2** layer contains a panel at the bottom left,
    and also the bottom right. These were created by toggling between the two options
    in the **How to add** drop-down menu in the Tool Properties for the **Rectangle
    frame** tool.

    us to see only what is inside the attached layer mask. The other two panels are
    shaded out and the contents of those frames will not be visible, and not affected
    when you draw.

    of the others. However, with panels created on the same layer, artwork can be
    shown in multiple panels continuously, so you don’t need to switch layers every
    time you are inking a different panel. Fewer steps, less hassle!

- en: Ultimately, the decision of whether to put all your frames on their own layers
    or all on one layer is yours to make. Putting each on its own layer means more
    layers to manage and more clicking around to complete your comic page. But putting
    them all on one layer means managing more of your creation process to ensure that
    artwork is only in the frame it’s supposed to be in.

- en: Personally, I work more comfortably using only one or two panel layers, just
    because there are fewer layers to toggle around, and it can make the work simple.
    But of course, the right choice for you will depend on your working style and
    preferences. This is especially true when you’re working on commissions and need
    to do a quick amendment of the panel order; it saves a lot of time having each
    panel in a separate layer so you can move the panel layer folders instead of re-drawing
    the contents!

    panel to select it. When selected, a red line will show along the outline of the
    panel, as well as some light-blue handles and small yellow arrows. Around the
    outside edge of the panel, a rectangle with a light-blue handle at each corner
    and a handle at the center top will also show.

    on one of the yellow arrows will automatically either take that edge of the panel
    out to the same size as a nearby panel (if there are any nearby panels) or take
    that side of the panel to the edge of the page. In *Figure 5.27*, the yellow arrow
    on the left-hand side of the panel was used to quickly make the panel bleed off
    the edge of the page.

    arrow once it is in the correct position for rotating. Click and drag to rotate

    the panel clockwise.
