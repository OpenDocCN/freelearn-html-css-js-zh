- en: We’ve spent a lot of time talking about the technical side of web development,
    how to get a job in the field, and some developmental topics to help you grow
    your career. But there’s another set of things that you need to be aware of to
    enjoy a fruitful career. These are things we call soft skills.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What are soft skills? These are things such as your attitude, how to communicate
    with others effectively, socializing appropriately with co-workers, continuing
    the growth of your technical knowledge, and software development methodologies.
    These are things that aren’t technical in nature and that you typically don’t
    learn in books or classrooms. You tend to learn them from the examples of others,
    and sometimes by trial and error. My goal is, hopefully, to remove as much of
    the error from that equation as possible!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Soft skills will not only help you get hired and be a good employee, but they
    also are vital to advancing your career. Even the best technicians will tend to
    plateau at some point in their career development if they lack soft skills. These
    skills become more important as you climb the ladder, but they’re always valuable,
    right from rung one!

    being someone friendly and helpful, someone who can be relied on to get the job

    is the cultural fit aspect of the interview. We almost always have to work with

    least not mind doing so. Therefore, you must make a good impression during an

    work done, then you’ve still performed a service to your employer. Of course,
    there is a balance that needs to be struck because we all have our own tasks to
    accomplish, so you must be careful not to give *too* much of yourself.

    remember our discussion of rubber duck debugging and Stack Overflow in [*Chapter

    doing X instead?” That expresses your concern with their work while not being
    as hard-edged. Of course, it should be obvious that you should never say something
    such as “This class structure is stupid”, but most people get that much right.

    you. Relying on people who make mistakes and own them is easy, but relying on
    people who shirk responsibility is impossible.

    are obviously times when you get things wrong due to circumstances you couldn’t
    anticipate or even the actions of others, and expressing those things is a valid
    thing to do, but it can be seen as trying to side-step responsibility. The best
    advice I can give here is that it’s okay to say “Yes, I got X wrong, but it’s
    because of factors Y and Z” as long as you follow that with “but it doesn’t matter
    because here’s what I’m going to do to correct the situation”. That tells people
    that yes, maybe you didn’t perform perfectly, but there were external factors.

    you’ll have someone directing your work. But, as the saying goes, idle hands are

    to be a better path in terms of employment simply because you won’t be artificially

    having a certain level of intellectual maturity. No one typically enjoys being
    wrong or having their ideas deemed less worthy than others, but that’s the way
    the world works, and you must accept it. The best advice I can offer is to try
    your best to keep emotion out of the proceedings. That, and try not to get emotionally
    attached to your ideas. As long as everyone is on a level playing field and comes

    Obviously, that means no one can see anything until much later in the process,
    not even a partially-built system for a long time. Second—and this is perhaps
    the bigger issue—is that no matter how good your documentation process is, people
    often don’t know what they need! Or they sometimes realize things they didn’t
    specify correctly up front as the product is developed, as they see parts of it

    be using the product don’t see anything until it’s done, or at least mostly done,
    at which point making changes, especially those that represent core changes to
    things underpinning the entire product, are very costly or even impossible sometimes.
    If it takes a year to document everything and then another year to build it, no
    one is seeing if the documentation matches reality until close to two years later,
    at which point making changes may not be possible, so now you spent all that time,
    money, and effort and wound up with something that doesn’t meet the needs for

    a project’s timeline and makes things a bit more predictable. However, it largely

    Agile, which is to be adaptive to changes. This is accomplished by developing
    small units and pieces of the larger project and critically getting that in front
    of people as soon as possible. That way, if the design wasn’t right, either because
    the business owners didn’t know exactly what they needed, the developer misunderstood
    a requirement, or whatever reason, only two weeks of effort was lost (and in most
    cases, it wasn’t completely lost). You can re-work the screen, iteratively, until
    it’s what is needed, all along adapting to any changes in requirements needed.

    is why I justify this discussion of development methodologies, mainly Agile, as
    a “soft skill”. I acknowledge I’m stretching the definition a bit here, but I
    think I can get away with it because Agile doesn’t work if you aren’t working
    hand-in-hand with people! If you aren’t constantly communicating and having a
    back-and-forth exchange of ideas, then Agile falls apart, and doing those things
    are soft skills in my book for sure.

- en: By the same token, customer feedback during the development process is a key
    component of making this work. The way this is accomplished with Agile is in iterations
    called **sprints**. I’ll get into more detail about sprints in the next section,
    but in short for now, they are a period of time—let’s say two weeks—where a small
    increment of work is done. Maybe during a given sprint, you implement one or two
    features out of the fifty you ultimately need, for example. The goal is to have
    something that can be deployed and ideally used for real at the end of every sprint
    so that customers can get immediate benefit from what you’re building as you go,
    even if not the full benefit of the full project being completed. They can then
    get hands-on experience and see where what was developed might not have been what
    they really needed, and that can feed back into the process and impact what you
    work on in the next sprint. Note that deploying after each sprint is definitely
    not a requirement of Agile, but the goal is that you *could* deploy at the end
    of every sprint.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the other benefits of Agile is that testing is done throughout the process
    by necessity. As a screen is built, it can be tested while another is being built.
    Unlike with Waterfall, where testing is almost entirely done at the end, you again
    don’t need to wait to find out things are wrong in Agile until the end as with
    Waterfall.

- en: Agile also shifts the focus—and to a large degree, control—onto the development
    team. It is typical for there to be a **backlog** of tickets; that is, a list
    of tasks to be accomplished. This backlog can be *groomed* by the stakeholders,
    meaning it can be arranged in priority order (usually, the tickets at the top
    of the backlog have been deemed most important). Ultimately, the development team
    decides what gets done in each sprint, pulling tickets from the backlog during
    **sprint planning** sessions. There, they estimate each ticket and then decide
    how many tickets they believe can be done in the next sprint. Sometimes not all
    tickets will get done, and sometimes extra time will be available, at which point
    the next ticket from the backlog can be added to the sprint on the fly. Sometimes,
    the order of the backlog might be ignored for various reasons (for example, if
    there is a ticket that the team knows will be easy to do further down on the backlog,
    but they want to pull it into the sprint just to fill it up a bit).

    there still is documentation in most cases, but it’s built on the fly, along with
    the code to a large extent. It also often lives in the tickets used for each piece
    built rather than being separate artifacts, though that depends on how a given
    organization implements Agile. And that’s a common thread here: there’s more than
    one way to do Agile, no truly canonical “right” way. Teams will tweak aspects
    of it to meet their needs. In my projects, we tend to favor four-week sprints,
    for example. Some teams don’t do sprint review sessions (meetings after a sprint
    ends where you present your work to the stakeholders, discuss what went right
    and wrong during a sprint and what to do to improve the next one) while others
    do them religiously. It’s all fungible.'

    usually know at the start how many sprints will be required, nor will you have
    a clear picture of what you’re building necessarily beyond some basics. If it
    sounds like chaos, it can be! But it’s controlled chaos, and it’s chaos that allows
    working code to get in front of people sooner, which is probably the primary benefit
    of Agile.

    of time—typically two weeks—where development is done. What usually happens is
    people design a small part of the application, perhaps a single screen out of
    many. This produces some degree of documentation as the designers and/or analysts
    write *just* enough documentation about only the specific tasks in the sprint
    that technical people need to implement it but far less than is typical with Waterfall.

    in some cases, is quite literal—the idea is to keep this meeting very short and
    sweet, and people tend to do that when they’re standing up. During it, each person
    goes around and quickly discusses what they worked on yesterday, what they plan
    to work on today, and if they have any blockers or issues that are keeping them
    from progressing (which the leader of the standup, the **scrum master**, will
    try to help unblock by connecting them with the right person to address the issue).

    Agile development, and it is probably the most predominant form, to the point
    where people tend to use the terms interchangeably. The main difference is that
    while Agile is a set of general philosophies and approaches to software development,
    Scrum refines Agile into specific roles (such as scrum master), specific ceremonies
    to perform (such as daily standups), and specific artifacts, such as the sprint
    backlog, which I’ll talk about shortly. Other forms of Agile are sometimes used
    though, including extreme programming and lean software development. So, keep
    in mind that Agile isn’t the same thing as Scrum, but also keep in mind that in
    most cases, owing to its popularity, Agile and Scrum can be used interchangeably
    in polite conversation.

    and the design details would be included. Then, the sprint begins, and a developer
    “picks up” that ticket to work on. Over the next two weeks, they develop it, often
    going back and forth with the designer (sometimes a business analyst). But ultimately,
    at the end of that two-week sprint, the goal is that the screen—and that screen

    of work remaining, most typically either tickets or **story points**, which are
    an estimate of how relatively difficult and time-consuming a ticket is (a ticket
    estimated at 10 story points should, generally speaking, be deemed twice as hard
    and time-consuming as one estimated at 5 story points).

    sprint and may adapt to changes more than you would with Waterfall alone.

    is ready to be released completely or releasing it after each sprint.

    end of development to show the customers what you’ve built as with Waterfall,

    only show them what you’ve built at predefined checkpoints. For example, if you
    have one hundred screens to build, you may group them into discrete pieces of
    functionality, where each group is maybe a dozen screens, and use each group as
    a checkpoint to show what you’ve built.

    involves some form of risk, be that loss of time or loss of money if the end product
    doesn’t meet the needs of the client. This risk is greater for Agile generally
    because, unlike Waterfall, there isn’t as much focus spent on specifying everything
    properly at the start. But, doing *some* of that work upfront before beginning
    an Agile project can help cut down some of that risk since you’re more likely
    to catch fundamental problems at that point, the type of problems that tend to
    be more difficult and costly to fix later. For the same reason, the ability of
    Agile to respond to changes more efficiently means that there isn’t as much risk
    of discovering issues in the middle that put the entire project at risk as there
    can be with Waterfall.

    because it’s mixing two methodologies, it’s probably even more important to customize
    the methodology according to the team’s needs and desires, where the team means
    the development team plus stakeholders. Part of this customization too is ensuring
    that the methodology aligns with the culture of the organization. Some companies
    are inherently more flexible while others are more rigid, so it makes sense that
    you would have to tailor your hybrid approach to align with that overall corporate
    mindset.
