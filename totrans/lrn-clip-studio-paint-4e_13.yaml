    in real life, except that they’re digital—and they can be customized and made
    to produce certain special effects easily, such as all lines going to a specific
    focal point (or even curving to a specific focal point). If you draw or ink in
    the digital realm, you want to make sure you’re familiar with these amazing tools.

    line** sub tool from the **Direct draw** tool group, and then click and drag.
    And it’s done! It’s quite a simple task. But when you want to create one with
    a textured brush, you need a ruler to guide you to create a straight line, no
    matter how steady your hand moves are. Alternatively, if you are going for a three-vanishing
    point perspective drawing, you need an accurate guide! Yes, there are good ruler

    clearly show actions, as well as the point on which the reader should focus their
    attention, hence the striking linework. One way that many manga artists do this
    is by using parallel lines to show motion, as well as radial lines to lead the
    reader’s eyes to the point of interest in a frame or, in some cases, to express
    the impact of objects hitting each other. Clip Studio Paint comes with rulers
    ready to make parallel and radial lines, making the process of creating these
    effects much easier than with pen and paper.

    selected. The currently selected ruler will show the control handles. In Figure
    13.37, the control handles are the circular and diamond-shaped icons around the
    ruler that allow us to edit it and change its shape and rotation.

    it is located just to the right of the center of the circle ruler. Click on the
    diamond-shaped control handle to make the ruler inactive. The ruler will change
    colors from purple to green, as shown in Figure 13.38.

    ruler. In Figure 13.39 showing the Fisheye perspective ruler, all upper vanishing
    points have been made inactive so that tools will only snap to the center vanishing
    point.

- en: Many new users of Clip Studio Paint don’t know that the software comes with
    a customizable grid that can be shown or hidden, or that you can create guides
    in the program as well. Grids and guidelines are handy for many tasks, of course,
    and provide a visual measurement that is easy to count and divide. Also, the grids
    and guidelines in Clip Studio Paint can be snapped to, making it very easy to
    get elements lined up precisely as they need to be.

    lines are our grid lines. Between each grid line are three grid-dividing lines
    that break each larger square of the grid up into four sections in each direction,
    giving a total of 16 squares between each line of the grid.

    be set. By default, it is set to the top left, meaning that the grid will appear
    with its start point in the top-left corner of the canvas. The other options for
    the point of origin are **Top right**, **Center**, **Bottom left**, and **Bottom
    right**. There is also an option to set a **Custom** point of origin. Clicking
    the radio button next to the **Custom** option will activate the text entry box,
    and custom values for the number of offset pixels for both the width and height
    of the document can be set. For instance, if a value of **10** is entered in **W**
    and a value of **20** in the **H** setting, then the point of origin for the grid
    will be 10 pixels in from the left side and 20 pixels down.

    be set. **Gap** is the space between the grid lines, which is set to **100** pixels
    in the preceding screenshot. **Number of divisions** is the setting for how many
    times the larger grid lines should be divided. Setting this to a higher number
    will result in smaller squares occurring in the grid overall because of the additional
    divisions.

    Paint, as well as the radial, parallel, and symmetry rulers. We created one-point,
    two-point, and three-point perspective rulers and learned how to use the direct
    drawing tools with them. We learned how to make rulers active or inactive and
    how to use the snapping settings. Finally, we learned about grids and guides.
    In this chapter, you gained skills such as creating various rulers by yourself;
    manipulating and using perspective rulers, and using them with Figure tools; and
    using grids and guides, organized per your requirements. Background drawings won’t
    scare you anymore now that you know about rulers.
