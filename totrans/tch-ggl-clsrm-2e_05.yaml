- en: Now that your online classroom is set up in Google Classroom and your students
    are enrolled in their classes, you can begin using Google Classroom's features
    to communicate with your students. One of the simplest forms of communicating
    with students within your classroom is to send **announcements**. Announcements
    in Google Classroom is like sending your class an email (in fact, when you create
    an announcement, students also receive an email containing the necessary information).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For announcements, you can add files from your computer or Google Drive, and
    even add links to websites or YouTube videos, just like we did with the **Material**
    post in **Classwork**, which we discussed in [*Chapter 1*](B16846_01_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013),
    *Getting to Know Google Classroom*. Students can even reply to your announcements
    directly from the classroom's **Stream**. An **Announcement** is a type of post
    that appears in this **Stream**. Using announcements in Google Classroom instead
    of sending emails also makes it easier to find announcements in the future and
    use them in other classes.
