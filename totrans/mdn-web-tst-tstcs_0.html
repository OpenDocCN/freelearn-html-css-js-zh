			<p>TestCafe is a self-sufficient, free, and open source end-to-end testing framework that combines unmatched ease of use with advanced automation and robust built-in stability mechanisms. It can be used to write fast and reliable tests.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Modern Web Testing with TestCafe</em> is a comprehensive, project-based introduction for those who are new to TestCafe. You'll build a suite of end-to-end tests while learning the core methods and concepts along the way.</p>
			<p>You'll learn how to write end-to-end tests using the TestCafe syntax, and the features of the TestCafe framework. You'll go from setting up the environment all the way to writing production-ready tests. Throughout the book, we'll build a sample set of tests step by step that will log in to the website, verify the elements present on different pages, create/delete entities, and execute custom JavaScript code, using TestCafe. Additionally, there will be several stages of refactoring, to showcase setup/teardown and PageObjects. While this test suite is relatively simple to build, it allows some of the most prominent features of TestCafe to be showcased. Additionally, it demonstrates the running of the tests against a free and simple-to-use website, and it does not require readers to build and deploy their own servers or backend services.</p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you will know how to write and enhance end-to-end tests with TestCafe in order to solve real-world problems and deliver results. You'll also have a proof of concept to demonstrate to others.</p>
