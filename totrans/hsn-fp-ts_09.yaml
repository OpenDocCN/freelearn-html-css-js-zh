  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Functional programming and reactive programming should be considered as two
    different paradigms. Functional programming focuses on the interpretation of functions
    as mathematical functions—stateless and without side effects. On the other hand,
    reactive programming focuses on the propagation of changes as streams of events.
    The term *functional-reactive programming* is used to refer to a superset of reactive
    programming. Functional-reactive programming tries to take advantage of both the
    functional and reactive programming paradigms. For example, in functional-reactive
    programming, the event streams can be composed, we are encouraged to avoid external
    state mutations, and many of the functional programming principles are still relevant.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Functional-reactive programming is highly influenced by the functional programming
    principles and, as a result, many of the benefits of functional programming are
    also shared by functional-reactive programming. Functional-reactive applications
    are easier to reason about because they tend to avoid state mutations and side
    effects and promote a declarative style. They are particularly well suited for
    event-based architectures and concurrent systems. Functional-reactive programming
    is also considered by many developers a programming style that tends to be scalable
    because it follows the principle of composability.

    stream of values. For example, a mouse click event can be represented as a stream
