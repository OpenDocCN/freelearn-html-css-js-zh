- en: Puppeteer is a multi-purpose browser automation tool created by Google. You
    will see Puppeteer being used in many different ways. It's used for web scraping,
    task automation, content generation, web monitoring, and UI testing.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book focuses on UI testing, but we won't stop there. For instance, we have
    a chapter focused on content generation and another chapter that focuses on web
    scraping. If you read this book from cover to cover, you will be able to use Puppeteer
    in all fields.

    that really motivated me: I wanted this book to cover the entire Puppeteer API.
    By the end of this book, you''ll have learned about the whole Puppeteer API.'

    with Puppeteer*, lays the foundation for the book. It will help you get started
    with Puppeteer by introducing you to the tool and getting you acquainted with
    the essentials. You will also learn how to write async code in JavaScript.'

    and Test runners*, covers end-to-end testing fundamentals and the difference between
    different types of tests. In the latter part of the chapter, we will cover creating
    and organizing a test project and getting started with test runners.'

    through a website*, sees you start coding your tests. You will learn how to launch
    a browser, navigate to a page, and make some assertions. Then, you will see how
    to publish your tests to the cloud to be tested.'

    with a page,* is all about interaction. Once you get to a page, how do you test
    it? How do you simulate user interaction? This chapter takes you through the most
    common ways of interacting with a page. This chapter also covers some basic HTML
    concepts, so you can take advantage of all the tools Puppeteer provides.'

    elements and network calls,* teaches you how to wait for the different scenarios
    on the page you are testing—waiting for the page to load and be ready, waiting
    for a button to be enabled, waiting for an Ajax call to be completed, and so on.
    This chapter covers all the tools that Puppeteer offers to handle these scenarios.'

    need to be an expert. All the examples will run on Node.js. If you have experience
    with this framework, you will find it easier to get started. If you don't, don't
    worry; we won't go deep into Node.js*.*

    or Linux. In [*Chapter 1*](B16113_01_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014), *Getting
    started with Puppeteer*, we will see how to install Node.js and Visual Studio
    Code. If you already have these tools installed, notice that Puppeteer relies

- en: Many of the examples of this book will be based on real websites that most of
    us use every day. We are going to test websites like [GitHub.com](http://GitHub.com),
    [StackOverlow.com](http://StackOverlow.com), The Weather Channel, and PacktPub.
    That means that you will learn how to automate real websites using the latest
    technologies. However, this also means that some of the code examples might eventually
    fail. This could be due to network conditions, problems with the server, or a
    website redesign. However, our main aim is that you can learn the concepts and
    apply them to your own solutions besides these changes.
