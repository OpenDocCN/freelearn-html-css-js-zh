    to add the version number of the plugin. It's possible for you to have to add
    more and more update sites over time for the same plugin. And if there is a new
    major version of the Subclipse plugin, there will also be a new update site location
    that you'll have to add. So, prevent confusion between similar plugins, and always
    specify a name that identifies your update site clearly. You could even use the
    URL directly as the label.![Time for action – installing a third-party plugin](img/8246_01_10.jpg)
