    is one of the necessary evils for teachers. There is never time during the day
    to mark all the assignments students turn in. Therefore, we teachers also have
    constant homework, where we are marking assignments at home. Thankfully, Google
    Classroom and other Google Apps help reduce the time it takes to grade and return
    assignments. Not to mention, this reduces your environmental impact by reducing
    the paper use within your classroom.

- en: Depending on the type of assignments you're working with, there will be times
    where you may want to give feedback on the assignment's completion process, as
    well as the results. One example is to determine whether a student has modified
    the data that's been collected from an investigation after processing the data
    to calculate a more accurate result. Formally called **Revision history**, Version
    history takes snapshots of a Google Doc as content is added. It is a digital paper
    trail that allows you and your students to view previous versions of the document.

    with circles, arrows, and scribbles. Using a pen-enabled tablet, such as the Apple
    iPad with an Apple Pencil or a Samsung Galaxy Tab S tablet with an S-Pen, yields
    a more enjoyable experience in comparison to using a tablet with a third-party
    silicon tip stylus.

    within Google Classroom. Then, you enhanced those features with the commenting
    and suggesting features found within Google Docs. Next, you learned about Google
    Doc's **Version history**, which you can use to view previous snapshots of a Google
    Doc.

    learned how to create and grade assignments with a rubric. Additional methods
    of creating a rubric by reusing one or importing a Google Sheet were also explored.

    tablet and the Google Classroom app, which creates PDFs of your annotations on
    the Google Doc. This is akin to traditional paper marking techniques.

    assignments, it is important that you take the time to evaluate which methods
    work best in your assessment workflow. You do not need to use each method to provide
    effective feedback and often, less is more. After assessing a handful of assignments
    with your preferred method, it will become more natural and intuitive.

    into quizzes that Google Classroom can grade.
