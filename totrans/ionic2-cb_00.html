Ionic is intended to fill that gap, with its open source HTML5 mobile app framework that lets developers build native-feeling apps using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and AngularJS. Ionic makes it easy for frontend developers to become app developers. The framework provides superior performance with deep Cordova integration and a comprehensive set of tools for prototyping, backend support, and deployment.</p><p>This book will take you through the process of developing a cross-platform mobile app using just HTML5 and Javascript based on Ionic 2, which is the latest version of Ionic using the Angular 2 framework. You will start by getting familiar with the CLI and learning how to build and run an app. You will touch on common features of real-world mobile applications, such as authenticating a user, getting data, and saving data using either Firebase or local storage. Next, the book will explain how Ionic integrates with Cordova to support native device features using ngCordova and take advantage of the existing modules around its ecosystem. You will also explore advanced topics of extending Ionic to create new components. Finally, the book will show you how to customize the Ionic theme and build an app for all platforms.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
