It helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3 allows great control over the final visual result, and it is the hottest and most powerful web-based data visualization technology on the market today.</p><p>D3 v4 is the latest release of the D3 library. This second edition cookbook has been completely updated to cover and leverage the D3 v4 API, modular data structure, as well as revamped force implemented. It is designed to provide you with all the guidance you need to get to grips with data visualization with D3. With this book, you will create breathtaking data visualization with professional efficiency and precision with the help of practical recipes, illustrations, and code samples.</p><p>This cookbook starts off by touching upon data visualization and D3 basics before gradually taking you through a number of practical recipes covering a wide range of topics you need to know about D3.</p><p>You will learn the fundamental concepts of data visualization, functional JavaScript, and D3 fundamentals, including element selection, data binding, animation, and SVG generation. You will also learn how to leverage more advanced techniques such as interpolators, custom tweening, timers, queueing, hierarchy, force manipulation, and so on. This book also provides a number of pre-built chart recipes with ready-to-go sample code to help you bootstrap quickly.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf07lvl1sec1"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Getting Started with D3.js">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Getting Started with D3.js,</em> is designed to get you up and running with D3.js, covering fundamental aspects, such as what D3.js is, and how to set up a typical D3.js data visualization environment.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Be Selective">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Be Selective</em>, covers one of the most fundamental tasks you need to perform with any data visualization project using D3: selection. Selection helps you target certain visual elements on the page.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Dealing with Data">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Dealing with Data,</em> explores the most essential question in any data visualization project: how to represent data in both programming constructs and its visual metaphor.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Tipping the Scales">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Tipping the Scales</em>, covers the  one key task that you need to perform over and over again as a data visualization developer, that is, mapping values in your data domain to visual domain, which is the focus of this chapter.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Playing with Axes">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Playing with Axes</em>, explores the usage of the axes component and some related techniques commonly used in the visualization based on the Cartesian coordinates system.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Transition with Style">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Transition with Style</em>, deals with a saying that is arguably one of the most important cornerstones of data visualization, "a picture is worth a thousand words." This chapter covers transition and animation support provided by the D3 library.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Getting into Shape">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Getting into Shape</em>,  deals with <strong>Scalable Vector Graphic</strong> (<strong>SVG</strong>), which is a mature <strong>World Wide Web Consortium</strong> (<strong>W3C</strong>) standard widely used in visualization projects.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Chart Them Up">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Chart Them Up</em>, explores one of the oldest and trusted companions in data visualization: charts. Charts are a well-defined and well-understood graphical representation of data.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Lay Them Out">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Lay Them Out</em>, focuses on the D3 layout. D3 layouts are algorithms that calculate and generate placement information for a group of elements capable of generating some of the most complex and interesting visualizations.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Interacting with Your Visualization">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Interacting with Your Visualization</em>, focuses on D3 human visualization interaction support or, in other words, how to add computational steering capability to your visualization.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Using Force">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Using Force</em>, covers one of the most fascinating aspects of D3: force. Force simulation is one of the most awe-inspiring techniques that you can add to your visualization.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. Knowing Your Map">Chapter 12</a>, <em>Know Your Map,</em> introduces the basic D3 cartographic visualization techniques and how to implement a fully functional geographic visualization in D3.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. Test Drive Your Visualization">Chapter 13</a>, <em>Test Drive Your Visualization</em>, guides you to implement your visualization like a pro with <strong>Test-Driven Development</strong> (<strong>TDD</strong>).</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch14.html" title="Chapter Appendix. Building Interactive Analytics in Minutes">Appendix A</a>, <em>Building Interactive Analytics in Minutes</em>, serves as an introduction to
Crossfilter.js and DC.js on interactive dimensional charting.
