    For instance, the backbone of a gauge chart is made up of a pane. A **pane** is
    a circular plot area for laying out chart content. We can adjust the size, position,
    and background of the pane. Once a pane is laid out, we can then put the axis
    on top of it. Highcharts supports multiple panes within a chart, so we can display
    multiple gauges (that is, multiple gauge series) within a chart. A gauge series
    is composed of two specific components—a pivot and a dial.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Another distinct difference in gauge charts is that the series is actually
    one dimensional data: a single value. Therefore, there is only one axis, the y
    axis, used in this type of chart. The `yAxis` properties are used the same way
    as other series type charts which can be on a `linear`, `datetime`, or `logarithmic`
    scale, and it also responds to the `tickInterval` option and so on.'

    the chart evolving gradually. The configuration declares a pane with a circular
    plot area from -120 to 120 degrees, with the y axis laying horizontally, whereas
    0 degrees is at the 12 o'clock position. The `rotation` option generally takes
    a numerical degree value; `'auto'` is the special keyword to enable the y axis
    labels to automatically rotate so that they are aligned with the pane angle. The
    little box below the dial is the default data label showing the current value

    differently compared to conventional charts. From a clockwise direction, we see
    the data line "spirals up" for an upward trend (Chrome) and "spirals down" for
    a downward trend (Internet Explorer), whereas the data line for Firefox doesn't
    show much movement. As for Safari and Opera, these series are essentially lost
    as they are completely invisible unless we enlarge the chart container, which
    is impractical. Another characteristic is that the last and first data points
    in the series are connected together. As a result, the Firefox series shows a
    closed loop and there is a sudden jump in the Internet Explorer series (the Chrome
    series is not connected because it has null values at the beginning of the series
    as the Chrome browser was not released until late 2008).

    are caused by the reverse order in the data pairs. Nonetheless, we won't know
    whether open is higher than close or vice versa. If we only want to know how wide
    the range between the **Open & Close** series is, then the preceding area range
    chart achieves the goal. By keeping them as separate series, there will be no
    such issue. In a nutshell, this is the subtle difference when plotting range series
    data with ambiguous meanings.

- en: The radial gradient setting is based on SVG. As its name implies, a **radial
    gradient** is color shading radiating outwards in a circular direction. Therefore,
    it requires three properties to define the gradient circle—`cx`, `cy`, and `r`.
    The gradient circle is the outermost circle for shading, such that no shading
    can go outside of this.
  id: totrans-116
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 径向渐变设置基于 SVG。正如其名所示，**径向渐变**是以圆形方向向外辐射的颜色阴影。因此，它需要三个属性来定义渐变圆——`cx`、`cy` 和 `r`。渐变圆是阴影的最外层圆，这样阴影就不会超出这个范围。
- en: 'All the gradient positions are defined in ratio values between zero and one
    with respect to their containing elements. The `cx` and `cy` options are at the
    x, y center position of the outermost circle, whereas `r` is the radius of the
    outmost circle. If `r` is 0.5, it means the gradient radius is half the diameter
    of its element, the same size as the containing pane. In other words, the gradient
    starts from the center and goes all the way to the edge of the gauge. The `stop`
    offsets option works the same way as the linear gradient: the first parameter
    is the ratio position in the gradient circle to stop the shading. This controls
    the intensity of shading between the colors. The shorter the gap, the higher the
    contrast between the colors.'

  zh: 所有渐变位置都是相对于其包含元素的比例值在零到一之间定义的。`cx` 和 `cy` 选项位于最外层圆的 x、y 中心位置，而 `r` 是最外层圆的半径。如果
    `r` 是 0.5，这意味着渐变半径是其元素直径的一半，与包含面板大小相同。换句话说，渐变从中心开始，一直延伸到仪表的边缘。`stop` 偏移选项与线性渐变的工作方式相同：第一个参数是渐变圆中停止阴影的比率位置。这控制了颜色之间的阴影强度。间隔越短，颜色之间的对比度越高。
