    book, the focus will be on AWS, which is often considered the best option with
    regards to features, costs, and reliability. As we need to use a large number
    of AWS services throughout the book, this chapter introduces them to help you
    to get familiar with the building blocks of our sample application.

    be ported to other clouds, but this won't be an easy task. As previously stated
    in [Chapter 1](41e30804-d6ff-4759-9388-5e8734fed26f.xhtml), *Understanding the
    Serverless Model*, one of the disadvantages of serverless is the vendor lock-in.
    However, you can use this book to learn the concepts and maybe mix services from
    different vendors. For example, you could use Azure Functions with Amazon SimpleDB.

    you benefit from a free tier ([https://aws.amazon.com/free](https://aws.amazon.com/free))

    It can create/delete and start/stop any service. That's great for learning, but
    you shouldn't use it when developing a real project. In information security,
    the principle of least privilege requires that a user or program must be able
    to access only the information or resources that are necessary for its legitimate
    purpose. In case your access keys are compromised, the damage will be reduced
    if the access scope is restricted.

    set an A record (IP address) or CNAME (alias to another address), but the root
    domain (`mydomain.com`) requires an A record. If you host your frontend using
    S3, you receive an endpoint to set a CNAME record, but you don't get a fixed IP
    to set an A record. Since Route 53 is an AWS service, it accepts an S3 endpoint
    in the A record option and solves this issue.

    with the objective of improving your website speed and availability. It achieves
    this by reducing the distance between users and files using Amazon's infrastructure

    them can be used to host copies of your files.

    takes 53 milliseconds. A ping message needs a roundtrip, covering twice the distance
    and taking double the time. Also, there are other factors that increase this time:
    light travels 33% slower on fiber optics (glass), there is no straight line connecting
    both cities, and equipment like repeaters and switches will slow down transfer
    speeds. The result is a measured latency between 200 milliseconds and 300 milliseconds.
    By comparison, providing the content in the same city may reduce the latency to
    15 milliseconds.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This difference is usually not significant for most applications. In a serverless
    website, the cold start delay has a bigger impact. If your use case is very sensitive
    to high latencies, you should avoid serverless or you can use CloudFront to minimize
    the impact, at least in the frontend.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To reduce costs, CloudFront won't replicate your content automatically throughout
    the world. It will replicate only where a demand for it exists. For example, when
    a request is made from a British city, the DNS will route the request to the nearest
    edge location and if it does not have yet a local copy of the file, it will be
    copied temporarily (cached). When another user in a nearby city requests the same
    file, it will benefit from a lower latency and fast response.

    ISO representation to avoid localization issues and to be able to make the `where`
    clauses. If you want to store numbers, use zero-padding. And how can we make `where`
    clauses with negative numbers? It is done by adding a large offset to all numbers
    to avoid storing negatives! As you can see, building a system on top of SimpleDB

- en: Fortunately, AWS has a permanent free tier that is very generous. You can serve
    more than 100 million read/write requests per month for free and this offer is
    not restricted to new AWS users. Considering this advantage, the low price to
    grow your user base, the possibility to automate the throughput provisioning,
    DynamoDB is a good choice for most serverless applications and this is proven
    by the numerous examples of projects and demos created by the serverless community
    using DynamoDB. It is very hard to see SimpleDB being used even for small projects,
    since DynamoDB is free for low usage.

- en: So, even if you have a large project and end up having to pay for provisioned
    resources that you would not use, DynamoDB requires much less management and can
    be a cheaper option than running a traditional database solution. For all these
    reasons, we are going to cover SimpleDB usage in this book, but our sample application
    will run on DynamoDB.
