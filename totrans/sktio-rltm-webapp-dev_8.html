This book focuses on building a chat system with socket.io, Node.js, and Express.js. But what if your primary platform of choice is not Node.js or you are working on a project where you want the same capabilities as provided by socket.io but cannot as you have an existing standardized platform and cannot bring a new system in the equation. Many before you have faced the same dilemma and in the spirit of open source, socket.io servers exist for various platforms. In this appendix let's take a look at the various implementations available for socket.io backends<a id="id263" class="indexterm"/>.</p><p>Every platform will require you to apply the learning and logic from this book to rewrite the server-side code targeting that platform. The client code can continue to be the same.</p><p>The following is an alphabetic list of the implementations by their languages/platforms:</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec56"/>Erlang</h1></div></div></div><a id="id264" class="indexterm"/><p>There are two different backends for socket.io on erlang, Yurii Rashkovskii's <strong>socket.io-erlang</strong>
<a id="id265" class="indexterm"/> (<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/yrashk/socket.io-erlang">https://github.com/yrashk/socket.io-erlang</a>) and Yongboy's <strong>erlang-socketio</strong>
<a id="id266" class="indexterm"/>(<a class="ulink" href="https://code.google.com/p/erlang-scoketio/">https://code.google.com/p/erlang-scoketio/</a>).</p><p>Yurii seems to have a disagreement with the path taken by socket.io's post-0.6.x releases, and so the library supports only up to Version 0.6 of the spec. Naturally, most of the examples in this book and many other examples on the Internet, won't work over it.</p><p>Yongboy's erlang-socketio seems to be keeping itself up to date with the latest happenings in socket.io and is compatible with the latest spec for socket.io-1.0 at the time of writing. Thus we will focus the rest of this section on this library.</p><p>This library is available for <a id="id267" class="indexterm"/>
<strong>Cowboy</strong> and <strong>Mochiweb</strong>
<a id="id268" class="indexterm"/>, two popular server-side frameworks in erlang. Both these versions support socket.io spec 1.0. The Cowboy version supports all the transports, while the Mochiweb version is limited to <code class="literal">xhr-polling</code>, <code class="literal">htmlfile</code>, and <code class="literal">json-polling</code>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec57"/>Google Go</h1></div></div></div><p>
<strong>Go</strong>
<a id="id269" class="indexterm"/> is a language in its early years, but is gaining popularity, mainly due to the corporate backing from Google and being one of the three languages supported on the Google App Engine, beside Python and Java.</p><p>The <code class="literal">go-socket.io</code> implementation provides socket.io support on Go. This project supports almost all the transports and also supports socket.io on Google's App Engine. The original codebase for this project is at <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/madari/go-socket.io">https://github.com/madari/go-socket.io</a>, but the development there has stagnated for a while; but others seem to have taken up the torch. The socket.io wiki points to this fork:<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/davies/go-socket.io">https://github.com/davies/go-socket.io</a>.</p><p>One thing to notice here is that this codebase still doesn't support versions higher than 0.6.x.</p><p>Check out the forks created in github and you will find interesting developments being done to the code. Like this fork, which was updated much more recently:<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/justinfx/go-socket.io">https://github.com/justinfx/go-socket.io</a>.</p><p>If you want to use a newer version of socket.io, the fork at <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/murz/go-socket.io">https://github.com/murz/go-socket.io</a> should support versions up to 0.8.x (this was at the time of writing).</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec58"/>Java</h1></div></div></div><p>There are multiple implementations available for socket.io on a Java server. Let's take a look at them.</p><p>The first is <strong>Socket.IO-Java</strong>
<a id="id270" class="indexterm"/>, maintained most actively at <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/Ovea/Socket.IO-Java">https://github.com/Ovea/Socket.IO-Java</a>. It has been forked and modified to work with various servers and platforms.</p><p>Then there is <strong>Atmosphere</strong>. 
<a id="id271" class="indexterm"/> Atmosphere began as a project to bring server push to glassfish servers, but was spun off as a project of its own and works with almost any Java server. Atmosphere server comes with atmosphere.js, which is its own JS client, but any Atmosphere application will work with a socket.io client out of the box, without any modification; use <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere/wiki/Getting-Started-with-Socket.IO">https://github.com/Atmosphere/atmosphere/wiki/Getting-Started-with-Socket.IO</a> to get started with Atmosphere,. If you are starting a new java project or are introducing push in your existing java one, don't make a decision until you have taken a look at Atmosphere.</p><p>
<strong>Netty</strong>
<a id="id272" class="indexterm"/> brings an asynchronous server to Java; and very important to mention is Yongboy's <strong>socket</strong>
<strong>io-netty</strong>
<a id="id273" class="indexterm"/> (<a class="ulink" href="http://code.google.com/p/socketio-netty/">http://code.google.com/p/socketio-netty/</a>). It is highly recommended due to the async nature of netty, which is more suited for these applications.</p><p>
<strong>Gisio</strong>
<a id="id274" class="indexterm"/> (<a class="ulink" href="https://bitbucket.org/c58/gnisio/wiki/Home">https://bitbucket.org/c58/gnisio/wiki/Home</a>) brings socket.io to the GWT framework, the Google's write-in-Java-and-compile-to-JS library. So if your application is built in GWT and you want to introduce server-push in your application, you can use this library.</p><p>And for the new and upcoming completely asynchronous server <strong>Vert.x</strong>
<a id="id275" class="indexterm"/>, there is <strong>mo</strong>
<strong>d-socket-io</strong>
<a id="id276" class="indexterm"/> (<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/keesun/mod-socket-io">https://github.com/keesun/mod-socket-io</a>) Again, if you are looking at an application of a highly asynchronous nature, I would suggest you to take a look at this server and this module.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec59"/>Perl</h1></div></div></div><p>Perl may be a very old<a id="id277" class="indexterm"/> language, but is still used in many places, and it has an actively maintained socket.io server module called <strong>pocketio</strong>
<a id="id278" class="indexterm"/> (<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/vti/pocketio">https://github.com/vti/pocketio</a>).</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec60"/>Python</h1></div></div></div><p>Python is another <a id="id279" class="indexterm"/>language that is gaining wide acceptance and popularity. And there are multiple socket.io server implementations for Python.</p><p>The first we look at is <strong>gevent-socket.io</strong>
<a id="id280" class="indexterm"/> (<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/abourget/gevent-socketio">https://github.com/abourget/gevent-socketio</a>), which works with any WSGI-based web frameworks. So if you are using any framework such as Pyramid, Pylons, Flask, and Django, this will work for you. The only dependencies are <strong>gevent</strong>
<a id="id281" class="indexterm"/>
 and <strong>gevent-websocket</strong>.<a id="id282" class="indexterm"/>
</p><p>If Tornado is your framework of choice, take a look at <strong>Tornadio 2</strong>
<a id="id283" class="indexterm"/> (<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/MrJoes/tornadio2">https://github.com/MrJoes/tornadio2</a>), which provides support for socket.io Versions 0.7 and higher. Again, Tornado is an asynchronous framework and good for such applications.</p><p>And dedicated to bringing socket.io to Django is <strong>django-socketio</strong>
<a id="id284" class="indexterm"/> (<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/stephenmcd/django-socketio">https://github.com/stephenmcd/django-socketio</a>).</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch06lvl1sec61"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter we saw the socket.io backend implementations for some popular platforms. If you are using some other platform, just search for a socket.io server implementation on the Internet and I am sure you will find one. It may not be the best or in an ideal state, but you definitely will find a solution to get started.</p></div></body></html>
