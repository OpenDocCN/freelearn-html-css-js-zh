    we want to deliver. I will recommend some ideas that we can use immediately for
    our creation. The first idea is character theme colors. It’s great fun to come
    up with the most suitable theme color for each character. We especially need this
    when we are creating a color manga as characters need to be distinguishable immediately
    on a page. This is a particularly good idea because, by the time we get to creating
    character merchandise, we can have even more fun designing with their theme colors!

    behind the artwork. For example, we don’t use primary colors when we want to create
    a romantic atmosphere but tend to use them to express danger or thrill instead.
    The samples in *Figure 15.2* are art with different color combos.

    of using colors. You can also try it by studying colors from your favorite art/photo
    and drawing with them on your art. By the way, all the above sample artworks were
    created using Clip Studio Paint, using its color palettes, which will be introduced

    it in the *Exploring layer blending modes* section in the next chapter of this
    book. Another tip is that the colors of objects closer to the camera tend to be
    warmer and more reddish, and those farther away tend to be cooler and blueish.

    that are most used are the **Color Wheel**, **Color Slider**, and **Color Set**
    palettes. Each palette gives us a different way to make just about any color we
    can imagine in our digital illustrations and comics. Let’s take a look at each
    of these palettes and how to use them to pick colors in the following sections.

    shows the pure hue (chosen from the outer circle). As we move up and to the left,
    the color becomes lighter and closer to pure white. As we move down and to the
    left, the color becomes darker and closer to pure black. By clicking inside of
    the triangle, we can choose any saturation or luminosity of the currently chosen
    hue.

    palette. The upper-right corner of the square shows the pure hue. By moving toward
    the lower-right corner, the color becomes darker and closer to black. The top-left
    corner is pure white and choosing a color close to it makes the color lighter
    in value. Going toward the lower-left corner makes the color less saturated (grayer)
    and closer to black.

    is the RGB mode. Each slider in this mode controls a different amount of color.
    The top slider controls the amount of red in the current color, the middle slider
    controls the amount of green, and the bottom slider controls the amount of blue.
    The swatches along the bottom of the palette window are the current foreground
    and background colors, as well as our trusty transparent swatch.

    mode from the Color Wheel palette, but instead of a wheel and square, we have
    sliders to control each aspect of the color selection.

    for **Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black** and these are the colors used in printing
    color images on paper. Although we cannot set our document to be in CMYK mode,
    we can choose colors based on CMYK values using these color sliders to control
    the amount of each color present.

    is being used. For instance, setting both the horizontal and vertical axes to
    **Hue** and setting both slider values to **100%** produces lots of very saturated
    colors when a similarly saturated color is the currently active color. *Figure
    15.18* shows what the **Approximate Color** palette looks like when a saturated
    purple color is chosen and the horizontal and vertical axes are set to **Hue**.

    from scenery photos you have taken of the sky with golden clouds or a dark forest,
    you can, of course, use them as a palette!

- en: In this chapter, we began to explore the wonderful world of color. Color is
    a complex subject, and many studies can be done on using it effectively, but by
    using the tools and palettes in Clip Studio Paint, we can make it a little bit
    easier to handle. We learned how to use the Color Wheel, Color Slider, and Color
    Set palettes. Then, we learned how to use the Color History, Intermediate Color,
    and Approximate Color, and Color Mixing palettes to track and mix our colors.
    Finally, we imported color swatches from Photoshop and learned how to select colors
    from the Sub View palette and imported color swatches from Photoshop. For certain,
    these functions will help you color your art in future creations, keep your favorite
    colors, or build beautiful color combinations.
