<span class="emphasis"><em>Collaborative work is an important topic at present. <a id="id511" class="indexterm"/>Many large projects are now being developed in a collaborative way. But this was not always easy for the developer. When many developers are working together on large projects, each developer must have a well-known area of work, and each developer must make sure that he doesn't interfere with the work of the other developers.</em></span>
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Without tools such as SVN or Git, large projects like jQuery or Linux Mint could not be possible. The developers of all these projects are distributed all over the world and they often work in different time zones and have different ways of working, but in the end all the parts are merged into one great project in SVN or Git.</em></span>
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>So, SVN and Git are a great enrichment for all developers and essential for the fast progress of large web projects.</em></span>
</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Let's take a look at how easy it is to work with SVN and Git in Aptana Studio.</em></span>
</p><p>In this chapter we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What views does the SVN perspective provide</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Checking out an SVN Repository</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Identifying files in different states within the Project Explorer</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Updating and committing an SVN project</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to read the SVN history, compare versions, and restore an older version</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Cloning a Git repository in order to receive a project</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Working with a local Git repository</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to stage, unstage, revert, and commit within Git Repositories</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Pushing and pulling remote Git Repositories</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Working with SVN"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec114"/>Working with SVN</h1></div></div></div><p>At first we will take a look at the <span class="strong"><strong>SVN</strong></span> perspective. We have already examined how to install the SVN plugin in <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Basics and How to Use Perspectives and Views">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Basics and How to Use Perspectives and Views</em></span>. If you haven't installed it yet, switch back to <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Basics and How to Use Perspectives and Views">Chapter 2</a> and install it.</p><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>SVN</strong></span> perspective provides a group of views that help <a id="id512" class="indexterm"/>us to work with a Subversion server. You can open this perspective by using the Perspective menu in the top-right of the Aptana Studio window.</p><p>The important and most frequently used views related to SVN, which we will take a look at, are the <span class="strong"><strong>SVN Repositories</strong></span> view, the <span class="strong"><strong>Team</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>History</strong></span> view, and the <span class="strong"><strong>SVN</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> view. These views are categorized as the views selection into the <span class="strong"><strong>SVN</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Team</strong></span> folder, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8246_09_01.jpg" alt="Working with SVN"/></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>SVN Repositories</strong></span> view allows you to add new repositories and manage all available repositories. Additionally, you have the option to create new tags or branches of the Repository. These views belong to the <span class="strong"><strong>SVN</strong></span> views, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8246_09_02.jpg" alt="Working with SVN"/></div><p>The <span class="strong"><strong>History</strong></span> view allows you to get an overview about the project and revisions history. This view is used by SVN and Git projects; for this reason the view is stored in the <span class="strong"><strong>Team</strong></span> views group. The <a id="id513" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>History</strong></span> view can be opened by the menu under <span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Show View</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>History</strong></span>. Here you can see all the revisions with their comments and data creation. Furthermore, you can get a view into all revisions of a file and you also have, the ability to compare all revisions. The following screenshot shows the <span class="strong"><strong>History</strong></span> view:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8246_09_06.jpg" alt="Working with SVN"/></div><p>Within the SVN <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> view, you will find the output from all the SVN actions that are executed by Aptana Studio. Therefore, if you have an <a id="id514" class="indexterm"/>SVN conflict or something else, you can take a look at this <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> view's output and you might locate the problem a bit faster. The <a id="id515" class="indexterm"/>SVN <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> view was automatically integrated in the Aptana Studio Console, while the SVN plugin was installed. So if you need the SVN <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> view, just open the general <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> view from <span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Show view</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span>. If the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> view is open, just use the View menu to select the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> type, which in this case is the <span class="strong"><strong>SVN Console</strong></span> entry.</p><p>The following screenshot shows the <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> view and how you can select <span class="strong"><strong>SVN Console</strong></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8246_09_07.jpg" alt="Working with SVN"/></div><p>However, before we can start work with SVN, we have to add the related SVN Repository.</p></div></div>

By using Git, you can only commit changes in the complete Repository at once. But for now, we want to commit our SVN Repository changes, therefore just follow the steps mentioned in the following <span class="emphasis"><em>Time for action – updating and committing an SVN Repository</em></span> section.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Time for action &#x2013; updating and committing an SVN Repository"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl1sec117"/>Time for action – updating and committing an SVN Repository</h1></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">The first step, before performing a <a id="id530" class="indexterm"/>commit, is to perform an update on your working copy. Therefore, we will start by doing this, Aptana Studio reads all new revisions from the Subversion server and merges them with your local working copy. In order to do this update, right-click on your project root and select <span class="strong"><strong>Team</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Update to HEAD</strong></span>.</li><li class="listitem">When your working copy is up to date, navigate to the <span class="strong"><strong>App Explorer</strong></span> view or the <span class="strong"><strong>Project Explorer</strong></span> view and right-click on the files or directories that you want to commit, and then select the <span class="strong"><strong>Commit...</strong></span> <a id="id531" class="indexterm"/>entry in the <span class="strong"><strong>Team</strong></span> option.<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8246_09_13.jpg" alt="Time for action – updating and committing an SVN Repository"/></div></li><li class="listitem">If you select a few directories or the whole project, the <span class="strong"><strong>Commit</strong></span> window lists only those files within the selection that have changed since the last commit. So, you are able to select just the files and directories that you want to commit. Compose the selected files and <a id="id532" class="indexterm"/>directories as you need, and enter a comment in the top of the window.<div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip50"/>Tip</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Why do you have to enter a comment while committing a change?</strong></span>
</p><p>Because, by committing the SVN Repository, it automatically saves the date, time, and your username; with this data the revision history stores information about <span class="emphasis"><em>who has changed which file at what time</em></span>. In addition to that comes the commenting part. The comment should describe what kind of changes were made and what is their purpose.</p></div></div></li><li class="listitem">To finalize the commit, you just have to click on the <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span> button and the commit process will start.</li><li class="listitem">As described previously, you can see the output from all your SVN processes within the SVN <span class="strong"><strong>Console</strong></span> view.

You can perform an update in a single file tree node. You don't have to update your whole project every time, a single node can also be committed.</p></div><div class="section" title="Updating an SVN Repository"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch09lvl2sec136"/>Updating an SVN Repository</h2></div></div></div><p>Additionally, similar to the SVN check out, you have the option to update your working copy not only to the Head revision, but <a id="id535" class="indexterm"/>also to a special revision number. In order to do this, right-click on the project root within the <span class="strong"><strong>Project Explorer</strong></span> view and select the <a id="id536" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Update to Head...</strong></span> option or the <span class="strong"><strong>Update to Version...</strong></span> option <a id="id537" class="indexterm"/>under the <span class="strong"><strong>Team</strong></span> tab. After selecting one of these entries, Aptana Studio determines all the new files and files to be updated, downloads them from the Repository, and merges them with your local working copy.</p><p>Now you should have all the source code from your current project. But, how can you identify which parts of a file are new or have been changed?</p><p>No problem! Aptana Studio allows you not only to compare two different local files,  you can also compare files from different revisions in your <a id="id538" class="indexterm"/>Repository. Refer to the following <span class="emphasis"><em>Time for action</em></span> section to understand how this works:</p></div></div>

By working with SVN Repositories you should know, in detail, how to add a new Repository and, how to check out the Repository into a project. After adding and checking out, you should know how to work with the SVN project. This means that you have to know how to commit your local changes, update your local working copy, and know how to use the SVN history for your work.</p><p>While working with Git, you have not only seen how to clone a remote Git Repository and work with it within a local project, but also how to create your own local Git Repository. Within your local Git Repository, we had a look at the commit process and how to stage, unstage, and revert files. Finally, we had a look at how to push and pull a Git Repository.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will learn how to work in an optimal way with PHP within Aptana Studio.</p></div></body></html>
