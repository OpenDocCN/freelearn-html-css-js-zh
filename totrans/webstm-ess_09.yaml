- en: While you are in a JavaScript debug session, WebStorm allows you to see all
    the changes that you make to any HTML file or any file that generates HTML, CSS,
    or JavaScript . When you are in this mode, you can also see the page structure
    and scripts in the **Elements** tab of the **Debug** section.

- en: Before we use the Live Edit mode, we need to make sure that the plugin is activated
    in the plugins settings page, and that the WebStorm browser extension is installed
    and activated. We've already used this in the debugging section.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For this section, we are going to use the project that we created in the Bootstrap
    example. So open the example, or create a new project from the GitHub repository
    at [https://github.com/srosca/webstorm_essentials_bootstrap.git](https://github.com/srosca/webstorm_essentials_bootstrap.git).
    Once you have all the necessary code, open the **Run/Debug Configurations** dialog
    from **Run** | **Edit Configurations…**, as shown in the following screenshot.
    Select JavaScript as the template, Bootstrap as the name, and `http://localhost:63369/webstorm_essentials_bootstrap/index.html`
    as the URL.

    the **Run** menu or the toolbar. With this session started, you have access to
    multiple tools that will help with the development of your project.

    your caret location, or when we shift click an element.

    both the editor window and the browser opens at the same time, and as you edit
    your code, the changes are reflected immediately.

    in the browser. WebStorm knows how to refresh all the changes we are making to
    HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, or any files that generate changes.

    scripts, loaded in the **Debug** section in the **Elements** Tab.

- en: The Live Edit mode is really useful from the developer's point of view, since
    he/she can quickly see how the changes affect the page, and is thus able to quickly
    debug and prototype the pages.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Emmet is a set of plugins, which enables the user to use a special syntax that
    can be transformed to HTML, JSX, or CSS. It is a productivity boost that allows
    the user to quickly write the code. In WebStorm, the configurations are made in
    the settings pages found under the **Settings** | **Editor** | **Emmet** page.
    There are separate configuration pages for **General, HMTL**, **JSX**, and **CSS**
    settings, as seen in the following screenshot:'

    open the `index.html` and `main.css` files.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While you type your Emmet code, WebStorm will show a preview window if you have
    selected this in the HTML settings page. It is a good idea to do that in the beginning
    while you get accustomed to the syntax. The preview will show what your final
    code will look like.

    position your caret there, and type `ul#features>li.feature*4`. Then press the
    *Tab* key. This will expand the code as follows:'

    *Tab*, this will be expanded to font-size, where we can set the required font
    size. For the CSS, the preview is always activated.

    However, if you want to study this subject further, I suggest going through the
    documentation available at [http://docs.emmet.io/](http://docs.emmet.io/).

- en: The TODO facility
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: WebStorm includes the TODO facility so that you can create a list of tasks for
    other users or for a future reface. It can be also be used as a notification system
    that informs the users about issues that require attention such as questions to
    answer, things to do at a later stage, optimizations, and improvements. It is
    an indispensable tool when working on large projects where multiple users collaborate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To use `TODO`, you have to enter special comments in the source code. By default,
    WebStorm comes with two pre-defined patterns, but you can define as many patterns
    as you need. The default pattern requires you to create a comment with the `TODO`
    of the `FIXME` keyword. These special comments are highlighted with special colors
    that can be defined in the **Preferences** | **Editor** | **Colors and Fonts**
    | **General** settings page.

    place. You can also create filters and custom rules so that you see only the relevant
    items.

- en: The difference viewer
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: WebStorm has a special mode that allows us to compare two files or a file at
    different moments in time (for example, different Git commits). In this mode,
    we can easily spot the differences between two files or the changes that were
    made to a file. The differences viewer is also an editor that has code completion,
    live templates, and so on. Therefore, we can change the code directly in this
    mode.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The dialog can be accessed by either the **View** | **Compare With** menu or
    by selecting two files in the **Project** panel. To compare the file with a version
    from a commit, you need to go to the **Version Control** log, select a file, and
    then select **Show Diff** from the context menu.

- en: Tracking Local History
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every file that is modified in WebStorm has the benefit of a powerful local
    history mode that tracks all the changes made to that file. Local history acts
    like a local version control system that works in parallel with the other systems
    that might be attached to the project, and tracks all the changes, even the ones
    made between commits to the other VCS.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Local History tracks only the changes made to textual files that are smaller
    than 1 MB. To access the dialog, you need to select **Local History** from the
    context menu of any opened file.

    Emmet, track the tasks that need to be performed in the project, and to view the
    differences between two files or the changes made to a file over a period of time.

    can help you in your daily tasks. I can say from experience that all the time
    spent learning this IDE will make you a more confident and productive developer.
    It is an invaluable tool for development, helping you through your journey from
    developing simple web pages to more and more complex applications, debugging,
    and testing of your code.
