<h1 class="chapterTitle" id="_idParaDest-323">Exporting, Printing, and Uploading Your Manga</h1>
<p class="normal">Now that we have our comics or illustrations sketched, inked, and colored, it’s time to get them out of Clip Studio Paint and to the print shop or onto our social media or website. This last chapter will teach you about the exporting option in the software, including how to resize pages and adjust the resolution during exporting.</p>
<p class="normal">We will start this chapter by learning how to make your manga file ready for homemade printing by adjusting the print settings and moving on to render a file in a printer-shop-friendly format, learning about the uniqueness of each file format. We will look closely at how to adjust image quality and file size, and how to resize the final image. Finally, we will learn how to export manga files for web uploads with an additional two useful EX version-only functions.</p>
<p class="normal">The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Printing at home</li>
<li class="bulletList">Exporting for print</li>
<li class="bulletList">Adjusting image quality and file size</li>
<li class="bulletList">Resizing an image while exporting</li>
<li class="bulletList">Exporting for a web display</li>
<li class="bulletList">Exporting webtoons (EX only)</li>
<li class="bulletList">Exporting batches of pages (EX only)</li>
<li class="bulletList">Exporting to Clip Studio SHARE</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">By the end of this chapter, you will be able to understand how to handle your manga in terms of publishing both on the internet and in physically bound manga books. This will give you a great idea of what your manga will finally look like so that when you create a new manga, you can have the best choice in terms of canvas size and resolution!</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s get ready to share our work with the world!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-324">Technical requirements</h1>
<p class="normal">To get started, you need Clip Studio Paint already installed on your device, and in order to create at least three pages of manga, I recommend creating an A5 portrait canvas with 300 dpi per page to go through the content in this chapter.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-325">Printing at home</h1>
<p class="normal">It takes a great amount<a id="_idIndexMarker1411"/> of work in terms of getting ready to print, and then doing the actual printing and binding everything together by yourself, but the artwork will give you a wonderful crafty feeling! In this section, we are going to learn how to make your manga creation ready for home printing.</p>
<p class="normal">Over the past few years, home printers have become more affordable and more powerful. Just a decade ago, most home printers were only able to produce decent prints from digital photographs. Now, we have home printers that can print beautiful, high-quality images without breaking the bank. Some printers are even “artist-grade” now and can print in wide formats, on fabric, and more.</p>
<p class="normal">There are so many home printers now that we obviously can’t give a rundown of all of them in this book. It is best to do your own research before buying a printer and think about how you will use the printer. If you are mainly doing black and white prints, you can probably get away with a slightly less expensive printer or even a laser printer that uses toner instead of ink cartridges. If you are going to print lots of large prints, you may want to consider getting a wide-format printer. Printers can be set up with continuous ink systems to save on color ink costs for those who print lots of high-quality photographs or paintings. Read reviews online and compare the features of different printers before purchasing one. I recommend Canon or Epson printers for their fantastic art printing results! My favorite is the Canon PIXMA series for its quality and color expression.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">If you do a lot of printing at home, make sure that you keep ink cartridges handy. Ink always runs out at the most inconvenient times! And it’s always safer to buy genuine cartridges, instead of compatible cheaper ones, because this extends your printer’s life.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">You will also <a id="_idIndexMarker1412"/>want some high-quality paper. I like photo paper, cardstock, or presentation paper for my art prints, but thinner paper will work as well. Make sure that you don’t go too thin, however, because if we saturate a thin piece of paper with lots of ink, it will become wrinkled and warped, and the back of the page will be see-through!</p>
<p class="normal">Most inkjet printers will print fine from a file that is set up in RGB color mode, so when we have finished creating our manga, we don’t need to convert our Clip Studio file at all to print from it. Ensure that your printer drivers are up to date, as this will solve most printer problems.</p>
<p class="normal">Follow these steps to print an image from Clip Studio Paint:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Open the file that you wish to print in Clip Studio Paint. Whether it’s a color or a black-and-white file is up to you.</li>
<li class="numberedList">In the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu, click on <strong class="screenText">File </strong>|<strong class="screenText"> Print settings</strong> to review the <strong class="screenText">Print Settings</strong> dialog box. The <strong class="screenText">Print Settings</strong> dialog box is shown here:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_19_19.1.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 19.1 – Print Settings dialog box</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="3">Under <strong class="screenText">Preview</strong>, check <a id="_idIndexMarker1413"/>the box next to <strong class="screenText">Preview rendering result on output</strong>. This option allows us to see what our page will look like before the print begins and will allow us to stop the printing process if something is wrong.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Choose the correct <strong class="screenText">Print size</strong> settings from the drop-down menu.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">We will now examine the remainder of the options in the <strong class="screenText">Print Settings</strong> dialog box:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Print Settings</strong>: Most print jobs should be able to use the <strong class="screenText">Actual size</strong> or <strong class="screenText">Scale according to paper size</strong> options. The <strong class="screenText">Actual size</strong> setting prints according to the size the file is set up as. The <strong class="screenText">Scale according to paper size</strong> option will resize the print contents to the size of the paper in the printer, as the following printing examples demonstrate:</li>
</ul>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_19_19.2.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 19.2 – Screenshot of the Actual size and Scale according to paper size option results</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Other<strong class="screenText"> Print Settings</strong> options<a id="_idIndexMarker1414"/> are <strong class="screenText">Pixel size</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Dual page (EX only)</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Spread (EX only)</strong>. With <strong class="screenText">Pixel size</strong>, the size for printing is adjusted so that the relationship between the image pixel and screen pixel is 1 to 1. With <strong class="screenText">Dual page (EX only)</strong>, the page layout for printing is set to dual page. Two pages are printed on one sheet of paper. The margin on the front side becomes the outer side, as the binding margin will be on the outer side of the paper. Finally, with <strong class="screenText">Spread (EX only)</strong>, the page layout for printing is set to a two-page spread. Two pages are printed on one sheet of paper. The margin will be on the outer side of the paper.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Output image</strong>: This option gives us the chance to print or not print some parts of our image. Usually, any layers set as a <strong class="screenText">Draft</strong> layer will not print or export, but we can choose to print draft layers by checking the box next to <strong class="screenText">Draft</strong>. We can also choose to print or not print text, story information, and more. Under <strong class="screenText">Export range (EX only)</strong> are the <strong class="screenText">All pages</strong>, <strong class="screenText">To offset of crop mark</strong>, or <strong class="screenText">To inside of crop mark</strong> options. If we have artwork that extends outside of any crop marks (the bleed area of the art), but we want it to be printed, we should select the <strong class="screenText">All pages</strong> option. The other two options will stop the printing at the crop marks or inside of the crop marks. The results of the various options are indicated in the following screenshot:</li>
</ul>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_19_19.3.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 19.3 – Screenshot of the Output image option results</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Color</strong>: Under <a id="_idIndexMarker1415"/>the <strong class="screenText">Expression color</strong> settings, we have another drop-down menu with several options. The first one is <strong class="screenText">Auto detect appropriate color depth</strong>, which allows Clip Studio Paint to automatically set the color depth depending on the file being printed. </li>
</ul>
<p class="bulletList">There are two <strong class="screenText">Duotone</strong> options, one called <strong class="screenText">Threshold</strong> and one called <strong class="screenText">Toning</strong>. Both options print in pure black and white, with no gray tones. The <strong class="screenText">Threshold</strong> option takes any gray or color tones and automatically converts them into black or white. The <strong class="screenText">Toning</strong> option still prints in pure black and white with no gray, but it converts any gray or color areas into areas of black dots that mimic shading. The <strong class="screenText">Gray</strong> option prints in grayscale and the <strong class="screenText">RGB color</strong> setting prints the image with the RGB values that the printer translates into its own ink colors:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_19_19.4.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 19.4 – Screenshot of the Expression color option results</p>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 19.5 – Screenshot of the Expression color options</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">The <strong class="screenText">Advanced settings of color</strong> options do not actually provide us with advanced <a id="_idIndexMarker1417"/>color options, but instead options for printing out the crop marks and tones. Here is a screenshot of the <strong class="screenText">Advanced settings of color</strong> dialog box:</li>
</ul>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 19.6 – Screenshot of the Advanced settings of color dialog box</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">In the <strong class="screenText">Crop marks/Default border/Safety margins</strong> option, we can set it to <strong class="screenText">Export in displayed colors</strong> (prints in the color that the borders are set to in the preferences). We can also set it to <strong class="screenText">Export in black</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Export in cyan</strong>, which are both pretty self-explanatory!<div><p class="normal">Under the <strong class="screenText">Export settings for tone</strong> settings, we can resize screentones depending on the scale of the print (<strong class="screenText">Depend on export scale</strong>) or use the settings of the tones in the image itself (<strong class="screenText">Follow layer settings</strong>). Depending on the scale of the printed image, this can be used to control any moiré patterns that may occur from the screentones. Moiré is a pattern that appears unintentionally on the area where line patterns are overlapped, which sometimes occurs on prints where you used screentones:</p>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_19_19.7.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 19.7 – Screenshot of an example of a moiré pattern</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">We can<a id="_idIndexMarker1418"/> ignore <strong class="screenText">Export settings for camera path</strong> unless you recorded the camera path with keyframes in animation.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Process when scaling</strong>: We can now go back to <strong class="screenText">Print Settings</strong> to finish adjusting our options. The final print settings section, which is demonstrated in the following screenshot, is the <strong class="screenText">Process when scaling</strong> options. These are <strong class="screenText">For illustration</strong> and <strong class="screenText">For comic</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="bulletList">These settings change how the image is processed before it is printed. If we don’t use lots of tones, then the <strong class="screenText">For illustration</strong> setting is suitable for our needs. In the <strong class="screenText">For comic</strong> setting, the tone layers are processed individually before printing so that they are scaled, meaning there’s less of a chance of getting a moiré pattern:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_19_19.8.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 19.8 – Screenshot of the Process when scaling settings</p>
<p class="normal">Finally, we have a <a id="_idIndexMarker1419"/>drop-down menu for our <strong class="screenText">Rasterize</strong> settings. The <strong class="screenText">Fast</strong> setting is fine if we are printing out a quick copy just to see how our text or layout looks. For a better print, use the <strong class="screenText">Prefer quality</strong> setting. Well, that’s all the explanations for print settings. Now, follow the steps to save the settings you have just adjusted:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Click on the <strong class="screenText">OK</strong> button.</li>
<li class="numberedList">To print now, click on the <strong class="screenText">Print</strong> button. You will be asked to select your printer and any printer settings before seeing the print preview screen. If anything doesn’t look right in the preview screen, cancel the print job, adjust the print settings, and then try again.</li>
<li class="numberedList">If you did not execute the print from the <strong class="screenText">Print Settings</strong> window, you can click on <strong class="screenText">File</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Print</strong> to print the image when you are ready.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">Even by only focusing on the printing options that Clip Studio Paint has, it’s a lot to take in! Be sure to look at any printer-specific options that you may have to adjust, such as the print quality and the number of copies. You may have to adjust things a few times to get the best print from your home printer.</p>
<p class="normal">With most home printers, it’s not economical to print out multiple copies of our comic to hand out or to sell. It may be perfect for small runs of color prints, but for any larger<a id="_idIndexMarker1420"/> number of prints, we will want to export our images so that we can send them to a publisher or print shop. Let’s find out how in the next section.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-326">Exporting for print</h1>
<p class="normal">Whether you’re<a id="_idIndexMarker1421"/> making comic books or making pin-up images to sell at a convention, you’ll need to know how to print from Clip Studio Paint or how to export the images you create to send to your local print shop, an online printer, or publisher. If you don’t know already, you can get your art printed on stickers, badges, mugs, T-shirts, patches, and more!</p>
<p class="normal">In this section, we are looking into how to prepare your manga file to be ready to send to a print shop or publisher.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Even if you are only planning on displaying your work on the internet, you should still think about setting up your file as though you are going to print it. Work in 300 dpi and set up your file dimensions to match whatever paper size you will end up printing on. Even if you are only thinking about the internet now, you may eventually want to start printing your art. Setting it up for print when you create it will save a lot of time, headaches, and redrawing later!</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">There is a big difference between sending our files to a professional offset printer or to a book publisher that handles small quantities of books on demand or sending them to the copy shop down the street. When sending your files out for printing, make sure that you research what file formats the printer accepts and whether or not they have any restrictions. When taking your files to a local chain office supply store or a copy shop, most file formats will do fine, so it’s up to you how you want to format your images.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">If and when possible, find a small, local print shop where you can do large amounts of printing. Not only do they usually have better prices, but they can often work with you on special projects. Also, the staff at these small stores tend to have more knowledge of their equipment and how to get the best quality prints for your art.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">In this section, we are going to export high-quality, lossless versions of our images that will look good when printed and can be opened by anyone even if they don’t have Clip<a id="_idIndexMarker1422"/> Studio Paint. Follow these steps to export your images in a format suitable for print:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Open the image you wish to export.</li>
<li class="numberedList">In the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu, click on <strong class="screenText">File</strong> and then go down to the <strong class="screenText">Export (Single Layer)</strong> option.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="3">From the list of options under the <strong class="screenText">Export (Single Layer)</strong> option, choose the file format in which to export the image and then click on it. File formats will be discussed after these steps.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Name your file and choose the location to save to in the window that appears.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click <strong class="screenText">Save</strong> to bring up an export settings dialog window.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Choose the parameters to be exported in the window. It should look similar to the <strong class="screenText">psd export settings</strong> window shown in the following screenshot. Some of these options should look familiar from <strong class="screenText">Print Settings</strong> in the previous section:</li>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 19.10 – Screenshot of the Export (Single Layer) options</p>
<p class="normal">The following list <a id="_idIndexMarker1423"/>explains each of the file formats:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">.bmp</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">BMP</strong>): Bitmap<a id="_idIndexMarker1424"/> image. Lossless format with no compression. Creates large file sizes.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">.jpg </strong>(<strong class="keyWord">JPEG</strong>): Widely used compressed image format. Suitable for web displays, but sometimes not suitable when printing images.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">.png </strong>(<strong class="keyWord">Portable Network Graphics (PNG)</strong>): Lossless image format capable of preserving transparency in the final output and suitable for color or grayscale. Image file sizes are small but maintain the original quality.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">.tif</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">TIFF</strong>): Lossless file format that can preserve layer information, transparency, and original quality. Not suitable for online displays, but good for storage or editing.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">.tga</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">Truevision Advanced Raster Graphics Adapter (TARGA)</strong>): Bitmap image format not suitable for photographs or images with lots of gradients, but suitable for simple images such as icons, cartoons, and line art.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">.webp (WebP)</strong>: Google-made file format allows websites to display high-quality images in much smaller sizes than other formats such as PNG and JPEG. Suitable for web displays.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">.psb</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">Photoshop Big Document</strong>): Adobe Photoshop image format suitable for handling large images with lots of color depth, resolution, or large canvas size. Not suitable for web displays.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">.psd</strong> (<strong class="keyWord">Photoshop Document</strong>): Adobe Photoshop document format suitable for<a id="_idIndexMarker1425"/> images that will be opened and edited further in Photoshop. Not suitable for web displays.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">You don’t have to memorize all the information pertaining to each file format, but just remember the most suitable one for you, so next time you’re exporting a manga file, you know exactly which one to choose. Generally, it’s good to know that JPEG is for web display and PNG and PSD are for printing.</p>
<p class="normal">You now know about <a id="_idIndexMarker1426"/>size formats, but what about controlling the image quality and file size? Does this mean that JPEG is a compressed image format and not suitable for printing? We will find that out in the next section.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-327">Adjusting image quality and file size</h1>
<p class="normal">There are times<a id="_idIndexMarker1427"/> when you do not need to save a full-resolution image, such as when exporting for the internet or sending proof to a client. This section will explain how to export an image with compression so that the image quality and file size are decreased for easy handling. You will need an open file to export before starting the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">In the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu, go to <strong class="screenText">File</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Export (Single Layer)</strong> | <strong class="screenText">.jpg (JPEG)</strong>.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Name the file and choose the folder to save it in. Click on <strong class="screenText">Save</strong>.</li>
<li class="numberedList">The <strong class="screenText">JPEG export settings</strong> dialog box will appear. Click on the checkbox next to <strong class="screenText">Preview rendering result on output</strong> at the top of the window to enable this option.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Under <strong class="screenText">JPEG settings</strong>, find the <strong class="screenText">Quality</strong> setting. It is marked in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_19_19.11.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 19.11 – Screenshot of JPEG export settings</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="5">Adjust the <a id="_idIndexMarker1428"/>setting using the slider or arrows to change the compression of the file. The smaller the number, the more compressed the file will be. Compression sacrifices image quality to make the final file size smaller.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on <strong class="screenText">OK</strong>.</li>
<li class="numberedList">The <strong class="screenText">Export preview</strong> window will now appear. If needed, continue to adjust the quality using the setting in the bottom-right corner of the preview window.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on <strong class="screenText">OK</strong> to complete the export.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">The quality setting controls the amount of compression in the final file. Compression lowers image quality to make the overall file size smaller, making images load faster on the internet. </p>
<p class="normal">In the following screenshot, the <strong class="screenText">Quality</strong> option is set to <strong class="screenText">90</strong>. Note the large file size at the bottom right of the window, at 601.97 KB:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_19_19.12.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 19.12 – Screenshot of Export preview with 90% quality</p>
<p class="normal">We can make<a id="_idIndexMarker1429"/><a id="_idIndexMarker1430"/> the final file size smaller by lowering the quality. By doing this, the quality of the image is reduced. Note how much the file size has gone down in the following screenshot, but also note how pixelated the image has become because of the low quality, especially around the gradients and the black lines:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_19_19.13.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 19.13 – Screenshot of Export preview with 20% quality</p>
<p class="normal">We reduced the image quality, so the file size is much lighter and easy to handle! This is perfect for an image that can be used as a thumbnail on the internet. Obviously, we cannot use it for printing because of the low quality and pixelated noise in the image. I would recommend using <strong class="screenText">.jpg</strong> image files only for internet use.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Important note</strong></p>
<p class="normal">The image quality can only be adjusted when exporting to <code class="inlineCode">.jpg</code> and <code class="inlineCode">.webp</code> file formats. Other formats are lossless and cannot be compressed.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Now, you know how to adjust the quality of the image, and what will happen if you reduce the image quality to a lower resolution. However, <code class="inlineCode">.jpg</code> and <code class="inlineCode">.webp</code> are the only formats for adjusting quality; the other file formats can be resized while maintaining file <a id="_idIndexMarker1431"/>quality. We can export files to match the size in terms of percentage, width, or resolution, which is covered in the next section.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-328">Resizing an image while exporting</h1>
<p class="normal">Another way of <a id="_idIndexMarker1432"/>changing the file size of the exported image is by changing the width and height of the image during the process. This can be done on the fly without making any changes to your original file, ensuring that you’ll never accidentally save a 600-pixel-wide version of your original drawing ever again.</p>
<p class="normal">You will need an open file to export in order to complete the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">In the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu, go to <strong class="screenText">Export (Single Layer)</strong> and choose the desired file format for the new file. For this example, we will be using the <strong class="screenText">.png</strong> file format.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Name the file and choose a folder on your computer to save it. Click on <strong class="screenText">Save</strong>. The export settings for the file format you chose in <em class="italic">Step 1</em> will appear.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Locate the <strong class="screenText">Output size</strong> options. They are marked in this screenshot:</li>

<p class="normal">Great! Now we know how to change the export image quality and size. Let’s see what we need to do specifically when we upload images to the internet in the next section.</p>

<p class="normal">In addition to<a id="_idIndexMarker1435"/> getting your work printed, one of the best ways to get known as an artist is to post your work on the internet. Whether you have your own website, an account on a host, or are posting to social media, the web is a great way to connect with other artists and share your art and stories with the entire world.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s export a comic page with internet-friendly settings. You will need an image open to export. It can be of any width, height, and resolution. We will be adjusting these parameters as we complete the export process.</p>
<p class="normal">Follow these steps to complete this process:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Execute the <strong class="screenText">Export (Single Layer)</strong> command as detailed in the previous sections of this chapter and choose a format that is friendly for web display. <strong class="screenText">JPEG</strong> is recommended because of its small file sizes and ability to control the compression, and most social media platforms accept it.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Name your file and choose a folder to save it in on your computer. Click on <strong class="screenText">Save</strong>.</li>
<li class="numberedList">In the <strong class="screenText">export settings</strong> window that then appears, ensure that the <strong class="screenText">Preview rendering result on output</strong> option is checked.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="4">If you are using the <code class="inlineCode">.jpg</code> format, adjust the <strong class="screenText">Quality</strong> option as explained in the previous section. In this screenshot, we have set the <strong class="screenText">Quality</strong> option to <strong class="screenText">70</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_19_19.17.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 19.17 – Screenshot of the JPEG Quality option</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="5">Adjust the <strong class="screenText">Output size</strong> options to dimensions that are web friendly. Usually, this is <strong class="screenText">1000</strong> pixels or less in width, but this might change depending on the format of your image or the website that the image will be uploaded to. For example, a horizontal comic strip may need to be wider than this to be legible. In the following screenshot, we have used<a id="_idIndexMarker1436"/> the <strong class="screenText">Specify output size</strong> option to set the image width to <strong class="screenText">1000</strong> pixels:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_19_19.161.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 19.18 – Screenshot of the JPEG Output size options</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="6">At the bottom of the export settings dialog box, we have the <strong class="screenText">Process when scaling</strong> options. If you are exporting a colored image or an image that doesn’t use screentones, select the <strong class="screenText">For illustration</strong> option. If the export image is a comic with screentones, choose the <strong class="screenText">For comic</strong> option instead to cut down on the number of moiré patterns in the exported image.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on <strong class="screenText">OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Export preview</strong> window will be displayed once the image has been rendered. Use this preview to review the dimensions and the quality of the final exported file. Make any changes to the file quality by using the option in the bottom-right corner of the preview window. This allows us to change the compression before the final export so that we can ensure that we have a good-looking image with a reasonable file size.</p>
<p class="normal">In the following screenshot, we adjusted the quality<a id="_idIndexMarker1437"/> from the initial <strong class="screenText">70</strong> to <strong class="screenText">80</strong> to achieve better image quality while keeping the file size small:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_19_19.19.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 19.19 – Screenshot of the Export preview window</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="8">Click on <strong class="screenText">OK</strong> to complete the export.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">Done! You are now ready to upload your creation to the internet!</p>
<p class="normal">For people who already have or are thinking of switching to the EX version of Clip Studio Paint, which is more expensive and has more functions for expert use than the Pro version, I’d like to tell you that there is a very useful function for creating webtoons. Webtoons are becoming a bigger phenomenon nowadays in scroll-reading <a id="_idIndexMarker1438"/>style manga and comic websites. Read on to find out how to export a file as a webtoon.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-330">Exporting webtoons (EX only)</h1>
<p class="normal">A webtoon is a<a id="_idIndexMarker1439"/> spindle belt-shaped manga <a id="_idIndexMarker1440"/>or comic, just like a film reel, for readers to scroll through to read the manga or comic. You can create a very long webtoon, which readers can scroll through and read to enjoy without clicking to see the next page. It works wonderfully for a platform such as X, where only a limited number of images can be attached to one post.</p>
<p class="normal">The following screenshot shows a style difference between an analog story manga and a webtoon:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_19_19.20.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 19.20 – Screenshot of the style difference</p>
<p class="normal">However, if it’s getting too long, it also becomes difficult to handle. You can’t check the contents in thumbnails, and it is not easy to jump to a specific spot to edit. The best way is to create a B5-size manga page and then put a few pages together to make a belt shape.</p>
<p class="normal">In this section, we will learn how to export files as webtoons easily with the help of Clip Studio Paint EX.</p>
<p class="normal">You can<a id="_idIndexMarker1441"/> do<a id="_idIndexMarker1442"/> this by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Create a manga that contains more than two pages.</li>
<li class="numberedList">In the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu, select <strong class="screenText">Special Export</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Export webtoon…</strong> to bring up an <strong class="screenText">Export webtoon</strong> dialog box, which looks like the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_19_19.21.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 19.21 – Screenshot of the Export webtoon dialog box</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="3">There are<a id="_idIndexMarker1443"/> selections for exporting<a id="_idIndexMarker1444"/> file formats, which are <strong class="screenText">.png (PNG) or .jpg (JPEG)</strong>, from the <strong class="screenText">File format</strong> drop-down menu. Select <strong class="screenText">.jpg (JPEG)</strong> for a safe option because it’s widely used on most websites and social media platforms. Also, change the name of the exporting file to something of your choosing.</li>
<li class="numberedList">In the <strong class="screenText">Output size</strong> settings, you can scale up or down by changing the number for the percentage. You can also choose <strong class="screenText">Specify width</strong> by typing the desired width in pixels. This is very useful for some social media platforms or websites where they limit the width of the image to upload.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="5">In the <strong class="screenText">Page range</strong> settings, you can choose what page to export. Selecting <strong class="screenText">All pages</strong> exports all pages, and by selecting <strong class="screenText">Specify pages</strong>, you can type the start and end page numbers.</li>
<li class="numberedList">In the <strong class="screenText">File export</strong> settings, selecting <strong class="screenText">Export pages separately</strong> exports pages as individual images. Selecting <strong class="screenText">Export as one continuous page</strong> exports one image in which all the selected pages are connected vertically like a film reel. By selecting <strong class="screenText">Divide vertically</strong>, you can also divide pages into two vertically at the point or length of the pixel you typed. At the bottom of the dialog box, you can see the number of files and the total height in pixels.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Once you <a id="_idIndexMarker1445"/>have finalized <a id="_idIndexMarker1446"/>all the settings, click <strong class="screenText">OK</strong> to export. Please be patient; it may take a few minutes to complete.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">In the following screenshot, there are samples of how files look when exported with the <strong class="screenText">Export as one continuous page</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Divide vertically</strong> options:</p>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 19.22 – Screenshot of the two exported files</p>
<p class="normal">You have now mastered how to create a webtoon for sharing on your social media or website!</p>
<p class="normal">Now, we are going to look at another great function that Clip Studio EX possesses, which<a id="_idIndexMarker1447"/> is exporting pages as a <a id="_idIndexMarker1448"/>batch, meaning you don’t need to resize or change the image quality one by one! What a time saver! Read on to find out how to do this.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-331">Exporting batches of pages (EX only)</h1>
<p class="normal">In this section, we are going to learn how to export manga pages as a batch.</p>
<p class="normal">There is no need<a id="_idIndexMarker1449"/> to export your entire manga one page at a time so long as you have Clip Studio Paint EX. Because we can create story files in the EX version of the software, we can also export all or part of those story files all at once. They can even all be resized and compressed at the same time too, thereby saving you lots of time and effort in finishing up a project.</p>
<p class="normal">Follow these steps to export an entire chapter’s worth of pages at once:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">In the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu, go to <strong class="screenText">Export multiple pages</strong> and then click on <strong class="screenText">Batch export…</strong>. This menu is shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 19.23 – Screenshot of the Export multiple pages option</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="2">The <strong class="screenText">Batch export</strong> dialog<a id="_idIndexMarker1450"/> box will appear, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 19.24 – Screenshot of the Batch export dialog box</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="3">Use the drop-down menu to choose the file format for the exported images.</li>
<li class="numberedList">If desired, click<a id="_idIndexMarker1451"/> on the box next to <strong class="screenText">Write text to file</strong> to make a file of the text used in the story file.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="5">In the <strong class="screenText">Name</strong> box, type a name, which will be the beginning of the filename for each exported image.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Select <strong class="screenText">Page range</strong>. The <strong class="screenText">All</strong> option will export all images in the story file. The <strong class="screenText">Only cover page</strong> option will allow us to export just the front cover, just the back cover, or all cover pages. The <strong class="screenText">Only body pages</strong> option allows us to select a range of interior pages to export.</li>
<li class="numberedList">To export each page of a two-page spread as a separate image, check the box next to <strong class="screenText">Split spread pages</strong>.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on <strong class="screenText">OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal-one">Clip Studio Paint will now load the file and prepare it for export. This may take several minutes, depending on your computer’s specifications and the size of your file. Be patient!</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="9">Once the file has loaded, the export settings for the chosen file format will be shown. Adjust them as detailed in the other sections of this chapter.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on <strong class="screenText">OK</strong> when all the settings have been adjusted to complete the export.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">I am certain that this will save you so much time if you are creating a long story manga. But did you know that there is a manga-sharing function in Clip Studio Start screen? It’s <a id="_idIndexMarker1452"/>one of the great places to share your creations, which will create a 3D viewer virtual manga book for you. Then, you can use the link to the page to put on your social media! Let’s find this out in the next section.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-332">Exporting to Clip Studio SHARE</h1>
<p class="normal">In this section, we’re<a id="_idIndexMarker1453"/> exploring the Clip Studio<a id="_idIndexMarker1454"/> SHARE function in Clip Studio Start, where you can create a showcase of your work.</p>
<p class="normal">When you are uploading manga that is more than four pages long, it’s tough to show everything in order in divided posts on X, Instagram, Facebook, Tumblr, or other social media platforms.</p>
<p class="normal">Using Clip Studio SHARE helps to upload a manga that is more than 4 pages in length in the correct order by creating a special link for easy browsing, which you can paste on your social media! Clip Studio SHARE even creates a virtual 3D manga book for you with a cover and a spine of your design.</p>
<p class="normal">Fir1st. of all, you need to have a manga that contains more than three pages and then follow these steps to create your manga on display using Clip Studio SHARE:</p>

<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-333">Summary</h1>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we have learned how to take our art from Clip Studio Paint and change it into files that we can share with the world. First, we learned how to print our images from Clip Studio to our home printer. Then, we learned how to export our images to be sent to a print shop, copy shop, or publisher. We learned how to adjust the image quality and the dimensions, and how to export our images so that they display well on the internet. Then, we learned what a webtoon is and how to export this in the EX version, and we also learned about another great EX privilege – exporting batches of pages. Finally, we learned about a great Clip Studio Start service, Clip Studio SHARE, where you can create a virtual showcase of your manga.</p>
<p class="normal">This is the last chapter of this book. It has been a long and fun journey learning how to use Clip Studio Paint for our creations, and now it has come to an end. I hope all these skills and tips will be helpful and inspiring to your creative life.</p>
