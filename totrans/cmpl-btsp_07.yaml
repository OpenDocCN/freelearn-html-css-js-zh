    to use them. In this chapter, we're going to change gears and learn about Sass,
    which will allow you to customize the look and feel of your components. I'll start
    by introducing some Sass basics that you need to know, move on to writing some
    basic code, and then show you the power of using variables in your components
    to save yourself valuable time when creating your web app or project.

- en: Sass stands for **Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets**. If you've never used
    or heard of Sass before, it's a CSS preprocessor. A preprocessor extends regular
    CSS by allowing the use of things such as variables, operators, and mixins in
    CSS. Sass is written during the development stage of your project and it needs
    to be compiled into regular CSS before you deploy your project into production.
    I'll cover that in more detail in the next section but don't worry because Harp.js
    makes this really easy to do.
  prefs: []

- en: Up until version 4 of Bootstrap, the CSS preprocessor used was actually Less.
    For a good while both Sass and Less were popular in frontend design circles. However,
    over the last few years, while Sass has emerged as the best choice for developers,
    the Bootstrap team decided to make the change in version 4\. If you are familiar
    with Less but have never used Sass, don't worry as they are pretty similar to
    use so it won't take much to get you up-to-speed.

    and the browser cannot read it in its native format. Before you can deploy the
    project, you need to convert or compile the Sass files into regular CSS files.
    Normally this would require you to install a Ruby gem and you would have to manually
    compile your code before you can test it. Luckily for us, Harp.js actually has
    an Sass compiler built into it. So when you run the `harp compile` command to
    build your templates, it will also build your Sass files into regular CSS. I bet
    you're starting to like Harp even more after learning that.

    create a library of global variables that can be used throughout your theme. Think
    of things such as colors, backgrounds, typography, links, borders, margins, and
    padding. It's best to only define these common properties once and then you can
    reuse them through different components. Before we go too far, we need to create
    a new `.scss` file. Open up your text editor, create a new file, and call it `_variables.scss`.
    Save that file to the `/css/components` directory. For now, you can just leave

    if you ever want to make all your components a little bigger or smaller, you can
    just tweak this one pixel value.
  prefs:

    a good starting place to get an idea of what is involved in this process. It also
    builds on the code we wrote for the button so it's a natural second step. It's
    important to note that some components will require a good amount of CSS to customize
    them, while others will only need a little bit. Let's start by creating a new
    Sass file for drop-downs. From your project folder, create a new file called `_dropdown.scss`
