- en: In this chapter, we will first take a closer look at what kind of website we
    will create. Then, there’s a quick introduction to Bootstrap Icons, which is being
    used heavily throughout the website to make it more user-friendly and visually
    appealing. After that follows a description of the page setup, then a description
    with screenshots of a few global modules that are used across the website, and
    finally, a description with screenshots of each of the page types being used.

- en: The website is an online store with shopping-related pages for a product overview,
    product details, wishlist, shopping cart, and checkout flow, as well as more content-related
    pages for various information. It has a total of 12 pages with eight of them being
    unique in structure and layout, and the remaining four using the same structure
    and layout.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The website has been designed and developed using only default Bootstrap 5 elements
    and the content consists of placeholder text and images. Because of this, the
    website has a wireframe-like appearance. However, if you substitute all text and
    images, the website will look more real.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you probably are aware, Bootstrap 5 only contains code for the frontend of
    a website. Because of this, all the advanced features of the website that require
    communication with a backend have not been implemented. This includes the search
    functionality, filters, sorting, form submission, and more. In [*Chapter 9*](B17143_09_epub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor199),
    *Improving the Website with Interactive Features Using JavaScript*, we will extend
    the basic functionality with some custom JavaScript to make the website more interactive
    and user-friendly.
