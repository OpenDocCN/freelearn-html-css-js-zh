- en: Web designing is not everyone's cup of tea. I have seen many experienced web
    developers who are extremely poor at web designing. They have the ability to make
    the most powerful applications, but lack the skills to create a decent looking
    website.

- en: On the other hand, there's a sudden rise in the popularity of CSS and JavaScript
    frontend frameworks. These frameworks let the users create popular CSS and JavaScript
    components, such as drop-down menus, responsive menus, a proper grid system to
    structure websites, and so on easily without having any knowledge about CSS and
    JavaScript coding. Bootstrap, being one of the pioneers in the book, provides
    many prestyled CSS components that come ready to be used. You simply need to know
    the appropriate HTML files to use these frontend frameworks.
