                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Script includes are at the heart of scripting in ServiceNow, and are arguably the most commonly used when it comes to writing code. Script includes are used to hold classes of code, and for a lot of the backend script used by the ServiceNow platform.</p>
<p>When creating your script include, you first need to give it a name. This name will be important, as it will be used in other code to call the methods in your script include.</p>
<div class="packt_tip"><span>Ensure that the name you choose for your script include does not contain spaces in it. It is best to use underscores to separate words in the name.</span></div>
<p>Once you enter a name for your script include, you will notice that the <span class="packt_screen">API Name</span> and the <span class="packt_screen">script</span> fields are populated. The API name is read-only, and given based upon the name of the application this script include is being created in, followed by the name of the script include itself.</p>
<p>The script field is populated with some introductory script creating a class for this script include, taking into account the name of the script include. As an example, if we named our script include <kbd>script_utils</kbd>, we would be given the following script:</p>
<pre>var script_utils = Class.create();<br/>script_utils.prototype = {<br/>    initialize: function() {<br/>    },<br/><br/>    type: 'script_utils'<br/>};</pre>
<p>This gives us the basic code to create a script include class that can be called from the server side. One of the first questions to ask when creating a script include is whether the script will be called from the server side only, or from the client side. This is because if we are going to be calling the script include from the client side (for example, for an AJAX call), we need to tick the <span class="packt_screen">Client callable</span> checkbox, and in doing this, you will also notice that the code changes, too.</p>
<p>For our example, this will change the code to the following:</p>
<pre>var script_utils = Class.create();<br/>script_utils.prototype = Object.extendsObject(AbstractAjaxProcessor, {<br/><br/>    type: 'script_utils'<br/>});</pre>
<p>This changed script allows the script include to inherit the <kbd>AbstractAjaxProcessor</kbd>. Without this, AJAX calls will not work, so it is important to remember this if the script include will be called on the client.</p>
<p>Although this is the starter code that ServiceNow provides for you, it is not necessary to create a class in a script include. You can also simply create a function to call in a script include when calling server-side script.</p>
<p>Let's look at a short example of how that can be done:</p>
<pre>function script_include_test() {<br/>  return 'Test Complete';<br/>}</pre>
<p>This is a simple function that will just return the string of text, but can be called simply as a standalone function, rather than creating a whole class.</p>
<p>Let's now have a look at creating a script include with a class and methods. We can add as many methods as we like to our script include:</p>
<pre>var script_utils = Class.create();<br/>script_utils.prototype = {<br/>  initialize: function() {<br/>  },<br/>  <br/>  testMethod: function testMethod() {<br/>    return 'Method completed successfully';<br/>  },<br/>  <br/>  type: 'script_utils'<br/>};</pre>
<p>Our <kbd>testMethod</kbd> method will return a string when called on the server side. To call it, we use the line of code as follows:</p>
<pre>new script_utils().testMethod();</pre>
<p>We can also assign this line of code to a variable or use it for a condition check if the method returns true or false.</p>
<p>Script includes can also call each other and methods contained within them. When building up the bulk processing of server-side script, it is usually best to consider script includes for the job. Looking at the existing script includes that come with the ServiceNow platform is a good way to enhance your knowledge of writing script includes.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Scheduled jobs</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Scheduled jobs are a way of generating a report or record and automatically running a script. Creating a report or record is a configuration and does not require scripting. What we are interested in for scheduled jobs is the ability to automatically run a script.</p>
<p>A scheduled job is a helpful way to run a script at a time of your choosing. This can be an overnight job or a script that can run frequently, say, every hour. In my experience, running script out of hours is one of the main benefits and uses of a scheduled job. Common uses are preparing data for users first thing in the morning, or to remove old data.</p>
<p>When creating a scheduled job, we set the frequency of the scheduled job by using the <span class="packt_screen">run</span> field. The different time options in this field give the developer different fields to fill in to schedule the script execution appropriately. If the <span class="packt_screen">On Demand</span> option is picked, the script will only run if the <span class="packt_screen">Execute Now</span> button is pressed.</p>
<p>In addition to the schedule, we can also add a condition to the scheduled job so that it will only run when the condition evaluates to true. If you check the <span class="packt_screen">Conditional</span> checkbox, then an additional <span class="packt_screen">Condition</span> field is displayed. For the script in this <span class="packt_screen">Condition</span> field, the final expression of the code needs to evaluate to true or false.</p>
<p>Let's have a look at an example of a condition script for a scheduled job:</p>
<pre>var dateTime = new GlideDateTime();<br/>dateTime.getDayOfWeek() != '7'</pre>
<p>In the example, we are checking if the current day is Sunday, and if so, we will not run the scheduled job script. The <kbd>getDayOfWeek</kbd> method gives us the day of the week, with one being Monday and seven being Sunday.</p>
<p>The second line of script above can give a syntax error saying that a semicolon is missing and an expression is seen when a function call or assignment was expected. Normally this would be valid, but for the condition field in a scheduled job we are expecting an expression and adding a semicolon here would cause the script to break.</p>
<p>Now let us look at the <span class="packt_screen">Run this script</span> field. This is the field where we put the code that we would like to run at the scheduled time we have defined.</p>
<p>For an example, let us log that our code has run and that it is not a Sunday:</p>
<pre>gs.log('Today is not Sunday');</pre>
<p>We can write any server-side script we like in this field to run at the specified time. We will look at a more advanced example later in the chapter.</p>
<p>We can see what our scheduled job will look like if we set it to run daily at 1:00 a.m. <span>in </span><em>Figure 6.1</em>:</p>

<p>A scheduled job is a great way to run script-performing server-side tasks <span>out of business hours</span>.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Background scripts</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Background scripts are server-side scripts that administrators can immediately run on the ServiceNow platform. A background script cannot be saved and does not exist as a record. However, they can be extremely useful for trialing scripts out and fixing one-off issues with an instance.</p>
<p>To start creating a background script, you simply need to select the <span class="packt_screen">Scripts - Background</span> module in the <span class="packt_screen">System Definition</span> application. This brings up a large box for the developer to write their code into. If you have administrator access and you cannot see the module, there is a system property that can be set that means an elevated privilege is required to access background scripts. If this is the case, this usually means you need the <span class="packt_screen">security_admin</span> role to access background scripts.</p>
<p>Because background scripts grant the ability to run any JavaScript on the platform, this module is often locked down more securely for security purposes.</p>
<p>There are a few choices and buttons that appear under the large script box for background scripts. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Run script</span> (button): Runs the script currently in the <span class="packt_screen">Run script</span> box on the server side</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">in scope</span> (drop down): Allows the background script to be run in a different scope outside of global, if required</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Execute in sandbox?</span> (checkbox): Executes the script with sandbox restrictions; for example, data cannot be inserted, updated, or deleted</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Cancel after 4 hours</span> (checkbox): Check to cancel the script if it is still running after four hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's look at an example of a background script:</p>
<pre>var inci = new GlideRecord('incident');<br/>inci.addQuery('category', 'software');<br/>inci.query();<br/><br/>while (inci.next()) {<br/>  gs.log('Incident ' + inci.number + ' would be deleted');<br/>  //inci.deleteRecord();<br/>}</pre>
<p>In the example, we are checking for all of the incidents that have the software category. In the background script, we are logging each incident we find so that we can review the list before we go ahead with the deletion. Once we are happy with the list that will be deleted, we will see in the log that we can remove the log and remove the comment lines, allowing the deletion to take place.</p>
<p>This type of example is useful when performing a large removal of records to gauge the impact before going ahead with the script. </p>
<p>Let's have a look at what the background script will look like:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-464 image-border" src="assets/73762321-666e-49c6-ba62-dd04a5487b8c.png" style="width:101.67em;height:40.83em;"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Figure 6.2: Background script to log records for deletion</div>
<p class="mce-root">Background scripts are very helpful for running script to check results before performing actions, and also to test parts of a script involved in a long process so the process does not need to be walked through each time to test the code.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Workflow scripts</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Workflows use a number of activities to build up a process in ServiceNow. These activities can often be used on a basic level, without the need for scripting. However, to build a more advanced workflow, we can use code to enhance the workflows we build.</p>
<p>Scripts can appear in a number of workflow activities, including approvals and task creation. For approvals, it is possible to add users and groups to approval activities using script. In task creation, we can use script to set values on our task before it is created.</p>
<p>The main area for scripting in a workflow, though, is in the <span class="packt_screen">Run Script</span> <span class="packt_screen">Workflow Activity</span>. This activity allows the developer to run any server-side script they like at a point in the workflow. This can be used to manipulate records, kick off integrations, or perform other outcomes using scripts.</p>
<p>The other area of workflows in which you often come across scripts is in setting up approvals. A simple approval workflow activity will simply pick a user or group to approve, or perhaps the value of a particular field. However, if you require the selection of relevant approvals to be more complicated than this, then you may need to use some code.</p>
<p>With scripts, you can add extra elements to who will be selected to approve, for example, by checking attributes about the users approving, or the record being approved. It may be that if a record has a particular category, it is sent to a certain approval group, or that the approver of the record must have a certain role. This type of functionality is achievable with script and can cater for many other scenarios too. </p>
<div class="packt_tip"><span>The potential for building a complex approval system is huge, but be careful to make sure that what you create provides value and can be maintained.</span></div>
<p>Let us have a look at an example of a workflow script in a <span class="packt_screen">Run Script</span> <span class="packt_screen">Workflow Activity</span>:</p>
<pre>//Adds urgent to the short description if the priority is critical<br/>if (current.priority &lt; 2) {<br/>  current.short_description = current.short_description + ' URGENT';<br/>  current.update();<br/>}</pre>
<p>In the example, we are adding <kbd>URGENT</kbd> to the short description of the record if the priority is critical. We also have access to the current record in the workflow script, with the current record being the one from which the workflow launched.</p>
<p>Let us have a look at what this activity will look like, in <em>Figure 6.3</em>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/3d7f4875-9f7c-4d35-9f77-4bf124e4c267.png"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Figure 6.3: Workflow activity to update the short description based on priority</div>
<p>Workflow script can be particularly handy for adding an extra layer of functionality to your workflows. Sometimes, when you look at the activities available, you cannot find one that will meet your requirements, and in this instance, scripting can be the solution.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Events that trigger different outcomes in an instance <span>run in ServiceNow</span>. An event can be invoked from any script on the server side. The main outcome from an event being triggered is either a notification or a script action. Notifications are usually emails, and we will take a look at script actions later on in this chapter.</p>
<p>First of all, to trigger an event, the event will need to be defined. To define an event, we can navigate to <span class="packt_screen">System Policy</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Events</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Registry</span> and click on the <span class="packt_screen">New</span> button. Upon doing this, we are given the form shown in <em>Figure 6.4</em>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-465 image-border" src="assets/9adebc8d-7c21-48ce-99d8-5cd58cc5415a.png" style="width:105.92em;height:17.33em;"/></div>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref">Figure 6.4: New event form</div>
<p>In the form, we need to give the event a name. Event names are usually words split by full stops and underscores, and if you look at the list of events, you will see the general format used for events. It is also good practice to fill in the table field for reference. The <span class="packt_screen">F</span><span class="packt_screen">ired by</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Description</span> fields are simple text fields, but it is a good idea to fill these in with details of when the event should be fired and how the event is fired. Then, the event can be used by others or its trigger point easily found by another administrator.</p>
<p>Once we have defined an event, we then need to be able to call the event to add it to the event queue. We can use the <kbd>GlideSystem</kbd> method <kbd>eventQueue</kbd>, as shown in the following code:</p>
<pre>gs.eventQueue("custom.event", current, gs.getUserID(), gs.getUserName());</pre>
<p>In the preceding code, we would be calling the event <kbd>custom.event</kbd>, and this would need replacing with the name of the event you have created. The second, third, and fourth parameters are an object and two strings, respectively. The second parameter is almost always the current record, so that the current record data can be used once the event is processed. The third and fourth parameter are more commonly known as <span class="packt_screen">P</span><span class="packt_screen">arm1</span> and <span class="packt_screen">P</span><span class="packt_screen">arm2</span>. These can be used in scripts or in notifications; for example, you are able to send an email to the value held in <span class="packt_screen">Parm1</span>.</p>
<p>In the example, we are sending the current logged-in user's ID and name. The information sent in these parameters often changes, and is often about the current user or a value that is useful once the event has been processed.</p>
<p>We can also use the <kbd>GlideSystem</kbd> method <kbd>eventQueueScheduled</kbd>, which is very similar, except the fifth parameter is the time at which the event should run. This can be set as the value of a field that is of <kbd>glide_date_time</kbd> type.</p>
<p>We can see an example of this in the following code, using the same event from before:</p>
<pre>gs.eventQueueScheduled("custom.event", current, gs.getUserID(), gs.getUserName(), current.dateTimeField);</pre>
<p>Once an event has been triggered, it will be processed fairly quickly, unless it has been scheduled for a certain time, and the events that have been processed can be seen in the event logs. To see the event logs, navigate to <span class="packt_screen">System Logs</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Events</span>. From here we can see the  events processed, the processing time, and events still to be processed.  </p>
<p>Events provide a great way to process multiple scripts or send notifications based on a single event, and because an event can be triggered in any server-side script, the ways in which an event can be triggered are almost limitless.</p>

<p>Script actions tend to be some of the lesser-used methods of server-side scripting. They are run after an event has run in the system scheduler. This can be helpful as a way to run some script at a set point in the future.</p>
<p>There are some system events that will already exist in ServiceNow that you can use to run your script actions from, or you can create your own events and execute them from any server-side script.</p>
<p>When creating a script action, you need to pick the event to run the script action against. This is picked from a list, so make sure the event exists before you create the script action. There is also the option to add a condition script, which is written in the same style as a business rule. You can also perform condition checks in the main script, but if you can use the condition script, it is considered better.</p>
<p>Let's have a look at a script action in use. The main script field can run any server-side script. Here, we will add a simple log:</p>
<pre>gs.log('Approval Inserted');</pre>
<p>This example will send a log to the system logs to say that an approval has been inserted. This is fine as an example or for debugging, but would not be recommended as a script for a production instance, as many approvals are created, and this would swamp the logs with this message.</p>
<p>Let's have a look at the script action itself, shown in <em>Figure 6.5</em>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-466 image-border" src="assets/de0b276d-5d9b-41f6-8b96-fd10f0803567.png" style="width:44.33em;height:16.58em;"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Figure 6.5: Approval-logging script action</div>
<p>Script actions can also be used to set an action to be performed in the future; for example, keeping a record on hold until a certain time in the future.</p>

<p>The advanced server-side techniques we have seen can be used in a number of ways, and you will find advanced server-side scripting to be some of the most common in the ServiceNow platform.</p>
<p>Now that we have seen where to write our advanced server-side code, we can have a look at some further examples to solidify our understanding.</p>
<p>Let's have a look at a script include example first. We will write a script to return the active tasks of a requested item. This can be helpful for letting users know which tasks need to be completed for an item to be fulfilled.</p>
<p>First we will take a look at the script include code:</p>
<pre>var item_utils = Class.create();<br/>item_utils.prototype = {<br/>    initialize: function() {<br/>    },<br/>  <br/>  getActiveTasks: function getActiveTasks(item) {<br/>    <br/>    var tasks = [];<br/>    var task = new GlideRecord('sc_task');<br/>    task.addQuery('request_item', item.sys_id);<br/>    task.addActiveQuery();<br/>    task.query();<br/>    while (task.next()) { <br/>      tasks.push(task.number.toString());<br/>    }<br/>    return tasks;<br/>  },<br/><br/>    type: 'item_utils'<br/>};</pre>
<p>We are using the <kbd>getActiveTasks</kbd> method to get all of the active tasks returned to us, passing in the item parameter as the requested item record to get the tasks for. Using a <kbd>gliderecord</kbd> query, we can find all of the tasks, and are returning them as an array.</p>
<p>In the example, we have started the creation of an item utilities script include. You will often find these in ServiceNow instances having been developed by other developers. We have created the first method here, but you would usually build up more methods for requested items as part of this class to keep the code organized.</p>
<p>We can see what the script include will look like in <em>Figure 6.6</em>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-467 image-border" src="assets/ff0e0038-7e12-46a1-b352-0156b8f9f17f.png" style="width:41.92em;height:25.17em;"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Figure 6.6: Item utilities script include</div>
<p>Now that we have the script include, we need to call it from another location. Here, we will do this from a business rule, and simply log the result. You can use this type of script include to assist in whether to close out requested items, too.</p>
<p>Here is the code for the business rule to call the script include:</p>
<pre>(function executeRule(current, previous /*null when async*/) {<br/><br/>  var tasks = new item_utils().getActiveTasks(current);<br/>  gs.log('Active tasks for ' + current.number + ' are ' + tasks.toString());<br/><br/>})(current, previous);</pre>
<p>We would run this business rule on the requested item table. In the code block, we put the value of the script include into the tasks variable. We also pass the current requested item record using <kbd>current</kbd>. We are just logging the output here, but this data could be used for other uses.</p>
<p>Let us also see what the business rule would look like, in <em>Figure 6.7</em>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-468 image-border" src="assets/e09d3e77-afb0-419a-9e21-5a96f7d59df1.png" style="width:116.50em;height:53.67em;"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Figure 6.7: Business rule to log active requested item tasks</div>
<p>Now, let us have a look at a further example of a scheduled job.</p>
<p>For this example, we will look at deleting all incidents that are over a year old. This kind of example shows how we can remove old records overnight for different tables.</p>
<p>Let us have a look at what the code would look like:</p>
<pre>//Delete incidents that have not been updated in the last year.<br/>var date = new GlideDateTime();<br/>date.addYearsLocalTime(-1);<br/><br/>var delIncident = new GlideRecord('incident');<br/>delIncident.addQuery('sys_updated_on', '&lt;', date);<br/>delIncident.deleteMultiple();</pre>
<p>In this code, we get the current date and time by initiating a new <kbd>GlideDateTime</kbd> class, and then removing a year from this time. By using a negative number, in this case <kbd>-1</kbd>, we subtract a year from the current date and time. Using a <kbd>GlideRecord</kbd> query, we are finding all of the incidents updated over a year ago, and deleting them using <kbd>deleteMultiple</kbd>. This deletes all of the records without the need to query the <kbd>Gliderecord</kbd>.</p>
<p>This type of overnight job can be great for clearing out old records or performing updates, ready for the day ahead.</p>
<p><em>Figure 6.8</em> shows what the scheduled job itself looks like:</p>

<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Figure 6.8: Scheduled job to delete old incidents</div>
<p class="mce-root">As you can see in the preceding figure, this scheduled job would run at 1:00 a.m. and delete the incidents overnight. This is common practice so that system resources are not being used during the working day.</p>
<p>It is also best practice to run long-running scripts overnight so that they do not impact the instance resources during business hours. There are also jobs that run overnight written by ServiceNow included in a brand new instance; for example, the <kbd>import set deleter</kbd>, which cleans up import sets after seven days.</p>
<p>Running overnight scripts is a great way to use scheduled jobs. This can be useful for cleaning up old data or setting up reports so that they are available to users first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>Now, let us have a look at a workflow script example.</p>
<p>Here, we will use an approval activity to add an approval that is the director in charge of the current caller. This involves iterating through managers of users in the database until we find one that is a director.</p>
<p>Let us take a look at the code:</p>
<pre>var manager = 'current.caller_id.manager';<br/>var title;<br/>while (eval(manager) != '') {<br/>  title = manager + '.title';<br/>  if (eval(title) == 'Director') {<br/>    ans = manager + '.sys_id';<br/>    answer = eval(ans);<br/>    break;<br/>  } <br/>  manager = manager + '.manager';<br/>}</pre>
<p>In the example, we use the <kbd>manager</kbd> string to keep adding <kbd>.manager</kbd> to until we find a user that is a director. This means saying the manager of the manager of the manager, and so on, until a director is found. We can execute this in a loop to save time and resources by using <kbd>eval</kbd>. </p>
<p><kbd>eval</kbd> evaluates the contents of the brackets, rather than treating it as its current type: in this case, a string. This allows us to dot walk to find the title of the user and get the <kbd>sys_id</kbd> if we find a director. It is also how we can use a loop here, adding <kbd>.manager</kbd> to the string each time we run through the loop. <kbd>eval</kbd> can be very helpful when using script to find the field you require, and then to evaluate it once it is found.</p>
<p>If no director is found, then no approval will be added at this stage in the workflow, as when we get to the top of the organisational tree we would meet a user with no manager and exit the loop.</p>
<p>We can see the approval activity from the workflow in <em>Figure 6.9</em>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-469 image-border" src="assets/ec3a826e-7951-4fdd-b6f2-c1067c25864f.png" style="width:96.25em;height:43.08em;"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Figure 6.9: Approval activity to find and add the user's director as an approver</div>
<p>For our final example, we will take a look at a script action.</p>
<p>Sometimes we want to put an incident on hold, but incidents can get left on hold for extended periods of time. In this example, we will create a new field to hold a date and time for the incident to stay on hold until. Once the date and time are reached, an event fires which will run our script action and take the incident off hold and move the state to in progress.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, we also need to set the event to be scheduled in the future. Here, we will use a business rule to do this. The code we will need looks as follows:</p>
<pre>(function executeRule(current, previous /*null when async*/) {<br/><br/>  gs.eventQueueScheduled("incident.off.hold", current, current.sys_id, gs.getUserName(), current.u_on_hold_until);<br/><br/><br/>})(current, previous);</pre>
<p>In the business rule, we are using the <kbd>GlideSystem</kbd> method <kbd>eventQueueScheduled</kbd> to put an event into the system scheduler. We have set the third parameter, or what can be referenced as <kbd>event.parm1</kbd>, in later scripts to be the <kbd>sys_id</kbd> of the current incident. You will also notice that the final fifth parameter is the value of our custom field to hold the date and time we want the incident to stay on hold until.</p>
<p>This method sets an event into the system scheduler which will run the event at the time we have set in the custom <span class="packt_screen">on hold until</span> field. The event we are firing (<kbd>incident.off.hold</kbd>) is a custom one we have created for this particular functionality.</p>
<p>Once the event fires, we need to move the incident out of the <span class="packt_screen">on hold</span> state and into in progress. For this, we are going to use our script action.</p>
<p>The code in our script action is as follows:</p>
<pre>var incident = new GlideRecord('incident');<br/>incident.get(event.parm1);<br/>incident.state = '2';<br/>incident.u_on_hold_until = '';<br/>incident.update();</pre>
<p>We are using the <kbd>event</kbd> parameter we set in the business rule to use <kbd>gliderecord</kbd> to get the incident record we want to update. Once we have the record, we can change the state to in progress, with a value of two, and reset the <span class="packt_screen">on hold until</span> field before updating the incident record.</p>
<p>We can also see the full script action in <em>Figure 6.10</em>:</p>

<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Figure 6.10: Script action to take an incident off hold</div>
<p>This combination of business rule and script action is a very useful technique to know for having the ability to run scripts at a specified time in the future.</p>
<p>These practical examples are great for reinforcing the understanding of these more advanced server-side script techniques.</p>

<p>Advanced server-side scripting was the theme for this chapter. We looked at the greatly used script includes and scheduling scripts using scheduled jobs, events, and script actions. We also saw how to write script as part of ServiceNow workflows and how to test aspects of our code using background scripts. We finished off with some great examples of how to use these advanced server-side techniques.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we look at building your own custom pages by utilizing UI pages. We introduce Jelly script and where it appears in ServiceNow, as well as show some examples of creating simple custom pages.</p>
