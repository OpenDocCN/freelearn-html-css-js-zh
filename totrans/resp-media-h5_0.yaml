- en: Take a straw poll of one hundred users and it is likely you will find that a
    good proportion have viewed the Internet from a mobile device at some point in
    the past. Use of these devices to access the Internet has exploded massively over
    the last few years. This has highlighted the need to design sites that work well
    on a variety of different devices and platforms.

- en: First coined as a term by Ethan Marcotte back in 2010, responsive web design
    is the art of designing such sites. A key element of responsive web design is
    the addition of images and videos. Throughout this book, we're going to take a
    look at the tips and tricks you need to get ahead in adding responsive media to
    your sites. We'll see how the lack of a common W3C standard means the field is
    wide open for different solutions and that catering for different platforms means
    understanding their limits and making suitable allowances for each type of device.

- en: We'll work through a number of practical examples, with both images and videos,
    and see the importance of testing both to ensure your content displays as expected
    on any device. We'll then make use of some of the tips and tricks in several real-world
    examples, using popular frameworks such as WordPress or Less CSS—you'll see that
    adding responsive media isn't actually that complicated!

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Working with Responsive Images"), *Working
    with Responsive Images*, starts our journey with responsive media, where we take
    a look at working with responsive media. We''ll cover the basics with a look at
    a wide variety of topics, including retina images, providing fallback support,
    different image formats to use, and catering to the differences between mobile
    and desktop platforms.'

    Responsive Video Content*, continues on from where we left off in [Chapter 1](ch01.html
    "Chapter 1. Working with Responsive Images"), *Working with Responsive Images*,
    with a look at adding responsive video to our sites. We''ll cover the different
    formats available to us and the methods to be used to determine which one to use,
    how to determine the size of the video to use depending on viewport space, providing
    fallback support, and making allowances for different platforms.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Mixing Content"), *Mixing Content*, helps
    us bring it all together with a look at some of the considerations or pitfalls
    of mixing responsive content and how we can reduce delays by using preloaders
    to control when content is loaded and rendered on screen. We''ll work through
    an example of mixing both responsive images and video on the same page, so we
    can see how it works in practice and consider what allowances may need to be made
    for different platforms.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Testing Responsive Media"), *Testing Responsive
    Media*, delves into the world of testing our creations to ensure they work properly.
    We''ll see that there is no need for complicated tools as most of our work can
    be done in a browser; we will also cover some tips to troubleshoot slow performance
    issues and how we can make quick and easy changes to help improve speed.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Using Frameworks"), *Using Frameworks*, finishes
    up the book with a look at three real-world examples of using responsive media
    in popular frameworks; our examples include a look at WordPress, Less CSS, and
    Bootstrap. We''ll take a look at some of the tips and tricks (and plugins) available
    for use in WordPress, adding responsive media to a Bootstrap-enabled webpage,
    and how we can use Less CSS to help better manage our CSS styles.'

    or code editor and a browser (preferably Firefox with Firebug installed). I recommend
    installing Sublime Text—either Version 2 or 3—although if you have your own particular
    preference, that will be fine.
