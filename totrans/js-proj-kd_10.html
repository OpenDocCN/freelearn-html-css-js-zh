You learned how to play with console; solve problems with JavaScript, HTML tags, CSS properties, and control statement; use jQuery; draw with canvas; build projects; and so on. However, have you ever thought about the opportunities that you got by reading the book and learning JavaScript?</p><p>Well, in this chapter, we are going to see why learning JavaScript is important and what are the fields of JavaScript.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec61"/>JavaScript as your first programming language</h1></div></div></div><p>JavaScript is the <a class="indexterm" id="id281"/>easiest language to start learning. It does not need any software to run. A modern browser and notepad are enough to start coding in JavaScript. JavaScript has some of the best online learning materials.</p><p>Websites <a class="indexterm" id="id282"/>such as Codecademy (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.codecademy.com">https://www.codecademy.com</a>), Code School (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.codeschool.com">https://www.codeschool.com</a>), CodePen (<a class="ulink" href="http://codepen.io">http://codepen.io</a>), JS Bin (<a class="ulink" href="https://jsbin.com">https://jsbin.com</a>), and JSFiddle (<a class="ulink" href="https://jsfiddle.net">https://jsfiddle.net</a>) will help you learn JavaScript in short time.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec42"/>JavaScript is everywhere</h2></div></div></div><p>JavaScript is<a class="indexterm" id="id283"/> the only language that runs in almost every browser; even in smartphone browsers. As the web is everywhere, JavaScript is also everywhere.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec43"/>JavaScript developer as profession</h2></div></div></div><p>If you enjoy <a class="indexterm" id="id284"/>programming and want to build your career with programming, JavaScript is one of the best languages for this. I can say it would be difficult to make better choice than JavaScript. If you look at some of the trends in web development, you will see that real-time websites are like desktop applications. Heavy user interactions on websites such as dragging and dropping, audio and video interactions, and visualization of data are common nowadays. All of these are mostly done using JavaScript. Without JavaScript, we would not get the cool web applications (Google Map, Google Earth, Gmail, Facebook, and so on). JavaScript has made everything possible. No other language is as strong as JavaScript when you want to build web applications. The present world is web-based and web is powered by JavaScript in order to make it<a class="indexterm" id="id285"/> beautiful, dynamic, and secure. Therefore, choosing JavaScript with HTML and CSS as your future profession will be one of the best decisions in your life. The developers are known as frontend or full-stack developers.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec62"/>All chores can be done by JavaScript</h1></div></div></div><p>With JavaScript, you <a class="indexterm" id="id286"/>can do a lot of awesome things. From robotics to<a class="indexterm" id="id287"/> web app developing, JavaScript is a strong tool. Let's see how people use JavaScript in their tech life:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Robotics</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">3D games</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Making apps for your smartphones</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Running web servers</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Running Ruby and Python</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Writing OS independent desktop applications</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Web scraping and screenshotting</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Web analytics</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Responsive and interactive contents</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Animation</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Creating cookies</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec44"/>Robotics</h2></div></div></div><p>In robotics, you<a class="indexterm" id="id288"/> need to control your robot with logics. In real world, the logics are handled by microcontrollers. You may have heard of <strong>Arduino</strong>, an <a class="indexterm" id="id289"/>open source hardware that deals with microelectronics. Basically, Arduino controls microcontrollers using C code. However, if you know<a class="indexterm" id="id290"/> JavaScript, you can also code for it; to work with microprocessor/microcontroller and make your first robot. You can get help from <a class="ulink" href="http://nodebots.io/">http://nodebots.io/</a> in order to see how JavaScript is used to<a class="indexterm" id="id291"/> build robots. Following is an image of Arduino UNO board:</p><div><img alt="Robotics" src="img/B04720_10_01.jpg"/><div><p>An Arduino UNO</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec45"/>3D games</h2></div></div></div><p>We have<a class="indexterm" id="id292"/> built and developed 2D games in this book. However, trust me, you can also build awesome 3D games with JavaScript. You can even<a class="indexterm" id="id293"/> play them via your favorite gamepad. To play with<a class="indexterm" id="id294"/> your gamepad, you need to use a gamepad API (<a class="ulink" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/GamepadAPI">https://wiki.mozilla.org/GamepadAPI</a>).</p><p>You can play<a class="indexterm" id="id295"/> few online 3D games build with JavaScript at the following URL: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.babylonjs.com/">http://www.babylonjs.com/</a>.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec46"/>Making apps for your smartphones</h2></div></div></div><p>Have you<a class="indexterm" id="id296"/> ever thought of building an app<a class="indexterm" id="id297"/> for your smartphone? You can build apps for your smartphones with JavaScript. There are different types of platforms for smartphones (for example, Android, iOS, Tizen, Firefox OS, and so on). Every platform has its own APIs and uses different programming languages. Therefore, we need to consider that our code base may run on any device. To make sure about this, we can use<a class="indexterm" id="id298"/> the JavaScript engine as it runs on any platform. You <a class="indexterm" id="id299"/>can use <a class="indexterm" id="id300"/>
<strong>Cordova</strong> (<a class="ulink" href="http://cordova.apache.org/">http://cordova.apache.org/</a>) to understand how to build apps using JavaScript. Cordova is a JavaScript framework based on every device's APIs. You can<a class="indexterm" id="id301"/> use <strong>PhoneGap</strong> (<a class="ulink" href="http://phonegap.com/">http://phonegap.com/</a>) or<a class="indexterm" id="id302"/> <strong>Meteor</strong> (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.meteor.com/">https://www.meteor.com/</a>) to build smartphone apps with JavaScript.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec47"/>Running web servers</h2></div></div></div><p>You <a class="indexterm" id="id303"/>probably have heard of web servers. The server is used to broadcast websites. You can rule your server using JavaScript. JavaScript can handle all the operations and confirms the security of your domains. You can use <a class="indexterm" id="id304"/>
<strong>Node.js</strong> (<a class="ulink" href="https://nodejs.org/">https://nodejs.org/</a>) to run the simplest <a class="indexterm" id="id305"/>web server. To know more about the JavaScript web servers, you <a class="indexterm" id="id306"/>can take a look at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.firebase.com/">https://www.firebase.com/</a>. You may have basic knowledge of JavaScript, which is needed to perform the tasks in a web server. Building a web server with other framework may have a high cost; however, with JavaScript, you can do it for free, You don't even need to buy any software for this.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec48"/>Running Ruby and Python</h2></div></div></div><p>JavaScript also <a class="indexterm" id="id307"/>can be used to run <strong>Python</strong> or <strong>Ruby</strong> on your<a class="indexterm" id="id308"/> browsers with few lines of external <a class="indexterm" id="id309"/>code. You may include the running environment<a class="indexterm" id="id310"/> of these programming languages on your browsers by adding libraries. To learn more about library including and running the codes of Ruby and Python on your browser, you may take a look at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.firebase.com">https://www.firebase.com</a>.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec49"/>Writing OS-independent desktop applications</h2></div></div></div><p>Since <a class="indexterm" id="id311"/>JavaScript<a class="indexterm" id="id312"/> is platform-independent, you can build web applications with the help of JavaScript and run them on any platform. Users on any platform can run the JavaScript-based apps on their browsers. You<a class="indexterm" id="id313"/> can even make desktop applications using JavaScript. Take a look at <a class="ulink" href="http://appjs.com/">http://appjs.com/</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://electron.atom.io/">http://electron.atom.io/</a> to make your first desktop application based on JavaScript.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl2sec50"/>Web scraping and screenshotting</h2></div></div></div><p>The<a class="indexterm" id="id314"/> technique of extracting information from a website is <a class="indexterm" id="id315"/>called web scraping. To learn more about<a class="indexterm" id="id316"/> web scraping you can head to <a class="ulink" href="http://www.webscraper.io/">http://www.webscraper.io/</a>.
