- en: Type-driven development is the practice of using static types to restrict what
    your code can do. Normally, your programming language gives you enough power to
    represent any computation. With type-driven development, you are essentially trying
    to make it impossible for your code to do undesirable things.

    we have linters, such as ESLint ([https://eslint.org/](https://eslint.org/)),
    that check for a lot of possible errors, but you have to remember to find them,
    enable them, and then work around their limitations. A linter can be helpful in
    various other ways, such as by pointing out the recommended best practices in
    a coding style. However, linters in JavaScript are often re-purposed to perform
    static type checking tasks as well; because they offer so much flexibility and
    need to be configured (in fact, people usually upload their preferred sets of
    configuration for different styles of programming), there may be large differences
    in what exactly gets checked across different codebases.

    only possible types allowed for those parts of the function.

    Reason is a JavaScript-like syntax and is also a set of tools for OCaml ([https://ocaml.org/](https://ocaml.org/)).
    OCaml is a mature statically typed functional programming language with excellent
    support for object-oriented and modular programming.

- en: We're going to write Reason code and compile it to JavaScript using the BuckleScript
    compiler ([https://bucklescript.github.io/](https://bucklescript.github.io/)).
    BuckleScript takes input from Reason code and outputs essentially a simple subset
    of ES5 (that is, no ES2015-style classes, no arrow functions, and so on). This
    will allow us to write strongly statically typed code and see what the output
    JavaScript looks like with all the types stripped away.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: BuckleScript, by default, outputs JavaScript files with the extension `.bs.js`
    to distinguish them from your other JS files. You can see this in the example
    output file, `src/Ch01/Ch01_Demo.bs.js`.
