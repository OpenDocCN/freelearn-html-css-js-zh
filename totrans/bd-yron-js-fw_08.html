<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">In this chapter, we now switch focus to the frontend components of the full stack framework that we began building in </span><a href="B19014_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor108"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">Chapter 7</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">This is the final part of adding new features and architecting the technical design for the purposes of our </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">Componium</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1"> framework</span><a id="_idIndexMarker542"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1"> example. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.2">The frontend features are the most complex to design because they require a lot of domain knowledge of browsers, in-depth JavaScript, the ability to handle complex edge cases, and so on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.3">We will cover a series of frontend topics that focus on enabling a full stack framework development environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.4">Here are some of the topics that we </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">will cover:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">Frontend features</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">: We will determine the features and goals of the frontend components for our framework. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">In addition, this new frontend infrastructure needs to interact with the existing components of the full stack framework, such as the backend API routes and the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">testing interfaces.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">Architectural design</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">: After learning more about the low-level interfaces of established frameworks, we will create a framework design that can offer similar features with low-level interfaces of its own. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.2">This includes developing a component, view, and routing architecture to server content to the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">web browser.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">Frontend patterns</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">: Learning about common frontend patterns and optimizations will help us become more accustomed to working with existing frameworks and building new ones in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">the future.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">It is crucial to keep in mind that we can only scratch the surface of the feature set that other frameworks offer out of the box. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.2">For example, we can include a client-side router with a component-based architecture, including reactivity in those components. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.3">Frameworks such as Vue.js, Angular, and Svelte, plus libraries such as React, required years of development to cover all edge cases and significantly expand the feature set. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.4">For the purposes of this chapter, we will focus on keeping things closer to the basics and build several technical parts from scratch. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.5">This should give you a good understanding of the underlying components of other full stack frameworks with frontend features, such as Next.js. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.6">For example, we will use some of the web components APIs that are built right into modern web browsers to enable a rich feature set in our </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">own framework.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">Toward the end of the chapter, we shall also examine the intended workflow to understand the series of steps taken by a developer to utilize the framework interfaces to achieve specific application development goals, using our newly </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">architected features.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">We</span><a id="_idIndexMarker543"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1"> will continue from the previous chapter by reusing the example </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">Componium</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1"> framework project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.2">In </span><a href="B19014_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor108"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">Chapter 7</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">, we created several features that </span><a id="_idIndexMarker544"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">allow us to interact with server-side routes, define APIs, and query a database. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.2">Currently, there is no way to develop frontend components to either consume those APIs or add visual interfaces using our framework. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.3">Without the frontend part of our framework, a developer needing to build an interactive interface, hosted using a Componium server, would need to include an external library and statically serve additional application files from </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">the server.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">Therefore, we will change the lack of frontend features by creating several frontend features that will allow framework users to create client interfaces. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">These frontend features will mimic some of the complex features of the existing established frontend frameworks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.3">For instance, our approach to reactivity features inside the components will include the basics, utilizing the built-in APIs from </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">the browsers.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">To begin this </span><a id="_idIndexMarker545"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">process, we will identify the goals of the features we want to support. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">After that, we will follow with a sample architecture design that will make those features a reality and make our framework genuinely </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">full stack.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-143"><a id="_idTextAnchor142"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">Goals</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">The frontend framework</span><a id="_idIndexMarker546"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1"> sets three goals that will be later supported by the features that we create. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.2">Overall, it is a good idea to define these goals in a general manner and use them as you progress with your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">framework project:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">Web-based interfaces</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">: Goal </span><a id="_idIndexMarker547"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">number one is to empower developers to </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">create web-based interfaces</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1"> while maintaining cohesion with the backend/server components of the framework. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">With the frontend capabilities of the framework, developers will have the ability to write, host, and deploy interactive client interfaces. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.3">These interfaces will be made possible by providing a frontend framework API to create components and attach those to client-based views. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.4">These client-based features should also be testable and debuggable, either by the built-in Componium test interfaces or external </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">testing tools.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">Enable interactivity</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">: A comprehensive set of APIs, both on the server-side and frontend side, will help </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">enable the interactivity</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1"> required by many of the framework-backed projects. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.2">The interactivity features need to enable developers to use familiar technologies such as HTML, CSS, and frontend JavaScript to craft components. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.3">The framework should also have the affordances to be able to include potential external libraries. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.4">For example, if someone wants to create a visualization within their Componium frontend application, then they should easily be able to include external libraries such as Three.js </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">and D3.js.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">Promote reusability</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">: We want to include a set of framework affordances to build complex applications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.2">These could be applications with many frontend differentiated views that include a large number of nested components. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.3">These could also include a set of optimizations for production environments and the ability to manage large application code bases. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.4">Primarily, we also want to </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">promote the reusability</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1"> of code and guide developers to make intelligent decisions when building their applications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.2">An easily extensible feature set can be beneficial to cover a lot of the potential use cases. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.3">If we get the architecture right, it will allow for high degrees </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">of customizability.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">Learning from</span><a id="_idIndexMarker548"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1"> already existing frameworks such as Next.js, we also want to make sure to include some of the more modern features and offer pleasing developer experiences alongside those features. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">These could include code generation affordances, similar to the ones we saw in </span><a href="B19014_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor108"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">Chapter 7</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">To set the framework apart from some of the other solutions, we will also set a goal to use some of the newly shipped Web APIs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.3">Taking advantage of starting from scratch in our project gives us a good opportunity to evaluate the latest developments in the browser platforms, choosing the newly available APIs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.4">As part of our learning goals, we will also try to contrast the difference between our newly developed framework and the established mature frameworks, such as Vue.js </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">and Next.js.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">With these goals in mind, let’s dive into the set of features that can back these </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">goals up.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-144"><a id="_idTextAnchor143"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">Features</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">The</span><a id="_idIndexMarker549"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1"> frontend goals defined in the previous section will help us guide the thought process behind our feature development. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.2">To support the established goals, let us plan out some of the technical features that developers will find useful and expect from the framework. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.3">Here are some substantial features that we will discuss in detail in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">this chapter:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">Serve HTML files and content</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">: To support the features of the interactive interfaces, we will need to add the ability to serve the generated HTML output to browser requests. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.2">We need to ensure that we have the capabilities to serve static content to sustain additional JavaScript code, images, media, and other types of files. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.3">This feature is vital to render content on the client side in a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">web browser.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">Structured application code</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">: We need to grant the ability to define reusable interactive JavaScript components with CSS/HTML templating and styling features. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.2">We will do this using a component-based architectural approach. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.3">The component architecture feature itself will enable the development of user interfaces. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.4">The structured application code that it can help produce will consist of independent and reusable bits of code that serve as the building blocks of the whole web application. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.5">This will support our goals of reusability and providing good application primitives, as it takes advantage of component paradigms, such as reactivity, composability, and modularity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.6">The approach to this feature aims to have each component control its own state and render the interfaces based on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">the state.</span></span><p class="list-inset"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">Supporting </span><a id="_idIndexMarker550"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">the maintenance goals, the component-based approach ensures isolated testing and debuggability of the application code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.2">Here, we channel some of the previous design decisions from other frameworks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.3">For example, in Vue.js, components are structured with JavaScript logic, HTML templates, and the ability to style them </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">with CSS.</span></span></p></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">Composability</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">: Expanding on the previous point, it is important to highlight the composability of application code as an important feature of the framework we want to create. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.2">Defining a nested structure based on how the web browser internal DOM structure, components can then be composed together to create complex user interfaces. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.3">Refer to the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">Components</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1"> section of </span><a href="B19014_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor030"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">Chapter 2</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1"> for a recap of the importance of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">this feature.</span></span></li>

<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">The router</span><a id="_idIndexMarker551"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1"> will adhere to the existing concepts of web application navigation and utilize the relevant Web APIs to modify the browser’s URL and history features. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.2">The inclusion of the router will also be beneficial in creating a more logically </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">organized code.</span></span></li>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.1">Reactivity requires data binding, which is a connection between data and the elements of applications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.2">In the web development world, the data would be provided by JavaScript interfaces, most likely dynamically loaded from some API endpoint. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.3">The elements would be the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.1">HTML/DOM</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.1"> structures in the browser client. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.2">The corresponding browser elements are automatically updated to reflect the changes when the underlying data updates. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.3">In </span><a href="B19014_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor030"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.1">Chapter 2</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.1">, in the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.1">Framework building blocks</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.1"> section, we highlighted the possible ways in which data binding can occur within these reactive components. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.2">We also saw examples of frameworks using one-way or two-way binding. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.3">The flow largely depends on architectural decisions, either allowing the elements to update when data changes or also allowing the elements to update the underlying data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.4">Popular frameworks such as Vue.js and anything that includes React use an implementation of a </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.1">virtual DOM</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.1"> tree to render an application’s state as the data changes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.2">However, there are also examples where projects, such as those involving Svelte and Angular, use the real DOM or </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.1">shadow DOM</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.1"> features to achieve </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.1">similar functionality.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.586.1">To expand further improvements in the future, we can focus optimizations on other application files, such as images, media, and more. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.586.2">The introduction of more complex build tools is also possible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.586.3">For example, we can add </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.587.1">rollup.js</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.588.1"> to enhance the resulting output of the client-side code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.588.2">We have seen example usages of rollup tooling in </span><a href="B19014_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor051"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.589.1">Chapter 3</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.590.1">. </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.591.1">Esbuild</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.592.1"> also </span><a id="_idIndexMarker584"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.593.1">provides additional functionality besides the minification that can be found </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.594.1">at </span></span><a href="https://esbuild.github.io/api"><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.595.1">esbuild.github.io/api</span></span></a><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.596.1">.</span></span></p>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-152"><a id="_idTextAnchor151"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.599.1">Developer experience</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.600.1">The finishing</span><a id="_idIndexMarker585"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.601.1"> touches for our features are to include some improvements to the developer experience. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.601.2">We will do this through thorough documentation of the component system and by providing enhancements to the framework’s </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.602.1">executable file.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.603.1">The documentation should provide clear instructions on the frontend capabilities, such as the definition of multiple Client Views and static file directories. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.603.2">The component structure, composability, and reactivity features also need to be described. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.603.3">For example, this could include a straightforward API to add new client routes and how the framework uses the Lit library to achieve the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.604.1">component-related features.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.605.1">The improvements of the framework executable include the ability to generate the Client View routes, Views, and Components using a scaffolding operation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.605.2">In </span><a href="B19014_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor108"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.606.1">Chapter 7</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.607.1">, we saw an example of generating new API routes; this is a very similar addition. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.607.2">Just as before, with the executable, developers will be able to quickly generate some code and start composing frontend user interfaces. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.607.3">These pre-generated components include the default property configurations for styles and data properties </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.608.1">of objects.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.609.1">Overall, we will demystify as many of the frontend features as possible, focusing on helping developers navigate the complicated intricacies of all the technologies that are in play while building client-side </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.610.1">web applications.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.638.1">Mainly, these </span><a id="_idIndexMarker592"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.639.1">libraries and tools help us enrich our framework features. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.639.2">Our framework can rely on these dependencies to enable efficient project building, component-based architecture, dynamic content rendering, and SSR, resulting in a performant, maintainable, and user-friendly application. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.639.3">With the detailed architecture in place, in the following section, we will explore the developer workflow to create a simple client-side application with Componium’s </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.640.1">frontend features.</span></span></p>
