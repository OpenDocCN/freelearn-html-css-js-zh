<h1 class="chapterTitle" id="_idParaDest-269">Color Palette</h1>
<p class="normal">Just like in painting, we can create color palettes in Clip Studio Paint as well. These palettes are digital values of color that we can save, import, export, and access in different ways to create color schemes and automatically mix colors.</p>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we are going to look at color palette variations, how to use them, and even how to create them. In digital drawing, we can use a palette just like in the traditional way. Having a brilliant line-up of squares set up in front of you, you might feel like it is a serendipity of colors – a chance to encounter interesting color combinations accidentally.</p>
<p class="normal">You’ll also learn how to import them from Photoshop and pick colors from the <strong class="screenText">Sub View</strong> palette. It’s very useful knowledge to have when you start coloring your art on Clip Studio Paint, and by the end of this chapter, you will be able to handle your desired color combinations with a wide range of techniques. Let’s jump into the wonderful world of color!</p>
<p class="normal">The following topics will be covered:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Crafting aesthetics with color palettes</li>
<li class="bulletList">Understanding color pickers</li>
<li class="bulletList">Exploring the Color History, Intermediate Color, and Approximate Color, and Colormixing palettes</li>

</ul>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-270">Technical requirements</h1>
<p class="normal">To get started, you need Clip Studio Paint already installed on your device, and a new canvas opened with a white-colored paper layer. Any size is fine, but I recommend creating a 300 dpi square canvas to go through the content in this chapter.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-271">Creating aesthetics with color palettes</h1>
<p class="normal">When we use<a id="_idIndexMarker1154"/> color, we want to have some early ideas of what theme and atmosphere we want to deliver. I will recommend some ideas that we can use immediately for our creation. The first idea is character theme colors. It’s great fun to come up with the most suitable theme color for each character. We especially need this when we are creating a color manga as characters need to be distinguishable immediately on a page. This is a particularly good idea because, by the time we get to creating character merchandise, we can have even more fun designing with their theme colors!</p>
<p class="normal">Pick a color that describes your character well: should they have an energetic warm color, a cool mysterious color, or a solid dark color? The sample art in <em class="italic">Figure 15.1</em> shows characters with their theme colors.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A group of men in different outfits  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_15_15.1.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 15.1: Sample art of characters with their theme colors</p>
<p class="normal">Another idea is overall color combos to deliver the right impression or emotion behind the artwork. For example, we don’t use primary colors when we want to create a romantic atmosphere but tend to use them to express danger or thrill instead. The samples in <em class="italic">Figure 15.2</em> are art with different color combos.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a cartoon  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_15_15.2.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 15.2: Sample art with various color combos</p>
<p class="normal">From left to right, we can observe romantic, dangerous, kawaii, fresh, and dreamy aesthetics to express the atmosphere, with each color combo supporting them.</p>
<p class="normal">Of course, the preceding images are merely examples. We can edit/create our own. I trained myself by using four or five limited colors to draw a color illustration in one hour with a theme, which helped me tremendously to understand the power of using colors. You can also try it by studying colors from your favorite art/photo and <a id="_idIndexMarker1155"/>drawing with them on your art. By the way, all the above sample artworks were created using Clip Studio Paint, using its color palettes, which will be introduced later in this chapter.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-272">Understanding color pickers</h1>
<p class="normal">For traditional <a id="_idIndexMarker1156"/>painting tools, you need a canvas, brushes, paint colors, and a palette to start. We’re going to have a look at paint colors and various palettes in the digital world in this section. In Clip Studio Paint, similar to other digital drawing tools, the palettes come with colors already on them; how handy!</p>
<p class="normal">When we pick a color for a specific usage, there are some recommendations I can give when you have doubts about your choice. For shading, I add it with a light purple on the <strong class="screenText">Multiply</strong> layer blending mode; you will find how to do it in the <em class="italic">Exploring layer blending modes</em> section in the next chapter of this book. Another tip is that the colors of objects closer to the camera tend to be warmer and more reddish, and those farther away tend to be cooler and blueish.</p>
<p class="normal">There are lots of ways to choose colors in Clip Studio Paint, but the three that are most used are the <strong class="screenText">Color Wheel</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Color Slider</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Color Set</strong> palettes. Each palette gives us a different way to make just about any color we can imagine in our digital illustrations and comics. Let’s take a look at each of these palettes and how to use them to pick colors in the following sections.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-273">The Color Wheel palette</h2>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Color Wheel</strong> <a id="_idIndexMarker1157"/>palette is <a id="_idIndexMarker1158"/>probably the most used method for choosing colors in the digital realm. The Color Wheel palette has two modes, <strong class="screenText">HLS</strong> mode and <strong class="screenText">HSV</strong> mode:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">HLS</strong> mode: This stands for <strong class="screenText">Hue</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Luminosity</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Saturation</strong>. Hue is the degree of variation in the color, luminosity is the brightness of the color, and saturation is how much of the pure color is in the mix (colors get grayer the less saturated they are).</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">HSV</strong> mode: This stands for <strong class="screenText">Hue</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Saturation</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Value</strong>. Hue is the degree of variation in the color, saturation is how much of the pure color is in the mix (colors get grayer the less saturated they are), and value is how much white or black has been added to the color to make the new color.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal"><em class="italic">Figure 15.3 </em>shows the HLS mode of the Color Wheel palette.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_15_15.3.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 15.3: HLS mode in the Color Wheel palette</p>
<p class="normal">The outer ring of colors controls the hue. The triangle inside of the circle shows the pure hue (chosen from the outer circle). As we move up and to the left, the color becomes<a id="_idIndexMarker1159"/> lighter and closer to pure white. As we <a id="_idIndexMarker1160"/>move down and to the left, the color becomes darker and closer to pure black. By clicking inside of the triangle, we can choose any saturation or luminosity of the currently chosen hue.</p>
<p class="normal">With this triangle shape, we can see a triad color combination: the three colors pointed to by the triangle are the ones that create a striking impression when used together in art. So, when you want a vivid and intense atmosphere, imagine there is a triangle in the middle of the color circle, and just turn it around, then pick the three colors each corner is pointing to. </p>
<p class="normal">In the samples in <em class="italic">Figure 15.4</em>, we see the triad with other color combinations that work well.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A close up of different colors  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_15_15.4.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 15.4: Samples of various color combinations</p>
<p class="normal">The bottom-left corner of the palette shows our currently selected foreground and background colors, as well as our transparent swatch. We can quickly select to use the foreground or background color from this palette, or in the primary toolbar in the user interface.</p>
<p class="normal">Along the bottom edge of the palette, we can see the number values of the currently selected <a id="_idIndexMarker1161"/>color for hue, luminosity, and <a id="_idIndexMarker1162"/>saturation, marked <strong class="screenText">H</strong>, <strong class="screenText">L</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">S</strong>, respectively. In the previous screenshot, the hue value is <strong class="screenText">0</strong>, the luminosity value is <strong class="screenText">25</strong>, and the saturation value is <strong class="screenText">95</strong>.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Knowing these number values can help you match the colors that you use, even if you switch to other graphics software. By clicking on the area with the number values, the options can be changed from hue, luminosity, and saturation to the <strong class="screenText">Red, Green, and Blue</strong> (<strong class="screenText">RGB</strong>) values instead.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">The icon at the bottom right of the palette switches our Color Wheel palette to <strong class="screenText">HSV</strong> mode, which is shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.5.</em></p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_15_15.5.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 15.5: HSV mode in the Color Wheel palette</p>
<p class="normal">Like HLS mode, we can choose the hue by clicking along the outer ring in the palette. The upper-right corner of the square shows the pure hue. By moving toward the lower-right corner, the color becomes darker and closer to black. The top-left corner is pure white and choosing a color close to it makes the color lighter in value. Going toward the lower-left corner makes the color less saturated (grayer) and closer to black.</p>
<p class="normal">If we look at<a id="_idIndexMarker1163"/> the rectangle marker at the upper-left<a id="_idIndexMarker1164"/> of the color wheel, we will find a color directly opposite, which is the complementary color. These samples are shown in the color combinations presented in <em class="italic">Figure 15.4</em>. If you use only these two colors in art, it creates the highest contrast, and many pop designs use this technique.</p>
<p class="normal">The numbers under the color picker show the <strong class="screenText">H</strong>, <strong class="screenText">S</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">V</strong> values of the currently selected color.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s look at the next type of palette.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-274">The Color Slider palette</h2>
<p class="normal">The next<a id="_idIndexMarker1165"/> tab in the color palette is the <strong class="screenText">Color Slider</strong> palette<a id="_idIndexMarker1166"/> shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.6</em>. You can bring it up on the screen by clicking <strong class="screenText">Window</strong> on the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu and then clicking <strong class="screenText">Color Slider</strong>.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_15_15.6.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 15.6: Color Slider palette</p>
<p class="normal">The tabs along the left edge of the <strong class="screenText">Color Slider</strong> palette allow us to choose between different ways to select our color. The one shown in the previous screenshot is the RGB mode. Each slider in this mode controls a different amount of color. The top slider controls the amount of red in the current color, the middle slider controls the amount of green, and the bottom slider controls the amount of blue. The swatches along the bottom of the palette window are the current foreground and background colors, as well as our trusty transparent swatch.</p>
<p class="normal">The second tab in this palette is the HSV mode, which is the same as the HSV mode from the Color Wheel palette, but instead of a wheel and square, we have sliders to control each aspect of the color selection.</p>
<p class="normal">The final tab in the Color Slider palette is the CMYK selection. <strong class="screenText">CMYK</strong> stands for <strong class="screenText">Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black</strong> and these are the colors used in printing color images on paper. Although we cannot set our document to be in CMYK mode, we can choose colors based on CMYK values using these color sliders to control the amount of each color present.</p>
<p class="normal">The color sliders are very useful when trying to precisely match a color, say from a logo or used in a website design. If you know the number values of the color, you can precisely enter them, using one of the tabs in the Color Slider palette.</p>
<p class="normal">Read on to find <a id="_idIndexMarker1167"/>out about the third palette, <strong class="screenText">Color Set</strong>. You <a id="_idIndexMarker1168"/>might find it’s easier to use than the previous two.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-275">The Color Set palette</h2>
<p class="normal">The final color <a id="_idIndexMarker1169"/>palette we are going to look at is the Color Set <a id="_idIndexMarker1170"/>palette shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.7</em>. Instead of controlling color by using sliders, you can simply pick a color from a set of colors. This can be accessed on the screen by clicking <strong class="screenText">Window</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Color Set</strong> in the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_15_15.7.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 15.7: Color Set palette</p>
<p class="normal">If you are a Photoshop user switching to Clip Studio Paint and you’ve ever used <strong class="screenText">Color Swatches</strong>, this palette will look familiar to you. The color sets are pre-made swatches of color that you can click on to select. <em class="italic">Figure 15.8</em> shows a sample illustration using colors from the standard color set.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_15_15.8.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 15.8: Illustration created using the standard color set</p>
<p class="normal">We can use <a id="_idIndexMarker1171"/>these<a id="_idIndexMarker1172"/> to select a color close to what we want and then tweak it to the exact shade we want using the Color Wheel palette or the Color Slider palette, or just use the color sets as they are.</p>
<p class="normal">The drop-down menu at the top of the Color Set palette allows us to choose between different sets of colors. The set shown in the preceding screenshot (<em class="italic">Figure 15.8</em>) is the standard color set. Our own custom color sets can be created as well so that we can save colors we use often, say for the main characters in a comic project. It would boost the efficiency of coloring the same character multiple times if all colors for use on one particular character were collected in the same place, and if a color that you normally use first is at the top of the set.</p>
<p class="normal">Follow these steps to create a custom color set:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Click on the wrench icon to the right of the drop-down menu at the top of the <strong class="screenText">Color Set</strong> palette. The window as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.9 </em>will appear.</li>

<li class="numberedList">In the <strong class="screenText">Color Set</strong> palette, click on the <strong class="screenText">Replace color</strong> icon (shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.10</em>) in the lower-right corner and then the foreground color will replace the transparent square.</li>
</ol>

<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">You can create your new color set by picking colors from the canvas with your art to which <strong class="screenText">Color match</strong> has been applied. The<strong class="screenText"> Color match </strong>function<strong class="screenText"> </strong>changes the whole color according to the reference image or a color gradient.</p>
<p class="normal">You can find it by going to the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu, and clicking <strong class="screenText">Edit</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Tonal Correction</strong> |<strong class="screenText"> Color Match…</strong>.<strong class="screenText"> </strong>How to use <strong class="screenText">Color match </strong>is described in the <em class="italic">Using Color Match and filter options </em>section in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 16</em>, <em class="italic">Using Clip Studio Paint to Color Your Manga</em>.</p>
<p class="normal">Once we use it for brainstorming color coordination, we can pick good colors and create a new color set!</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">You have seen two different Color Wheel palettes, the Color Slider palette, and finally, the Color Set palette, and now know how to create your own color set. Having solid color sets will give you the security of not losing great color combinations.</p>
<p class="normal">Now, let’s take<a id="_idIndexMarker1177"/> a look at some of the other tabs in the color <a id="_idIndexMarker1178"/>palette and learn how they can help us add color to our illustrations.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-276">Exploring the Color History, Intermediate Color, and Approximate Color, and Color Mixing palettes</h1>
<p class="normal"><strong class="screenText">Color History</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Intermediate Color</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Approximate Color, and Color mixing</strong> are all palettes located within the Clip Studio Paint interface. Color History allows us to keep track of colors that we’ve already used in our art, and the Intermediate Color and Approximate Color, Color mixing palettes allow us to mix colors in different ways. In this section, we will explore each of these palettes and learn how to use them.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-277">The Color History palette</h2>
<p class="normal">Have you ever painted <a id="_idIndexMarker1179"/>and needed a color you were using a while ago, but it’s so blended in with the colors around it that it’s impossible to get the pure color anymore? The Color History palette is the answer to your prayers, and it’s easy to use to boot!</p>
<p class="normal">Before opening the Color History palette, open a blank document and select a brush or pen tool. Choose a color and scribble on the open canvas. Do this a few more times with several other colors. Before the Color History palette can show us anything, we need to have some colors used on our page so that we have a history built up. The use of the color can be a simple click of the mouse or a stroke of the stylus, so long as the color was used.</p>
<p class="normal">Now that we have used a few colors on the canvas, open the <strong class="screenText">Color History</strong> palette by clicking on <strong class="screenText">Window</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Color History</strong> in the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu, or by clicking on the <strong class="screenText">Color History</strong> tab in the color palette. The <strong class="screenText">Color History</strong> palette should look like <em class="italic">Figure 15.12</em>.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_15_15.12.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 15.12: Color History palette</p>
<p class="normal">The palette will <a id="_idIndexMarker1180"/>show any colors recently used. Click on the square of the required color to make it active again.</p>
<p class="normal">To save the colors from the Color History palette, click on the menu icon in the top-left corner of the palette, then click on <strong class="screenText">Register to color set palette</strong> to save the color swatches. To clear the color history, click on the icon in the top-left corner and select <strong class="screenText">Clear color history</strong>. This will reset the palette and start the color history over again.</p>
<p class="normal">Color History is such a simple little palette without a lot of options, but for a digital painter, it can be a powerful tool and make it much easier to keep consistent colors across an entire piece.</p>
<p class="normal">Next, we are going to see a good palette for picking up in-between colors.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-278">The Intermediate Color palette</h2>
<p class="normal">The Intermediate <a id="_idIndexMarker1181"/>Color palette allows us to create a harmonious combination of colors to use in our illustration and manga. By allowing Clip Studio Paint to do the mixing, we can easily create a color scheme that works together.</p>
<p class="normal">The steps that we will follow to learn how to use this palette work best if you can see the Intermediate Color palette and the Color Wheel or Color Set palette at the same time. This is impossible when the palettes are nestled together, as they are in the default user interface for Clip Studio Paint. We will need to pop out one of the palettes so that we can see them at the same time.</p>
<p class="normal">To pop out the <strong class="screenText">Intermediate Color</strong> palette, locate it in the tabs nested within the color palette. Click on the tab at the top of the palette where the name of the palette is showing. With the mouse button or stylus still held down, drag the <strong class="screenText">Intermediate Color</strong> tab out of the color palette. <em class="italic">Figure 15.13</em> shows the palette in the middle of being dragged out onto the canvas view area.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_15_15.13.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 15.13: Moving the Intermediate Color palette</p>
<p class="normal">Once you have moved the Intermediate Color palette out of the main color palette area, release the mouse button. You should now be able to see the Intermediate Color palette and the Color Wheel or Color Set palette side by side, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.14</em>.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_15_15.14.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 15.14: Two color palettes located side by side</p>
<p class="normal">Once you have <a id="_idIndexMarker1182"/>these palettes next to each other, follow these steps to create a color scheme that works together using the Intermediate Color palette:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Choose a color from the <strong class="screenText">Color Wheel</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Color Set</strong>, or <strong class="screenText">Color Slider</strong> palette windows. This can be any color you wish to use in your color scheme.</li>
<li class="numberedList">With your chosen color as the currently active color, move the cursor over the large square at the top left of the <strong class="screenText">Intermediate Color</strong> palette. The cursor will become a paint bucket icon over the square. Click to add the color to the corner box.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Repeat <em class="italic">steps 1 and 2</em> for any other colors in your color scheme, adding new colors to the other corner boxes. In <em class="italic">Figure 15.15</em>, we have used green in the upper-left corner, red-orange in the upper-right corner, blue in the lower-left corner, and black in the lower-right corner.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_15_15.15.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 15.15: Intermediate Color palette with new colors</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="4">Use the cursor to select colors from the small square color swatches in the center of the <strong class="screenText">Intermediate Color</strong> palette with which to color your image.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">As we add colors to<a id="_idIndexMarker1183"/> the corners of the Intermediate Color palette, the small squares on the inside of the palette are automatically filled with a blend of those colors. This is an easy way to get mixes of colors the way that we would with paint in the real, physical world, but by using digital tools to do our color mixing for us. It is a great palette to show good shade/light colors instantly! The image in <em class="italic">Figure 15.16</em> is an example using the Intermediate Color palette:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A close-up of a color chart  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_15_15.16.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 15.16: Example image of using the Intermediate Color palette</p>
<p class="normal">It’s good to see the intermediate color at a glance when we want to avoid primary colors <a id="_idIndexMarker1184"/>for drawing. Read on to see a more experimental palette, the Approximate Color palette, which can produce accidentally good color coordination for you!</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-279">The Approximate Color palette</h2>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Approximate Color</strong> palette is <a id="_idIndexMarker1185"/>a completely different way of mixing colors. This palette requires some experimentation to get used to it with different color mode sliders, but once you play with it, you may just love it! When we want more nuance in the main color we are using, this palette comes in handy. You can search for a slightly more vivid or grayer shade, and then the palette shows a grid of all possible variations! With just a slight tinge of another color, you can use it to express a bounced light from a nearby object’s color. The Approximate Color palette is shown in <em class="italic">Figure 15.17</em>.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_15_15.17.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 15.17: Approximate Color palette</p>
<p class="normal">Follow these<a id="_idIndexMarker1186"/> instructions to learn how to use the Approximate Color palette:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Open the <strong class="screenText">Approximate Color</strong> palette by either clicking on the tab in the color palette or by clicking on <strong class="screenText">Window</strong> in the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu and clicking on <strong class="screenText">Approximate Color</strong>.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Select a color other than black as the active foreground color. The currently selected foreground color will change the results of the blending in the <strong class="screenText">Approximate Color</strong> palette.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on the text to the right of the top slider to open the pop-up menu of blending options. These options will be discussed in detail later.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on the text below the slider on the left side of the <strong class="screenText">Approximate Color</strong> palette window. Choose an option to blend from this pop-up menu.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Adjust the top and left sliders by moving them and seeing how the colors in the palette change.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on a color square inside of the palette to choose that color as the active foreground color.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">The options next to the sliders in this palette are <strong class="screenText">Hue</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Saturation</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Luminosity</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Luminance</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Red</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Green</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Blue</strong>.</p>
<p class="normal">This list gives details on each of these options:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Hue</strong>: The degree of variation of the color.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Saturation</strong>: The vividness of the color. Higher values result in more vivid colors.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Luminosity</strong>: The value of the color mixed in.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Luminance</strong>: The intensity of vivid brightness of the color.</li>

<p class="normal">The sliders on each axis control how much of the currently selected parameter is being used. For instance, setting both the horizontal and vertical axes to <strong class="screenText">Hue</strong> and setting both slider<a id="_idIndexMarker1187"/> values to <strong class="screenText">100%</strong> produces lots of very saturated colors when a similarly saturated color is the currently active color. <em class="italic">Figure 15.18</em> shows what the <strong class="screenText">Approximate Color</strong> palette looks like when a saturated purple color is chosen and the horizontal and vertical axes are set to <strong class="screenText">Hue</strong>.</p>

<p class="normal">The last palette we will explore is the Color Mixing palette, which offers more visually sensuous way of mixing colors.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-280">The Color Mixing palette</h2>
<p class="normal">The latest color<a id="_idIndexMarker1188"/> palette added to Clip Studio Paint is the Color Mixing palette. It recreates the traditional color-mixing experience that traditional painters do. It works best with oil painting brushes. The sample art in <em class="italic">Figure 15.19</em> is drawn with the Color Mixing palette.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a cartoon  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_15_15.19.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 15.19: Color Mixing palette and art</p>
<p class="normal">Follow these instructions to use the Color Mixing palette:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Click on <strong class="screenText">Window</strong> in the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu and click on <strong class="screenText">Color Mixing</strong>.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Select a color from the color list on the palette, click the brush shape icon, and select the size of the brush from the drop-down menu in the <em class="italic">Figure 15.19</em> to make a mark in the checkerboard area. Click another color you want to mix from the color list. Select the brush again and then draw on top of the mark you have just made.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Select the <strong class="screenText">Blend color</strong> icon, which is the shape of merging two droplets, then scrub on the area where the two colors are overlapping.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Select the <strong class="screenText">Color picker</strong> icon and click on the area where the color is blended. You will see the color you picked is now the <strong class="screenText">Foreground</strong> color.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">You can add more colors to the color list by clicking the <strong class="screenText">+</strong> icon on the far right of the list. Additionally, the <strong class="screenText">Erase </strong>(used to activate the eraser tool), <strong class="screenText">Step backward </strong>(used to undo the last<strong class="screenText"> </strong>action you took), and <strong class="screenText">Step forward</strong> (used to redo the action that have been undone) icons are located under the color list.</p>
<p class="normal">By adding and <a id="_idIndexMarker1189"/>blending colors on the Color Mixing palette, you work just like a traditional painter, which means you can get more direct feelings just like physical color mixing experiences.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-281">Creating color palettes from the Sub View palette</h1>
<p class="normal">In addition to<a id="_idIndexMarker1190"/> all the other wonderful ways<a id="_idIndexMarker1191"/> we’ve explored of selecting colors in this chapter, we can select colors from references that we’ve loaded into the Sub View palette as well. This is easy, convenient, and a real time-saver for those working on comics where the same colors are used for characters or environments over and over.</p>
<p class="normal">Follow these steps to import an image into the Sub View palette and then select colors from it:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Locate the <strong class="screenText">Sub View</strong> palette. It is usually nested with the Navigator. If it cannot be located in the interface, go to the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu and click on <strong class="screenText">Window</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Sub View</strong> to bring it up.</li>
<li class="numberedList">At the bottom of the palette, click on the <strong class="screenText">Import</strong> icon, which is circled in <em class="italic">Figure 15.20</em>.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_15_15.20.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 15.20: Sub View palette</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="3">Locate your<a id="_idIndexMarker1192"/> reference <a id="_idIndexMarker1193"/>image and click on it to select it, then click on the <strong class="screenText">Open</strong> button to complete the import.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Your image will now be visible in the <strong class="screenText">Sub View</strong> palette.</li>
<li class="numberedList">To select colors from the reference image, click on the eyedropper icon circled in <em class="italic">Figure 15.21</em>.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_15_15.21.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 15.21: Sub View palette with an image</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="6">Move the cursor over the image in the Sub View palette and click with the eyedropper to select a color from the reference image. The color will become the currently active color.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">The Sub View palette is a great place to keep regularly used references, such as character concept art, environment designs, and anatomy and pose references. Being able to select colors from it means that colored character references become easy-to-use palettes in their own way. We can select the colors directly from the character concept art and then use them to add color to our comics. Additionally, from scenery<a id="_idIndexMarker1194"/> photos you have taken <a id="_idIndexMarker1195"/>of the sky with golden clouds or a dark forest, you can, of course, use them as a palette!</p>
<p class="normal">For Photoshop users who recently started using Clip Studio Paint, the next section is the one for you!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-282">Importing palettes from Adobe Photoshop</h1>
<p class="normal">If you are <a id="_idIndexMarker1196"/>switching from Adobe <a id="_idIndexMarker1197"/>Photoshop to Clip Studio Paint, there is no reason why you can’t take any custom color swatches you may have created with you to your new software! In this section, we will import Photoshop color swatches into the Color Set palette.</p>
<p class="normal">Before being able to import your Photoshop swatches, you will need to save them from Photoshop to a <strong class="screenText">.aco</strong> file. In Photoshop, you will want to go to the <strong class="screenText">Swatches</strong> palette and click on the menu (it will most likely be in the upper-right corner, depending on your version of Photoshop). Next, click on <strong class="screenText">Save swatches</strong> in the menu. Save the file to a folder on your computer where you will be able to locate it easily. You can also find <strong class="screenText">.aco</strong> files for download on the internet with colors such as Copic Marker inks and more.</p>
<p class="normal">Follow these steps to import a color swatch set from Adobe Photoshop to Clip Studio Paint:</p>

<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-283">Summary</h1>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we began to explore the wonderful world of color. Color is a complex subject, and many studies can be done on using it effectively, but by using the tools and palettes in Clip Studio Paint, we can make it a little bit easier to handle. We learned how to use the Color Wheel, Color Slider, and Color Set palettes. Then, we learned how to use the Color History, Intermediate Color, and Approximate Color, and Color Mixing palettes to track and mix our colors. Finally, we imported color swatches from Photoshop and learned how to select colors from the Sub View palette and imported color swatches from Photoshop. For certain, these functions will help you color your art in future creations, keep your favorite colors, or build beautiful color combinations.</p>
<p class="normal">So, how do we apply these colors to our digital art? In the next chapter, we will learn how to create color flats, use layer blending modes, and color our ink layers, and use Color Match. It’s going to be a packed chapter, so let’s get going right away!</p>
