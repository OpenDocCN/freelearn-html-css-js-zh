<h1 class="chapterTitle" id="_idParaDest-58">Penciling: Layer and Layer Property Palettes</h1>
<p class="normal">Most people have probably heard the <a id="_idIndexMarker129"/>word <strong class="keyWord">penciling</strong> before. Penciling is a stage of the manga or comic creation process in which an artist sketches out a layout of the page with their pencil before they move on to the “inking” stage. In Clip Studio Paint, we have a great function for it! One of the best features of working in a digital art program is the ability to work in <strong class="keyWord">layers</strong>. We can use layers to edit and separate finished pencil artwork from ink artwork, and you will find tons more benefits as we read through this chapter!</p>
<p class="normal">Layers are like stacks of transparencies used for projection: every transparency carries a bit of text or an element of the image, so that we can separate the pencil sketch layer from the inked art layer, and when all the transparencies are stacked on top of each other, they form the complete image. You can make each layer visible or invisible with only one click, and manipulation of one layer doesn’t affect the other layer’s art. Most digital art software allows the creation of layers, and Clip Studio Paint is no exception. This chapter is all about the layers!</p>
<p class="normal">The topics discussed in this chapter will include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Penciling</li>
<li class="bulletList">The Layer palette</li>
<li class="bulletList">Properties of layers</li>
<li class="bulletList">Different types of layers</li>
<li class="bulletList">Layer groups and layer colors</li>
<li class="bulletList">Layer effects</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Let’s jump right in!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-59">Technical requirements</h1>
<p class="normal">To get started, you need Clip Studio Paint installed on your device and a new blank canvas ready. Any size is fine, but I recommend creating a 300 DPI square canvas to go through the content in this chapter. You can create it by clicking <strong class="screenText">File</strong>, selecting <strong class="screenText">New file…</strong>, selecting the <strong class="screenText">illustration</strong> icon, and then clicking <strong class="screenText">OK</strong>.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-60">What is penciling?</h1>
<p class="normal">Penciling is one of<a id="_idIndexMarker130"/> the manga creation stages in which you draw a pencil sketch referring to a manga script before the inking stage. In the manga process, there’s often a first-draft pencil sketch and a second-draft pencil sketch. The first one is <a id="_idIndexMarker131"/>called <strong class="keyWord">Ne-mu</strong>, pronounced like “Name,” which is a very rough pencil drawing, with panels and speech bubbles to create an overall page draft.</p>
<p class="normal">We do this to get a good visual plan of the page, and it’s important to show it to an editor, a designer, and/or a scriptwriter if you’re working with a publisher. After getting approval, we move on to a second pencil sketch, which is more detailed and easier to work on with inking pens. In the image on the right, we can see the whole process of the manga page creation, including the Ne-mu on the very left top and the second penciling sketch next to it:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_03_01_New.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.1: A sample image of a manga page creation process</p>
<p class="normal">When we draw Ne-mu with Pencil tools, what we care about is the layout, so only basic figures are fine at this stage as long as it’s clear which character the figure is. I often write an initial of the character’s name on the face of the figure. We can see how <a id="_idIndexMarker132"/>figure drawings are composed in the following sketches:</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="A drawing of two people  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_03_02_New.png"/></p>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.2: A penciling image of various proportions</p>
<p class="normal">The penciling sketch is a good place to start. Keep working on the rough figure until the proportions look right. The heads rule shown here is a good start! You may need to spend some time getting the head, arms, and legs the right sizes. It may be frustrating at first, but once you’re happy with the overall shape, you won’t have to worry about it again as you go into more detail with clothes, expressions, and so on. Of course, the more you practice proportions, the more intuitively they’ll come to you.</p>
<p class="normal">Sometimes, we realize we want to change the character’s pose after drawing the figure, but still want to refer to the original pose without erasing it. Layers come in handy in this case. Simply create a new layer, use a different colored pencil tool, and start drawing alternative poses on the new layer.</p>
<p class="normal">We can also use <a id="_idIndexMarker133"/>layers when we have different elements on one panel overlapping each other. Each element is drawn on a different layer, so we can move one element around at a time without affecting other drawings.</p>
<p class="normal">We can see these two cases in the following image:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A comparison of a cartoon character  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_03_03_New.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.3: Sample images of multi-layer penciling</p>
<p class="normal">As we can see, your first sketch can still be useful even if isn’t quite right. It’s important when you are starting out to not be too critical or erase too much! It would have been more difficult to draw the blue alternative pose shown here if we didn’t have the black original pose as a reference. Penciling is a good time to make mistakes, so long as you iron them out before inking.</p>
<p class="normal">That’s right, we<a id="_idIndexMarker134"/> benefit a lot from using layers on digital drawings. Let’s have a closer look at what they are.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-61">What is a layer?</h1>
<p class="normal">A layer, in a piece of<a id="_idIndexMarker135"/> digital art, is a magical thing that can make our workflow smoother and easier, and it can also save a lot of headaches in the future when we go from pencils to inks to colors too. Okay, so maybe it’s not <em class="italic">actually</em> magic, but it’s pretty darn close!</p>
<p class="normal">Layers are like stacks of transparencies used for projection: every transparency carries a bit of text or an element of the image, so that we can separate the pencil sketch layer from the inked art layer, and when all the transparencies are stacked on top of each other, they form the complete image. You can make each layer visible or invisible with only one click, and manipulation of one layer doesn’t affect art on another layer.</p>
<p class="normal">But what are layers and how do they work? Let’s look at the following example images. Now that the sketch has been done, the art can be completed by inking and coloring on it. The colored drawing in this screenshot is made from five layers on top of it:</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_03_04_New.png"/></p>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.4: A sample colored drawing</p>
<p class="normal">What exactly are those <a id="_idIndexMarker136"/>layers? In the following screenshot, we can see exactly what they are:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_03_05.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.5: Layer diagram of a colored piece of art</p>
<p class="normal">Here, we can see the transparencies that we mentioned earlier. Every transparency has its own bit of text or part of the image, and when they are stacked on top of each other, they form the complete image. The pink background is a paper layer. On top of that, there is a layer with some gray, which is the carpet the character is standing on. Then, there is a layer with most of the colors of the drawing. Above that is the actual line art (ink) for the character. Finally, on top is a layer with white dots for the shining effect.</p>
<p class="normal">It’s entirely possible to create digital art without using layers, but layers can make your digital art<a id="_idIndexMarker137"/> life easier. Here’s a list of things you can do with layers:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Manipulate, add extra, or organize pencil sketches</li>
<li class="bulletList">Change and edit inks even after coloring started</li>
<li class="bulletList">Add special effects to certain parts of an image</li>
<li class="bulletList">Easily correct color using adjustment layers, blending modes, and layer masks</li>
<li class="bulletList">Revert your image to inks only if a mistake is made in coloring</li>
<li class="bulletList">Change the color of the line art without affecting the other parts of an image</li>
<li class="bulletList">Separate out individual characters or elements for reuse in other images</li>
<li class="bulletList">Organize image elements</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">There are many more benefits to using layers. Of course, there are also some downsides. Depending on how many layers you choose to use, the number of layers may begin to slow down computers with less RAM and disk space. Keep this in mind, especially when working on larger images with a high DPI.</p>
<p class="normal">Now that we know what layers are and why we’d want to use them, let’s explore the <strong class="screenText">Layer </strong>palette<a id="_idIndexMarker138"/> and talk about different types of layers.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-62">Introducing the Layer palette</h1>
<p class="normal">Just like most options in <a id="_idIndexMarker139"/>Clip Studio Paint, layers have a palette that acts as a <em class="italic">command center</em> for managing and creating layers. When we look at the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette in the following screenshot, we can see that there are many icons and options that apply to different layers:</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_03_06.png"/></p>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.6: A screenshot of the Layer palette</p>
<p class="normal">If you cannot locate the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette in your Clip Studio Paint interface, go to <strong class="screenText">Window</strong> in the <strong class="screenText">File </strong>menu and click on <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> to display it.</p>
<p class="normal">There are two drop-down menus and a slider on the top row. The first drop-down menu on the left is used to decide the palette color, changing the color of the icons next to the layer name in the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette. It is used to organize layers easily by grouping them by color. For instance, when making an image with many characters, each layer related to one character can be assigned a layer color for easy identification.</p>
<p class="normal">The second drop-down menu on the left is <strong class="screenText">Blending Mode</strong>, which applies different color effects to the drawings beneath the layer. A full explanation of <strong class="screenText">Blending Mode</strong> can be found in <em class="italic">Chapter 16</em>, <em class="italic">Using Clip Studio Paint to Color Your Manga.</em></p>
<p class="normal">To the right of the <strong class="screenText">Blending Mode</strong> drop-down menu is a slider. This controls the opacity of the layer. Opacity refers to the amount of transparency that the objects on the layer have. If the slider is set to <strong class="screenText">100</strong>, then the layer contents are at full opacity. If it is set to zero, then the layer contents will be completely transparent and therefore invisible. I normally set the sketch layer opacity to 30% when I start inking <a id="_idIndexMarker140"/>on the layer above it so that we can see the inked line clearly!</p>
<p class="normal">Below <strong class="screenText">Blending Mode </strong>and the opacity slider is a group of icons. The following is a list of them from left to right and a description of what each one does:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_03_07.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.7: A screenshot of the icons</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Clip to layer below</strong>: This hides some parts of the image in the current layer using the layer below. Content in the current layer will only be shown in areas where there is also content in the layer below. This is a very useful function for coloring when you need to color in a limited area. For example, we can use this for skin color, clothing patterns, and shading. In the following screenshot, the cheek color layer is clipped by the below skin color layer, so that the cheek color doesn’t exceed the outside of the face:</li>
</ul>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_03_08.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.8: A screenshot of the Clip to layer below function</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Set as reference layer</strong>: Some tools, such as the <strong class="screenText">Fill</strong> tool, can be set to reference their <a id="_idIndexMarker141"/>parameters with another layer. This icon turns the currently selected layer into a reference layer for these tools. Using this setting stops the color overflowing the borders drawn on the reference layer. We can also link it to the <strong class="keyWord">Anti-overflow</strong> setting on brush tools, which you can find in the <em class="italic">Anti-overflow</em> section in Chapter 4, <em class="italic">Introducing Clip Studio Paint Brushes</em>.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Set as draft layer</strong>: This option turns the layer into a draft layer. Exporting and printing images can be set to ignore a draft layer, even if that layer is visible in the file.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Lock layer</strong>: This sets the layer so that it cannot be drawn on or changed at all until it is unlocked.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Lock transparent pixels</strong>: This sets the layer so that transparent pixels cannot be drawn on. Only pixels that are currently drawn on will be able to be changed.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Enable mask</strong>: This enables or disables the layer mask, which can hide some parts of an image. This is a great function to add patterns to clothing! You can learn more about layer masks in <em class="italic">Chapter 12, Making Layer Masks and Screentones</em>.</li>
<li class="bulletList">Once you click the <strong class="screenText">Apply mask to layer</strong> icon, mark any areas that you don’t want to edit and pick the deselect option. With those areas masked, you can edit your art without affecting those areas.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal-one">As an example, the following image shows masks applied on clothing pattern layers. The black areas in the thumbnails are the parts that are masked <a id="_idIndexMarker142"/>with the deselect option:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><strong class="screenText"><img alt="A screenshot of a video game  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_03_09.png"/></strong></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.9: A screenshot of the Layer mask function</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Set showing area of ruler</strong>: This controls what layers or layer folders the ruler is visible on, such as only being visible when in the layer that contains the ruler or being able to see the ruler from any layer of the drawing.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">The following screenshot is of another set of icons called the command bar. This set of icons allows us to execute many common layer<a id="_idIndexMarker143"/> operations directly from the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette. It looks as follows:</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="img/3.8.png"/></p>
<p class="normal">Below or above the command bar, depending on the device you use, is a list of the current layers of your image.</p>
<p class="normal">As you can see in the following screenshot, each one has a symbol that looks like an eye that indicates whether the layer is visible. You can check on your inking process by clicking this eye icon to hide the sketching layer. Similarly, you can check on any art underneath by making the above layers invisible.</p>
<p class="normal">To the right of the<a id="_idIndexMarker144"/> eye icon of the currently active layer, there is an icon that looks like a pen. This indicates that this layer is the one that’s currently being worked on. Above the layer name, the current blending mode says <strong class="keyWord">Normal</strong> in the image, and you can find more about the layer blending mode in the <em class="italic">Exploring layer blending modes</em> section in <em class="italic">Chapter 16</em>, <em class="italic">Using Clip Studio Paint to Color Your Manga</em>. It also tells us the opacity, which is at <strong class="keyWord">100%</strong>. These details are displayed so that specific layers can be found easily:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_03_11.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.11: A screenshot of the layer list</p>
<p class="normal">Now that we’ve <a id="_idIndexMarker145"/>learned all about the <strong class="screenText">Layer </strong>palette, let’s look at its companion: the <strong class="screenText">Layer Property</strong> palette.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-63">The Layer Property palette</h1>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Layer Property</strong> palette<a id="_idIndexMarker146"/> is shown above the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette in the default interface layout. If you cannot find the <strong class="screenText">Layer Property</strong> palette, it can be restored by going to the <strong class="screenText">File </strong>menu and clicking on <strong class="screenText">Window | Layer Property</strong>.</p>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Layer Property</strong> palette has fantastic functions to add on top of the ones of the Layer palette. It is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_03_12.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.12: A screenshot of the Layer Property palette</p>
<p class="normal">Though it’s a little palette, it can <a id="_idIndexMarker147"/>do big things. Let’s explore each of its options now.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-64">Border effect</h2>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Border effect</strong> icon, which <a id="_idIndexMarker148"/>is the first<a id="_idIndexMarker149"/> icon on the left of the top row, can be used to get two different looks on a layer. The most common way to use it is to add a stroke to the outside of the content of a layer.</p>
<p class="normal">To do this, click on the left-most icon of the <strong class="screenText">Border effect</strong> options to activate the <strong class="screenText">Edge</strong> option. The following is a screenshot of <strong class="screenText">Border effect</strong> in action on a layer of text:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_03_13.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.13: A screenshot of a text sample and the Layer Property palette</p>
<p class="normal">By adjusting the <strong class="screenText">Thickness of edges</strong> setting, the thickness of the border can be made thicker or <a id="_idIndexMarker150"/>thinner by <a id="_idIndexMarker151"/>adjusting the slider or using the up and down arrows to the right of the slider. <strong class="screenText">Edge color</strong> can be set by clicking on the rectangle showing the current color and choosing a new color using the color picker window.</p>
<p class="normal"><strong class="screenText">Border effect</strong> also has another setting, though, and that is the <strong class="screenText">Watercolor edge</strong> effect. This effect looks very different from other edge effects and has a lot more options, and it can be used to give a piece of art a slick look that is reminiscent of traditional watercolor.</p>
<p class="normal">To access the <strong class="screenText">Watercolor edge</strong> effect, click on the icon next to the <strong class="screenText">Edge</strong> option under the <strong class="screenText">Border effect</strong> heading of the <strong class="screenText">Layer Property</strong> palette.</p>
<p class="normal">In the following screenshot, the <strong class="screenText">Watercolor edge</strong> effect has been applied to the brushstroke on the right:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_03_14.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.14: A screenshot of an image sample with the Watercolor edge effect applied</p>
<p class="normal">Notice how the stroke on the right has a dark edge around the outside, which is just how watercolor paint would react if it was layered over dry paint. The look of this effect can be changed by moving the <strong class="screenText">Area</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Opacity</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Darkness</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Blurring width</strong> sliders. There is no <em class="italic">ideal</em> setting for this option, but moving the sliders around will update the layer in real time, so it’s very easy – and fun – to play with.</p>
<p class="normal">When we apply this as a layer property, we’re affecting the whole layer. If you want to add a watercolor edge effect only to a specific brush, see the <em class="italic">Watercolor edge</em> section in <em class="italic">Chapter 4,</em> <em class="italic">Introducing Clip Studio Paint Brushes</em>.</p>
<p class="normal">Now that <a id="_idIndexMarker152"/>we <a id="_idIndexMarker153"/>know about the <strong class="screenText">Border effect</strong> option, let’s explore another: the <strong class="screenText">Extract line</strong> effect.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-65">Extract line</h2>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Extract line</strong> icon is <a id="_idIndexMarker154"/>another icon<a id="_idIndexMarker155"/> under the <strong class="screenText">Effect</strong> options in the <strong class="screenText">Layer Property</strong> palette. This option is only available in the EX version and is especially useful for incorporating 3D objects into your art. This is usually used as a stencil, on top of which you can draw the object.</p>
<p class="normal">In the following screenshot, I have taken a photo of some scenery and used the <strong class="screenText">Extract line</strong> effect on it. It’s always better to use a photo that is properly focused, and taken in enough light with high contrast. The settings used are shown in the <strong class="screenText">Layer Property</strong> palette<a id="_idIndexMarker156"/> in the following screenshot:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_03_15.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.15: A screenshot of a line extraction image</p>
<p class="normal">Using this option turns the photo into a line drawing. By adjusting the options in the <strong class="screenText">Layer Property</strong> palette, we get a real-time preview of the line drawing. Using this layer effect does not change the source photo permanently, as the effect can be turned off at any time if we change our mind, so feel free to play around with the sliders!</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Important note</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Only use photographs in your art that you have taken yourself or that you have permission to use. Remember, just because you found a photo through a Google search doesn’t mean that you have the right to use it! Be sure that the owner of the photo is okay with it being used, even if you’re not going to be selling the piece of art that you’re making.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">This option also has another<a id="_idIndexMarker157"/> effect, called <strong class="screenText">Convert to lines and tones</strong>. This is mostly used by<a id="_idIndexMarker158"/> comic artists on 3D <a id="_idIndexMarker159"/>objects or background photographs, but we can also keep using it on our scenery photo. Once we have the settings shown in the preceding screenshot just how we want them, we can click on the<strong class="screenText"> Convert layer to lines and tones</strong> button at the bottom of the <strong class="screenText">Line Extraction</strong> settings. The following dialog will appear:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_03_16.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.16: A screenshot of the line and tone conversion of layer settings</p>
<p class="normal">Settings can <a id="_idIndexMarker160"/>be <a id="_idIndexMarker161"/>modified in this window again before continuing. To see the changes being made, make sure to check the <strong class="screenText">Preview</strong> checkbox below the <strong class="screenText">Cancel</strong> button. Note that the preview may be slow on computer systems with a low amount of RAM or hard disk space.</p>
<p class="normal">When we click on <strong class="screenText">OK</strong>, we will get something like this:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_03_17.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.17: A screenshot of a photo with the Layer palette</p>
<p class="normal">Clip Studio Paint <a id="_idIndexMarker162"/>automatically <a id="_idIndexMarker163"/>creates an outline layer and several layers of tones, depending on the settings we specified in the previous window. Looking in the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette, we can also see our original image safely saved on a layer below the tones and the outline layer. This means we don’t have to worry about making changes to a photo and then not being able to undo them. If we don’t like the final result of the conversion, the action can be undone, or the layers deleted, and we can try again to get a different result. The ideal result would blend nicely with your other drawings on the image, as we can see in the following sample:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_03_18.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.18: A sample image with a photo background</p>
<p class="normal">Remember <a id="_idIndexMarker164"/>that, to keep your style<a id="_idIndexMarker165"/> consistent, it’s best to draw over the automatically created background.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-66">Tone</h2>
<p class="normal">The next icon<a id="_idIndexMarker166"/> in our <strong class="screenText">Layer Property</strong> effect<a id="_idIndexMarker167"/> options is the <strong class="screenText">Tone </strong>effect. Just as the name implies, this takes our layer and turns it into screentones, depending on the contents of the layer.</p>
<p class="normal">What is a screentone? If you read Japanese manga, you’ve probably seen screentones but never knew what they were called! A <strong class="screenText">screentone</strong> is<a id="_idIndexMarker168"/> a pattern of dots, lines, or hatches used to apply shading or texture to any area. In traditional pen-and-paper drawing, these tones were applied using a sticker-like sheet of pre-printed patterns that would be applied over the top of the drawing. Some companies even started printing background images, such as photos of city skylines or forests, to make the comic creation process faster and easier. This is now easy to create using digital tones. Using digital tones means we don’t have to replenish our screentone supplies, because we never run out, and we can make custom tones. We can find more about using screentones in the <em class="italic">Adding screentones</em> section in Chapter 12, <em class="italic">Making Masks and Screentones</em>.</p>
<p class="normal">In the following screenshot, the <strong class="keyWord">Tone</strong> layer effect has been applied on a layer containing a shade of a drawing:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_03_19.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.19: A screenshot of a piece of art with a Layer Property palette</p>
<p class="normal">We also <a id="_idIndexMarker169"/>have<a id="_idIndexMarker170"/> several options for this effect, such as setting <strong class="screenText">Frequency</strong>, which will make the screentone dots more or less numerous. Note that the higher the number set with this slider, the smaller the dots will become. <strong class="screenText">Density</strong> can be set in accordance with the color or brightness of the image. Changing this setting to increase the brightness will make lighter parts of the image more transparent. <strong class="screenText">Dot settings</strong> can be used to change the shape of the dots that make up the screentone pattern. There are many options, from<a id="_idIndexMarker171"/> the <a id="_idIndexMarker172"/>standard circle to stars, flowers, hearts, and more!</p>
<p class="normal">Now, let’s talk about the last effect option.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-67">Layer color</h2>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Layer color</strong> effect <a id="_idIndexMarker173"/>is simple and is<a id="_idIndexMarker174"/> the one that you will use most for day-to-day artwork. Here’s an example of the Layer color effect on a pencil sketch in the following screenshot:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_03_20.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.20: A screenshot of a pencil sketch with a Layer color effect</p>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Layer color</strong> option takes the contents of the selected layer and tints them based on the color set by the user in the <strong class="screenText">Layer color</strong> selection box. By default, this is set to a light blue color that is reminiscent of non-photographic blue pencil art from traditional comics. This is a non-destructive way to tint our layer, as we can simply click on the <strong class="screenText">Layer color</strong> icon again to change the layer back to its original colors.</p>
<p class="normal">The most <a id="_idIndexMarker175"/>common<a id="_idIndexMarker176"/> way to use this option is to make your finished pencil sketch layer blue before inking.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-68">Expression color</h2>
<p class="normal">The final part of<a id="_idIndexMarker177"/> the <strong class="screenText">Layer Property</strong> palette<a id="_idIndexMarker178"/> is the <strong class="screenText">Expression color</strong> drop-down menu. This menu is shown in the following screenshot:</p>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.21: A screenshot of the Expression color options</p>
<p class="normal">With this menu, we can set the color mode of each layer in our document. For instance, for crisp line art, we could set our ink layer to be only black and white pixels by selecting the <strong class="screenText">Monochrome</strong> option. Layers for pencil sketches can be set to <strong class="screenText">Gray</strong>, and only layers that contain color content can be set to <strong class="screenText">Color</strong>. This control over the individual layers’ color modes can help to reduce file sizes in large files with lots of layers, so keep that in mind when you’re working!</p>
<p class="normal">Now that we know <a id="_idIndexMarker179"/>what the icons<a id="_idIndexMarker180"/> and menus in the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Layer Property</strong> palettes do, let’s explore some things that you can do with layers.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-69">Organizing layers</h1>
<p class="normal">Layers are a <a id="_idIndexMarker181"/>powerful digital art software tool, but only if you know how to use them effectively. Many artists switching from doing their pieces on paper have a difficult time figuring out how to work in layers. In this section, we are going to create a few new layers and keep them organized by renaming them and changing their color in the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette.</p>
<p class="normal">Follow these steps in order to create a new file with layers set up to take a drawing from a rough draft to ink:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Create a new file. Use the <strong class="screenText">A4 Color</strong> template under the <strong class="screenText">Show all comic settings</strong> icon for more information on creating new files and using templates. If you are using Clip Studio Paint EX, don’t turn on the <strong class="screenText">Multiple Page</strong> option for this file. We just want one page to work on for this exercise.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Once we have hit <strong class="screenText">OK</strong> and our file is created, we should have a <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette that looks as on the right:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_03_22.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.22: A screenshot of the Layer palette with a new layer</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="3">Double-click on the words <strong class="screenText">Layer 1</strong> in the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette to rename the layer. When the text entry box appears, name the layer <strong class="screenText">Roughs</strong>. Hit the <em class="italic">Enter</em> key on your keyboard to confirm the new layer name. Now, our <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette looks like on the right:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_03_23.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.23: A screenshot of a layer with a new name</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="4">Use the <strong class="screenText">Change Palette Color</strong> drop-down menu to change the <strong class="screenText">Roughs</strong> layer to blue. This <a id="_idIndexMarker182"/>is to allow us to quickly identify the <strong class="screenText">Roughs</strong> layer in the stack of layers. Now, our <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette looks like this:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_03_24.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.24: A screenshot of the Layer palette</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="5">Create a new layer by either clicking on the <strong class="screenText">New Raster Layer</strong> icon above and left of the layer or at the bottom of the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette, depending on your interface or device. You can also go to <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> | <strong class="screenText">New Raster Layer</strong> in the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu at the top of the screen. Raster layers suit organic drawings, whereas Vector layers suit geometric shapes with super smooth lines, and avoid pixelation when blown up to a bigger size. Using the process outlined in <em class="italic">Steps 3</em> and <em class="italic">4</em>, name this new layer <strong class="screenText">Finished pencils</strong> and set the color to green. Now, our <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette <a id="_idIndexMarker183"/>should look as it does in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_03_25.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.25: A screenshot of three layers</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="6">Using the preceding steps, create another layer with the name <strong class="screenText">Inks</strong> and set <strong class="screenText">Palette Color</strong> to <strong class="screenText">Red</strong>.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Now, we are going to create a <strong class="screenText">Layer Folder</strong> to hold our <strong class="screenText">Roughs</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Finished pencils</strong> layers. Create a <strong class="screenText">Layer Folder</strong> by clicking on the <strong class="screenText">Finished pencils</strong> layer in the stack to select it (the currently selected layer will display as blue in the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette). Now, click on the <strong class="screenText">New Layer Folder</strong> icon at the top of the palette (or at the bottom of the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette, depending on your device). Also, you can use <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> | <strong class="screenText">New Layer Folder</strong> in <a id="_idIndexMarker184"/>the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu. Now, our <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette looks like this:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_03_26.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.26: A screenshot of four layers and a folder</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="8">Double-click on the words <strong class="screenText">Folder 1</strong> to bring up the text entry box to rename the folder. Change the name to <strong class="screenText">Pencils</strong> and press the <em class="italic">Enter</em> key on the keyboard to finalize the name change.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Select the <strong class="screenText">Finished pencils</strong> layer and hold down the <em class="italic">Shift</em> or <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> button on the keyboard as you click on the <strong class="screenText">Roughs</strong> layer in order to select both pencil layers at the same time. Both layers will turn blue when they are selected together. Now, use the mouse to drag the layers into the <strong class="screenText">Pencils</strong> folder. You will know they are in the correct position when a red rectangle is shown around the folder while the mouse is <a id="_idIndexMarker185"/>over it, as in the following screenshot on the right.</li>
</ol>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.27: A screenshot of us adding layers to a folder</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="10">Release the mouse button to complete the move to the layer folder.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Save your file. We will be drawing on these layers in the next chapter.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">We now have a<a id="_idIndexMarker186"/> stack of layers (and a layer folder) that looks like this:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_03_28.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.28: A screenshot of layers in a folder</p>
<p class="normal">Tidying up layers into folders brings you another benefit aside from the organization clarity – you can move, edit, change opacity, and add layer blending mode effects on all layers in the folder at once!</p>
<p class="normal">Of course, this is just one of the many ways to use and organize layers. As you continue to work in digital layers, you will find your own style of using them. Some artists use many, many layers in a completed work, while some may only use a few layers.</p>
<p class="normal">Personally, I try to keep my layers down to a minimum, but larger color pieces with lots of <a id="_idIndexMarker187"/>characters can quickly see the stack get pretty high!</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Do you have lots of layers and are you having a hard time finding the one that you need to work on? Change <strong class="screenText">Thumbnail display settings</strong> to display only the area in which some elements are drawn in the thumbnails in the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette. <strong class="screenText">Thumbnail display settings</strong> can be found by clicking three bars next to the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> tab name<strong class="screenText">. </strong>In the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> drop-down menu, click <strong class="screenText">Thumbnail display settings</strong>, and click <strong class="screenText">Show only layer area</strong> as in the following image:</p>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 3.29: A screenshot of the Layer drop-down menu</p>

<p class="normal">Brilliant – your layer thumbnails are more comprehensive and it is easier to spot which element <a id="_idIndexMarker188"/>is on which layer!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-70">Summary</h1>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we learned about the penciling sketch as part of the manga creation process. This is the best time to make mistakes, keep practicing, and eventually get the proportions right. It may be frustrating if you’re new to drawing figures, as well as being new to drawing on a tablet, but it will get better as you go. In fact, this could be seen as the hardest part of a composition; if you’ve got a good pencil sketch, the rest of the details will fall into place naturally.</p>
<p class="normal">As a significant step in your journey into digital art, we learned what layers are and how to use them when creating your penciling sketch. We can use layers to add sketches in alternate poses or with additional foreground elements. Remember that, when you start inking your artwork on a new layer, you should reduce the pencil sketch layer’s opacity so you can focus on the ink. It’s also helpful to change the color of the penciling layer, to further distinguish it from the ink.</p>
<p class="normal">We also explored the benefits of layers when coloring digital art; they offer freedom for experimentation while protecting each element of your artwork, making your piece easy and safe to edit. With that in mind, we learned about the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette and the various options and icons it has. We also learned about the <strong class="screenText">Layer Property</strong> palette and the different effects it can have on our layers. In <em class="italic">Chapter 15</em> and <em class="italic">Chapter 16</em>, we will explore coloring in much more detail when we look at creating your color palette and exploring layer blending modes.</p>
<p class="normal">As you grow as an artist, your drawings will get increasingly complex. It’s best, after all, to start with simple sketches and work your way upward. To handle the increasing number of layers, we learned how to make layer folders.</p>
<p class="normal">Now, it’s time to get into the pen tools that you will use every day in Clip Studio Paint, whether for penciling or inking. In the next chapter, we will learn about Clip Studio Paint brushes.</p>
