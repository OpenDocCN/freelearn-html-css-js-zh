    testing strategy is indispensable. In fact, not writing enough tests is almost
    always a bad idea. It is essential to cover all nontrivial functionality of your
    code to make sure of the following points:'
  prefs: []

- en: Both these points are very important. Many engineers consider only the first
    point as the sole reason to cover your code with enough tests. The most obvious
    advantage of test coverage is to really make sure that the code being pushed to
    production system is mostly error free. Writing test cases to smartly cover maximum
    functional areas of the code, generally gives good indication around the overall
    quality of the code. There should be no arguments or compromises around this point.
    Although, it is unfortunate that many production systems are still bereft of adequate
    code coverage. It is very important to build an engineering culture where developers
    think about writing tests as much as they think about writing code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The second point is even more important. Legacy systems are usually very difficult
    to manage. When you are working on code, either written by someone else or written
    by a large distributed team, it is fairly easy to introduce bugs and break things.
    Even the best engineers make mistakes. When you are working on a large code base
    you are unfamiliar with, if there is no sound test coverage to help you, you will
    introduce bugs. As you won't have the confidence in the changes you are making,
    because there are no test cases to confirm your changes, your code releases will
    be shaky, slow, and obviously full of hidden bugs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will refrain from refactoring or optimizing your code, because you won't
    be really sure what changes to the code base would potentially break something
    (again, because there are no test case to confirm your changes); all this is a
    vicious circle. It's like a civil engineer saying-although I have constructed
    this bridge, I have no confidence on the quality of the construction. It may collapse
    immediately or never. Although this may sound like an exaggeration, I have seen
    a lot of high impact production code being pushed with no test coverage. This
    is risky and should be avoided. When you are writing enough test cases to cover
    majority of your functional code, when you make change to those pieces, you will
    immediately realize if there is a problem with this new change. If your changes
    make the test case fail, you will realize the problem. If your refactor breaks
    the test scenario, you will realize the problem; all of this happens much before
    the code is pushed to production.

    good test cases in modern JavaScript. We will also look at several tools and methods

    last few years. The concept was first proposed as part of the extreme programming
    methodology. The idea is to have short repetitive development cycles where the
    focus is on writing the test cases first. The cycle looks like the following:'

    test suite should describe the unit-of-code we are testing; this can be a function
    or a group of related functionality. Inside the specs, you will call the global
    Jasmine function,`it`, to which you will pass the title of the spec and the function
    that validates the condition of the testcase This function is the actual test
    case. You can catch one or more assertions or the general expectations using the
    `expect` function. When all expectations are `true`, your spec is passed. You
    can write any valid JavaScript code inside `describe` and `it` functions. The
    values you verify as part of the expectations are matched using a matcher. In
    our example, `toEqual` is the matcher that matches two values for equality. Jasmine
    contains a rich set of matches to suit most of the common use cases. Some common
    matchers supported by Jasmine are as follows:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    system, it is not possible to make sure that all systems are always available
    and correct. At the same time, you don''t want your unit tests to fail due to
    a dependency that may be broken or unavailable. To simulate a situation where
    all dependencies are available for a unit of code we want to test, we will mock
    this dependency to always give the response we expect. Mocking is an important
    aspect of testing, and most testing frameworks provide support for mocking. Jasmine
    allows mocking using a feature called a **Spy**. Jasmine spies essentially stubs
    the functions we may not have ready at the time of writing the test case, but
    as part of the functionality, we will need to track that we are executing those
    dependencies and not ignoring them. Consider the following example:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE9]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: In this example, while we are writing this test case, we either don't have the
    real implementation of the dependency, `configurator.submitPOSTRequest()`, or
    someone is fixing this particular dependency; in any case, we don't have it available.
    For our test to work, we will need to mock it. Jasmine spies allow us to replace
    a function with its mock and allows us to track its execution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this case, we will need to ensure that we called the dependency. When the
    actual dependency is ready, we will revisit this test case to make sure it fits
    the specifications; however, at this time, all we need to ensure that the dependency
    is called. Jasmine function `tohaveBeenCalled()` lets us track the execution of
    a function that may be a mock. We can use `toHaveBeenCalledWith()`, which allows
    us to determine if the stub function was called with correct parameters. There
    are several other interesting scenarios you can create using Jasmine spies. The
    scope of this chapter won't permit us to cover them all, but I would encourage
    you to discover those areas on your own.

    amount of time debugging your or someone else's code. Debugging is almost like
    an art form. Every language has different methods and challenges around the debugging.
    JavaScript is traditionally a difficult language to debug. I have spent days and
    nights in misery, trying to debug badly written JavaScript code using `alert()`
    functions. Fortunately, modern browsers, such as Mozilla, Firefox, and Google
    Chrome, have excellent **Developer Tools** to help debug JavaScript in the browser.
    There are IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA and WebStorm with great debugging support for
    JavaScript and Node.js. In this chapter, we will focus primarily on Google Chrome's
    built-in developer tool. Firefox also supports Firebug extension and has excellent
    built-in developer tools, but as they behave more or less the same as Google Chrome's
    **Developer Tools**, we will discuss common debugging approaches that work in
    both of these tools.

    also helps you convert mistakes into actual errors. There are two ways of enforcing
    strict mode. If you want the strict mode for the entire script, you can just add
    the `use strict` statement (with the quotes) as the first line of your JavaScript
    program. If you want a specific function to confirm to strict mode, you can add
    the directive as the first line of a function. For example, take a look at the

    variable, or try to process a `null`. When a runtime exception occurs, any code
    after that particular line, which caused the exception, does not get executed.
    It is essential to correctly handle such exceptional scenarios in the code. While
    exception handling can help prevent crashes, they also aid in debugging. You can
    wrap the code that may encounter a runtime exception into a `try{ }` block. When
    any code inside this block generates a runtime exception, a corresponding handler
    captures it. The handler is defined by a `catch(exception){}` block. Let''s clarify
    this using the following example:'

    When we wrap this problematic code into `try{}catch(){}` block or when the exception
    occurs (or is thrown), the execution stops in the `try{}` block and goes directly
    to the `catch() {}` handler. The catch handler is responsible for handling the
    exceptional scenario. In this case, we are displaying the error message on the
    console for debugging purposes. You can explicitly throw an exception to trigger
    an unhandled scenario in the code. Consider the following example:'

    exception clearly stating the reason. When we call the function which we think
    may throw an exception, we will wrap the code in the `try{}` block and attach
    a `catch(){}` handler with it. When the exception is caught by the `catch()` block,
    we will handle the exceptional condition appropriately.'
