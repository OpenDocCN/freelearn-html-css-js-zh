    is a sleek, intuitive, and powerful frontend framework for faster and easier web
    development. Opa gives you a very easy way to use Bootstrap in your code. In this
    chapter we will discuss how to use Bootstrap for rapid web development in Opa.

    in the *Resource handler* section of [Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Developing
    Web Applications"), *Developing Web Applications*. We would have to import all
    the necessary Bootstrap files if we do that manually. To make it easy, Opa provides
    some shortcuts for using Bootstrap. Let''s get started with an example:'

    of the above code looks as shown in the following screenshot. We can see that
    the **Click** button is rendered using the `btn` and the `btn-primary` class,
    which are provided by Bootstrap.

    It is just the same as writing code in HTML, that is, `<input class="btn btn-primary"/>`.

    Awesome are scalable vector graphics, which means they look awesome at any size.
    Moreover, you can control icon color, size, shadow, and anything that''s possible
    with CSS. Opa provides the support for Font Awesome in language, so it''s very
    easy for Opa developers to use Font Awesome. Here is an example:'

    You only need to import the proper resources that you want, and the rest is almost
    the same as developing in pure HTML. Bootstrap's home page ([http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap))
    is a good place to get more information.
