  prefs:

- en: A workspace allows you to group many projects and source codes together that
    may have some relation to one another. The workspace also contains a set of preferences,
    such as the configured theme, shortcut settings, and code formatting configuration.
    Be aware of the size of your workspace; it should not be too large, otherwise
    the performance of the system may suffer. How many and how large the projects
    are that your Aptana Studio can handle depends on your system's memory and the
    configured memory settings of Aptana Studio.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you notice that your system's performance is decreasing with the growth of
    your projects, you should maybe divide your workspace into multiple, separate
    workspaces or close some projects that are currently not in use. The method of
    closing a project will be explained later in this chapter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For developers, there are different ways in which workspaces are operated. Some
    work with a single workspace in which they manage all projects. In this case,
    they often have to close unneeded projects or increase their memory in order to
    maintain good performance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Other developers, in turn, work with a lot of different workspaces and further
    use it as an opportunity for grouping.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But why should you group projects into different workspaces?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are many reasons why. Let's say you code in different programming languages.
    For example, you work intermittently on different projects for one or more clients.
    Client group 1 is developing projects based on Zend framework/PHP, and client
    group 2 is developing projects based on OpenLaszlo/Flash. Here we keep all the
    projects in the ZendFramework/PHP category in one workspace and all the other
    projects in the OpenLaszlo/Flash category in another workspace. If you need to
    know how you solved a particular problem in an analogous project, you can find
    that out quickly. As I currently work on a freelance basis, I myself use different
    workspaces that are grouped according to individual clients. This means that I
    often have to change my work environment. For some clients, I help them on site,
    while for other clients I work from my own office.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have worked together with many clients on different projects but those projects
    had completely different methods from one another. Here it is very useful for
    creating a single workspace for each client. If you begin a new section of work
    for a different client, you can simply change the workspace, and everything will
    be available as you left it.

    performance may slow down more and more because the system parser, such as the

    The resources of a closed project are no longer visible in the workspace, but

    because closed projects are not examined during builds.
