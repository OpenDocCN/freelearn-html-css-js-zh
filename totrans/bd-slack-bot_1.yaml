- en: The ultimate goal of this book is for you to think of Slack as a development
    platform with great potential, rather than simply a chat client. As Slack continues
    its meteoric rise in popularity in the developer community, the possibilities
    and opportunities contained in Slack apps will prove to be a valuable tool in
    any developer's toolbox.

    by small teams but has been rapidly morphing into a versatile communications platform
    used by many parties, including the open source community and large businesses.

    In a crowded space of productivity applications, Slack sets itself apart by providing
    extensive integrations with popular third-party apps and provides users with the
    platform to build their own integrations.

- en: As of the beginning of 2016, Slack is used by approximately 2 million users
    daily, and spread across 60,000 teams that send 800 million messages per month
    ([http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/slack-statistics/](http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/slack-statistics/)).
    Some of the more well known companies who use Slack include Airbnb, LinkedIn,
    and The New York Times. This service has become so popular, largely thanks to
    its impressive uptime rate of over 99.9 percent. What sets Slack apart from competition
    such as HipChat or Skype for Business is the determination of the company to open
    its platform for third-party developers in the form of an **application program
    interface** (**API**). To spur the growth of their service as a platform, in December
    2015 Slack pledged to invest $80 million into software projects that use its technology
    ([http://fortune.com/2015/12/15/slack-app-investment-fund/](http://fortune.com/2015/12/15/slack-app-investment-fund/)).
    Added to the more than $320 million raised in funding for the company, it's safe
    to say that Slack will continue to be a driving force in the team productivity
    space in the years to come.

    client, a highly extensible platform exists that can be used to create apps and
    business tools that can simplify the development cycle, perform complex tasks,
    or just be downright silly.

    Slack's platform and leverage their extensive reach and user friendly interface.
    The said third-party applications can send data into Slack via incoming webhooks,
    execute actions outside of Slack with commands, or respond to commands as a bot
    user. The bot user or bot is the most interesting; they are so named as they can
    mimic human users by performing the same actions that any human can.

    (**RTM**) platform. Bots can be used to interact with external applications or
    your custom code in a conversational manner.
