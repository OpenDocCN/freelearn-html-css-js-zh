- en: Three.js is an easy-to-learn 3D graphics library for the web. This book explains
    the Three.js API and how to use it to build immersive online games. By the time
    you finish this book, you'll be able to reach millions of gamers through their
    web browsers, and you'll build exciting projects such as a first-person shooter
    along the way.

- en: I've been building games for more than a decade. When I discovered Three.js,
    the first project I built was very similar to the first-person shooter game you'll
    build in [Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Exploring and Interacting"), *Exploring
    and Interacting*. I was hooked by how quickly I could create fun games with no
    prior exposure to the library.

    spirit. I hope you have as much fun reading it as I had writing it.
