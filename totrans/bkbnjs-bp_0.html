You had to start from scratch and figure it all out on your own. However, now there are plenty of libraries and frameworks that you can use to build amazing web apps that are full of features; Backbone is just one of those libraries.</p><p>Backbone is a client-side library that offers models to manage data records, collections to use when working with sets of models, and views to display that data. Strictly speaking, it's not an MVC library, it's a relatively loose toolbox that you can use in many different ways.</p><p>This book is not an introduction to Backbone. We won't be going through every feature in the library as if it were a friendly version of the documentation. Instead, we'll be looking at Backbone in the context of building an entire web application from start to finish. This means that there are a few features of Backbone—a few obscure methods or properties—that we won't use at all. If you want to learn every nook and cranny of Backbone, you should read the documentation at <a class="ulink" href="http://backbonejs.org/">http://backbonejs.org/</a>.</p><p>This book has two goals. The first is to teach you how to use Backbone to build complete web applications. A complete web application will have a lot more than just JavaScript that runs in the browser. There's HTML and CSS to consider, and of course, every application needs a server. In each chapter of this book, we'll build a different application from scratch, and we'll need to create all these components. Of course, these will be applications with heavy client sides, so most of the code we will write will use Backbone. However, because we're building complete applications, you'll get to see how our Backbone code will work in tandem with the rest of the code.</p><p>The other goal of this book is to teach you how Backbone thinks. As we build an application, we'll use as many different techniques as we possibly can. While there are many Backbone conventions, most of them are not actually necessary for your code to work. By learning what is required, you can fulfill those requirements and write the rest of your code as you see fit, following convention or not.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Building a Simple Blog">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Building a Simple Blog</em></span>, introduces you to each of the main components of Backbone and how they work together. If you haven't used Backbone before, this is important groundwork; if you have, this will be your refresher on the purpose of each Backbone piece.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Building a Photo-sharing Application">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Building a Photo-sharing Application</em></span>, shows you how to build a photo sharing website similar to Instagram. Among other things, you'll learn how to customize the way Backbone models are sent to and received from the server. This is because we'll be using a Backbone model to upload files.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Building a Live Data Dashboard">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Building a Live Data Dashboard</em></span>, takes things to the next level by building an application that continually polls the server for changes to a dataset, effectively creating a <span class="emphasis"><em>live</em></span> application. We'll also look at better code organization.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Building a Calendar">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Building a Calendar</em></span>, will continue the theme of building apps with well-organized code. We'll also learn about properly distributing application functionality.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Building a Chat Application">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Building a Chat Application</em></span>, goes in a different direction by using Socket.IO to control the transfer of data between the client and the server. Also, we'll use the Marionette framework to make our jobs a little easier.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Building a Podcast Application">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Building a Podcast Application</em></span>, shows that not every Backbone application is client-side code, some applications will have a lot of server code. We'll also look at building some custom infrastructure to work with Backbone.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Building a Game">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Building a Game</em></span>, wraps up the book with a fun project. We'll review all the main components of Backbone, as well as building non-Backbone pages to create a more complete web application. Of course, we'll also have to write the game logic.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>Since this book is mostly about client-side code, the main tools are a text editor and a browser. However, there are a few others you'll need. You'll have to install Node.js (<a class="ulink" href="http://nodejs.org">http://nodejs.org</a>), which comes with npm, the Node package manager. If you're on a Mac, that's all you'll need. However, if you are on Windows, you'll also want to have a version of Python 2 (preferably 2.7.3) and Express 2013 for Windows Desktop; you'll need these to install the <code class="literal">bcrypt</code> Node.js package for some of the chapters.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is written for anyone who wants to learn the Backbone library proficiently; by building seven very different applications, you'll quickly learn all the ins and outs of Backbone. Hopefully, you'll also improve your coding skills, for both client and server coding.</p><p>Of course, you'll need to know a few things before we get started. You should have a decent working knowledge of JavaScript. More nuanced language features will be explained in the text, but you should be able to hold your own most of the time. Also, all the server code we write will be in Node.js, so you'll want to be familiar with that. If you understand that Node.js code is often asynchronous and that's why it uses callbacks, you'll be fine. You'll want to be familiar with HTML and CSS; while they will not feature heavily, they will have their parts to play.</p><p>You might wonder if you need to be familiar with Backbone at all to benefit from this book. You'll probably be a little more comfortable with it all if you understand the basics of Backbone, and what the general purposes of its main components are. However, if you've not used it, don't worry. The very first chapter will introduce you to all the parts of Backbone by using them in a simple application.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Conventions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "Next, we can create a file named <code class="literal">app.js</code> in the <code class="literal">public</code> directory."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">var Posts = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Post,
  url: "/posts"
});</pre></div><p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">var User = Backbone.Model.extend({
  url: function () {
    <span class="strong"><strong>return '/user-' + this.get('id') + '.json';</strong></span>
  }
});</pre></div><p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>npm install passport --save</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>New terms</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>important words</strong></span> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: "Type in a name and click on <span class="strong"><strong>Join</strong></span>, and the name will appear above in the list."</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div></div><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip01"/>Tip</h3><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p></div></div></div>
