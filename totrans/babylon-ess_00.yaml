- en: 3D development has always been something mystic. Starting from the beginning,
    this book introduces the required basics of 3D development and the knowledge you
    require to use the Babylon.js framework. It focuses on the simplicity provided
    by Babylon.js and uses a combination of theory and practice. All the chapters
    are provided with example files that are ready to run; each example file provides
    the previously learned features of the framework. Finally, the developers will
    be ready to easily understand the new features that are added to the framework
    in the future and use the more advanced features only using the documentation.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book targets HTML5 developers, who want to build complete 3D video games
    or applications on browsers. The reader should have some familiarity with the
    JavaScript language and basic 3D representations (notion of vectors and dimensions).
    The Babylon.js framework is designed to be easy to use, therefore, no 3D development
    background is needed and beginners are welcome.

- en: Babylon.js Essentials is intended for developers, who want to enter the world
    of 3D development for the Web or add the Babylon.js framework to their skill set.
    The notion of object-oriented programming would be helpful to understand the architecture
    of the Babylon.js framework. Also, familiarity with Web development would be useful
    to understand the principles used.
