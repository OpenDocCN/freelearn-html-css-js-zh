- en: Ryan Dahl created Node.js in 2009\. His goal was to create a system with which
    one can write network server applications having high performance, using JavaScript.
    At that time, JavaScript was mostly run inside browsers, so a server-side framework
    needed some way to run JavaScript without it. Node uses Google's V8 JavaScript
    engine, originally written for the Chrome browser, but since it's a separate piece
    of software, it can run JavaScript code anywhere. Node.js lets you write JavaScript
    code that can be executed on the server. It can make full use of your operating
    system, databases, and other external network resources.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Node is event-driven
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Node.js framework only allows non-blocking, asynchronous I/O. This means
    that any I/O operation that is accessing an external resource, such as the operating
    system, a database, or a network resource must happen asynchronously. This works
    by using events, or callbacks that are fired once the operation succeeds or fails.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The benefit of this is that your application becomes much more scalable, because
    requests don't have to wait around for slow I/O operations to finish and can instead
    handle more incoming requests.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similar frameworks do exist in other languages, such as **Twisted** and **Tornado**
    in Python, and **EventMachine** in Ruby. A big problem with these frameworks is
    that all I/O libraries they use must also be non-blocking. Often, one can end
    up accidentally using code that blocks an I/O operation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Node.js was built from the ground up with an event-driven philosophy and only
    allows non-blocking I/O, thus avoiding this problem.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The V8 JavaScript engine used by Node.js is highly optimized for performance,
    thus making Node.js applications very fast. The fact that Node is non-blocking
    will ensure that your applications will be able to handle many concurrent client
    requests without using a lot of system resources.
  prefs: []

- en: Node is not Rails
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although Node and Rails are often used to build similar types of applications,
    they are in fact, quite different. Rails strives to be a full-stack solution to
    building web applications, whereas Node.js is more of a low-level system for writing
    any type of fast and scalable network application. It does not make a lot of assumptions
    on how your application should be structured at all, except for the fact that
    you'll use an event-based architecture.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    modules that have been built on top of Node for writing web applications, such
    as Express or Flatiron.

    writing Node.js applications with CoffeeScript couldn't be much easier. In fact,
    the `coffee` command that we discussed earlier will run `.coffee` scripts using
    Node by default. To get Node installed with CoffeeScript, see [Chapter 2](ch02.html
    "Chapter 2. Running CoffeeScript"), *Running CoffeeScript*.

    an HTTP server. The `require('http')` function will return an instance of the
    `http` module, which exports a `createServer` function. This function takes a
    `requestListener` argument, which is a function that will respond to client requests.
    In this case, we respond with an HTTP status code `200` and end the response with
    `Hello World` as the request body. Finally, we call the `listen` method on the
    returned server to start it up. When this method is called, the server will listen
    for and handle requests until we stop it.

    web applications basically means writing a raw HTTP server. Luckily, a bunch of
    libraries has been developed over the last few years to help out with writing
    web applications on Node and to abstract away a lot of the low-level details.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The WebSocket protocol is a standard for allowing raw, bi-directional, and full-duplex
    (simultaneous in both directions) TCP connections over the standard HTTP port
    **80**. This allows for a client and server to establish a long-running TCP connection
    with which the server can perform push operations, which has traditionally not
    been possible with HTTP. It is often used in applications where there needs to
    be lots of low-latency interaction between the client and server.

    This means that you'll be able to share your to-do list with other people in real
    time. One or more people will be able to add, complete, or remove to-do list items
    at the same time. Changes to the to-do list will be automatically propagated to
    all users. This is the type of application that Node is perfect for.
  prefs: []

    that will serve static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a WebSocket server that
    handles the real-time updating of all the to-do list clients. Together with this,
    we'll have a jQuery-driven client that will look very similar to our application

    are simple; each module corresponds to a single file. Each module can declare
    code, which will be exported when it is required. When you call `require`, and
    the module's name is not that of a native module or a file path, Node will automatically
    look for the file in the `node_modules` folder. This is of course where npm installs
    modules.
