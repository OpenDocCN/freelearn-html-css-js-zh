["```js\n    Persona 1: Mike, a small business owner\n    Name: Mike Nelson\n    Occupation: Owner of a coffee shop\n    Demographics: 27 years old, lives in San Francisco. Married with two children, 3 and 6\\. Has a generally middle-class income level. Opened the shop 2 years ago after getting married.\n    Mike's Story: Mike was working at a large financial firm, but felt he didn't have enough free time for things important to him, including starting a family. So, he decided to quit his job and use his accumulated savings to open the shop. While some consider it silly, owning a coffee shop had been his dream since his college days (probably owing to how much time he spent in coffee shops during those years!)\n    Mike's Challenges: Mike has poor accounting skills and is having difficulty keeping the company's books. In fact, even relatively simple questions like how much net profit he has every month are difficult for him to determine. He is spending too much time on these difficulties.\n    What Mike Needs: Mike is looking for a product – in the form of a web-based application – that can handle the analysis of his income and expenditures and can automatically supply the information he needs. He would like to see things categorized so he knows, for example, how much he is spending on coffee grounds versus filters.\n    ```", "```js\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Simple Responsive Design Example</title>\n    <style>\n      .container {\n        display: grid;\n        grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);\n        gap: 10px;\n      }\n      @media (max-width: 600px) {\n        .container { grid-template-columns: 1fr; }\n      }\n    </style>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div class=\"container\">\n      <div style=\"background-color:#b0b0b0;\">Column 1</div>\n      <div style=\"background-color:#b0b0b0;\">Column 2</div>\n      <div style=\"background-color:#b0b0b0;\">Column 3</div>\n    </div>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```", "```js\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Progressive Example</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <form action=\"/handleForm\" method=\"post\" id=\"myForm\">\n      Email: <input type=\"text\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\">\n      <button type=\"submit\">Subscribe</button>\n    </form>\n    <div id=\"myDiv\" style=\"color:red;\"></div>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```", "```js\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Progressive Example</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <form action=\"/handleForm\" method=\"post\" id=\"myForm\">\n      Email: <input type=\"text\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\">\n      <button type=\"submit\">Subscribe</button>\n    </form>\n    <div id=\"myDiv\" style=\"color:red;\"></div>\n  </body>\n  <script>\n    document.getElementById(\"myForm\").addEventListener(\"submit\", function(event) {\n      const email = document.getElementById(\"email\").value;\n      if (!email.includes(\"@\")) {\n        document.getElementById(\"myDiv\").innerHTML = \"Email must contain @\";\n        event.preventDefault();\n      }\n    });\n  </script>\n</html>\n```", "```js\nsudo apt install docker.io\n```", "```js\nsudo docker\n```", "```js\nsudo docker run hello-world\n```", "```js\nsudo docker images\n```", "```js\nsudo docker ps\n```", "```js\nsudo docker ps -a\n```", "```js\nsudo docker start <container_id_or_name>\n```", "```js\nsudo docker stop <container_id_or_name>\n```", "```js\ndocker run --name MyAwesomeContainer hello-world\n```", "```js\nsudo docker rm <container_id_or_name>\n```", "```js\nsudo docker rmi <image_id_or_name>\n```", "```js\nsudo docker search hello-world\n```", "```js\nsudo docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name my_nginx nginx\n```", "```js\nsudo docker exec -it my_nginx /bin/bash\n```", "```js\ndocker logs my_nginx\n```", "```js\nimport os\nimport shutil\nimport datetime\ndef make_index(source_path):\n    current_time = datetime.datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\n    head = '<head><link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"></head>'\n    with open(os.path.join(source_path, 'index.html'), 'w') as file:\n        file.write(f\"<html>{head}<body>{current_time}</html>\")\n    print(\"index.html created\")\ndef deploy(source_path, deploy_path):\n    if os.path.exists(deploy_path):\n        print(\"Deleting existing deployment\")\n        shutil.rmtree(deploy_path)\n    shutil.copytree(source_path, deploy_path)\n    print(\"Website deployed\")\n# Execution begins here\nsource_path = \"src\"\ndeploy_path = \"live\"\nmake_index(source_path)\ndeploy(source_path, deploy_path)\n```", "```js\npy build_and_deploy.py\n```"]
