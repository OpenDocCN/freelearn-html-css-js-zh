<em>Now that we have familiarized ourselves with the basic structure and main features of Aptana Studio, let us proceed with the two most important functions, namely the workspaces and projects.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Workspaces and projects allow you to split and group all of your projects and working files into logical and user friendly units, often making work much more effective. Let's start directly and see what workspaces are and what they are good for.</em>
</p><p>Subjects that we'll cover throughout the course of this chapter will include:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What workspaces are and what they are good for</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Creating and deleting workspaces</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to switch between different workspaces</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Importing and exporting Aptana Studio preferences</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Which project natures are available within Aptana Studio</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Creating individual projects</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Common ways of importing projects</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Deleting unnecessary projects</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Changing project natures</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Reasons for closing and opening projects</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Improving performance while working with large projects</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Creating new files within projects</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec37"/>Workspace</h1></div></div></div><p>A workspace allows you to group many projects and source codes together that may have some relation to one another. The workspace also contains a set <a id="id192" class="indexterm"/>of preferences, such as the configured theme, shortcut settings, and code formatting configuration. Be aware of the size of your workspace; it should not be too large, otherwise the performance of the system may suffer. How many and how large the projects are that your Aptana Studio can handle depends on your system's memory and the configured memory settings of Aptana Studio.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip27"/>Tip</h3><p>
<strong>Higher performance</strong>
</p><p>If you notice that your system's performance is decreasing with the growth of your projects, you should maybe divide your workspace into multiple, separate workspaces or close some projects that are currently not in use. The method of closing a project will be explained later in this chapter.</p></div></div><p>For developers, there are different ways in which workspaces are operated. Some work with a single workspace in which they manage all projects. In this case, they often have to close unneeded projects or increase their memory in order to maintain good performance.</p><p>Other developers, in turn, work with a lot of different workspaces and further use it as an opportunity for grouping.</p><p>But why should you group projects into different workspaces?</p><p>There are many reasons why. Let's say you code in different programming languages. For example, you work intermittently on different projects for one or more clients. Client group 1 is developing projects based on Zend framework/PHP, and client group 2 is developing projects based on OpenLaszlo/Flash. Here we keep all the projects in the ZendFramework/PHP category in one workspace and all the other projects in the OpenLaszlo/Flash category in another workspace. If you need to know how you solved a particular problem in an analogous project, you can find that out quickly. As I currently work on a freelance basis, I myself use different workspaces that are grouped according to individual clients. This means that I often have to change my work environment. For some clients, I help them on site, while for other clients I work from my own office.</p><p>We have worked together with many clients on different projects but those projects had completely different methods from one another. Here it is very useful for creating a single workspace for each client. If you begin a new section of work for a different client, you can simply change the workspace, and everything will be available as you left it.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec50"/>Current workspace</h2></div></div></div><p>If you regularly work in different workspaces, you may find yourself asking: which workspace am I in at the moment? or where is the current <a id="id193" class="indexterm"/>workspace located on my local filesystem? How do I locate the current workspace?</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to <strong>File</strong> | <strong>Switch Workspace...</strong> | <strong>Other...</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Here you will find the path to the current active workspace in the <strong>Workspace</strong> field.<div><img src="img/8246_03_01.jpg" alt="Current workspace"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Press <strong>Cancel</strong> to close this window.</li></ol></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec51"/>Creating workspaces</h2></div></div></div><p>Now we want to start working with projects. First, we have to <a id="id194" class="indexterm"/>define a workspace.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec38"/>Time for action – creating a new workspace</h1></div></div></div><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to <strong>File</strong> | <strong>Switch Workspace</strong> | <strong>Other...</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">The window asks us to select a folder where we <a id="id195" class="indexterm"/>want to store our new workspace. So because I'm a supporter of using many small workspaces instead of a single, large one, I first create a folder named <code class="literal">workspaces</code> within my home directory.</li><li class="listitem">The first workspace should contain my own projects, therefore I give them the name <code class="literal">tdeuling</code> and append the date of creation.<div><img src="img/8246_03_02.jpg" alt="Time for action – creating a new workspace"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Within the <a id="id196" class="indexterm"/><strong>Copy Settings</strong> tab, you can select which settings should be copied to the new workspace. <strong>Workspace Layout</strong> will copy <a id="id197" class="indexterm"/>all opened views, their sizes, and selected perspectives to the new workspace. <strong>Working Sets</strong> will copy all user-defined working sets to the new workspace.</li><li class="listitem">By clicking on <strong>OK</strong>, Aptana Studio automatically saves the opened workspace and closes it.

<em>What just happened?</em>
</h2></div></div></div><p>We have just created an additional workspace where you can locate some projects, maybe for a special kind of programming language or for grouping client projects.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec53"/>Importing and exporting preferences</h2></div></div></div><p>On closer observation, we notice that all the settings are lost. This can be pretty annoying, especially if you have made a lot of personalizations and have to create a new workspace. In order to avoid having to set your preferences every time you create a new workspace, Aptana Studio provides the option of importing and <a id="id198" class="indexterm"/>exporting settings.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec39"/>Time for action – exporting Aptana Studio preferences</h1></div></div></div><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to <a id="id199" class="indexterm"/><strong>File</strong> | <strong>Export...</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Select the <strong>Preferences</strong> entry under the <a id="id200" class="indexterm"/><strong>General</strong> entry in the window and click on <strong>Next</strong>.<div><img src="img/8246_03_03.jpg" alt="Time for action – exporting Aptana Studio preferences"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Select the preferences that should be exported.

</h2></div></div></div><p>Now we have saved all the preferences to a local file.

<em>What just happened?</em>
</h2></div></div></div><p>This was quite easy. We just imported back all the settings that we had exported. Let's take a look at Aptana Studio and analyze the behavior and the appearance of the adjusted preferences.</p><p>For example, if you have changed the Aptana Studio theme, your new workspace should be displayed with that theme and all your other preferences should have been restored.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec56"/>Switching between different workspaces</h2></div></div></div><p>Now you surely want to know how to switch between different <a id="id207" class="indexterm"/>workspaces.

</h2></div></div></div><p>You have just switched your workspace, projects, and preferences to another one—just by a single selection. Easy, isn't it?</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec58"/>Deleting unnecessary workspaces</h2></div></div></div><p>Deleting an existing workspace is very simple. You <a id="id210" class="indexterm"/>just have to delete the workspace directory on your filesystem.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note04"/>Note</h3><p>You have to switch into another workspace before you delete a workspace. If you don't do this, Aptana Studio will try to start up by using the deleted workspace and crash on not finding them. The result is that Aptana Studio will not start anymore. If this happens, refer to <a class="link" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. Troubleshooting">Chapter 12</a>, <em>Troubleshooting</em>, in order to fix it.</p></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec42"/>Time for action – deleting a workspace</h1></div></div></div><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Open Aptana Studio and make sure that there are <a id="id211" class="indexterm"/>no projects or files contained in the workspace that you want to delete, which you will need again sometime in the future.</li><li class="listitem">Switch to another workspace, like we have learned earlier in this chapter.</li><li class="listitem">Navigate within your preferred file browser to your workspace and delete the directory.</li></ol></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec59"/>
<em>What just happened?</em>
</h2></div></div></div><p>You have deleted a workspace that is no longer necessary from your system.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip28"/>Tip</h3><p>
<strong>Remove the workspace from the recent workspaces list as well</strong>
</p><p>In order to remove the deleted workspace from the recent workspaces list, which is the list that you will find under <strong>File</strong> | <strong>Workspaces</strong>, navigate to <strong>Window</strong> | <strong>Preferences</strong> and select the <strong>Workspaces</strong> tree item from the <strong>Startup</strong> and <strong>Shutdown</strong> option under the <strong>General</strong> tab. Just select your deleted workspace from the list and click on <strong>Remove</strong>.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec60"/>Workspace preferences</h2></div></div></div><p>Aptana Studio provides a lot of preferences for adjusting the workspace according to your need. You will find all these settings by navigating to <strong>Window</strong> | <strong>Preferences</strong>. In this section, you have to select <strong>General</strong> | <strong>Workspace</strong> within the left tree. Because Aptana Studio provides so many preferences, we are not able to <a id="id212" class="indexterm"/>examine all this. Just take the time and have a closer look at the available preferences. I have mentioned as an example a useful setting that adjusts Aptana Studio so that it will ask you to choose a workspace every time Aptana Studio starts up.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec43"/>Time for action – prompting the selection of a workspace on startup</h1></div></div></div><p>If you are working with a lot of workspaces, it's sometimes a <a id="id213" class="indexterm"/>bit annoying when Aptana Studio starts up with the wrong workspace instead of the one you need.</p><p>So you have to wait until the Aptana Studio startup is finished, after which you can change the workspace, then you must wait until Aptana Studio closes down again. After that, Aptana Studio will start up with the required workspace. This takes a lot of time and is annoying every time.</p><p>But luckily you can teach Aptana Studio to ask you for the required workspace to be loaded before every start up. This is quickly done by performing the following steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to <strong>Window</strong> | <strong>Preferences</strong> and select the <strong>General</strong> | <strong>Startup and</strong> <strong>Shutdown</strong> | <strong>Workspaces</strong> tree item.</li><li class="listitem">Now select the <strong>Refresh workspace on startup</strong> checkbox.</li><li class="listitem">Apply the changes and close the <strong>Preferences</strong> window by clicking on <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec61"/>
<em>What just happened?</em>
</h2></div></div></div><p>We changed the startup preferences, so Aptana Studio asks you which workspace you want to work in/on before every start up. This setting will save you a lot of time if you want/need to switch multiple times between different workspaces.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec62"/>Pop quiz – testing your newly acquired Projects knowledge</h2></div></div></div><p>Q1.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec44"/>Working with projects</h1></div></div></div><p>A project in Aptana Studio is like a group of source <a id="id214" class="indexterm"/>code files that together belong to a web application, website, or something similar.</p><p>But before we start to create our first project, let's take a look at the project nature that Aptana Studio provides.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec63"/>Project nature</h2></div></div></div><p>The project nature allows us to specify the nature of our <a id="id215" class="indexterm"/>project. By assigning a nature to your project, you can enable additional functionalities for it.</p><p>Project nature helps to identify the kind of source code  that is present inside your files. The project nature affects many things, mainly the code assistant.</p><p>It primarily comes down to how the projects are indexed; well, some project types are actually a combination of several others, as you can see in the following table. So, in fact, you can have any file type within your projects, but the project nature defines how different files are evaluated in certain projects. Now, in the following table you will find a file type that is indexed with a particular nature:</p><div><table border="1"><colgroup><col style="text-align: left"/><col style="text-align: left"/><col style="text-align: left"/><col style="text-align: left"/><col style="text-align: left"/><col style="text-align: left"/><col style="text-align: left"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left" valign="bottom">

<strong>Project Explorer</strong> view, you can identify the primary nature of a project on the small icon, which extends the project folder, as <a id="id217" class="indexterm"/>shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/8246_03_09.jpg" alt="Project nature"/></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec64"/>Creating a new project</h2></div></div></div><p>Now we want to create our first project within our <a id="id218" class="indexterm"/>workspace. Aptana Studio provides us with different ways to do this. The fastest way to do this is by using the toolbar. Just click on the small triangle to the left of the new button. It appears as a small menu, where we can directly select the project type for our new project.</p><div><img src="img/8246_03_10.jpg" alt="Creating a new project"/></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip29"/>Tip</h3><p>
<strong>Shortcut</strong>
</p><p>In order to create a new project much faster, you can use the keyboard shortcut <em>Shift</em> + <em>Alt</em> + <em>N</em>. It directly provides a selection menu, similar to the new menu, and you can select the required project type by using the arrow keys.</p></div></div><p>So from the various ways of selecting a project type, we will select <strong>Web Project</strong> for this example.</p><p>An alternative way to open this project creation selection is to navigate to <strong>File</strong> | <strong>New</strong>. But the list of displayed project entries is not a full list of all the <a id="id219" class="indexterm"/>available projects. If you select the <strong>Project...</strong> item, you will receive a window with all the project types.</p><div><img src="img/8246_03_11.jpg" alt="Creating a new project"/></div><p>Now we have the option of jumping to the next step by clicking on <strong>Next &gt;</strong>, where we can select a template for our new project.</p><div><img src="img/8246_03_12.jpg" alt="Creating a new project"/></div><p>After choosing a project template, we will proceed to the next step, where we have to define a project name and choose its location on our disk.</p><p>Ok, here we go. The name of the project should clearly <a id="id220" class="indexterm"/>describe what the project contains. Therefore, my web projects in the <code class="literal">www</code> folder are always named as per the domain name. The location is by default a folder in the current workspace and bears the same name as the project name.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip30"/>Tip</h3><p>
<strong>Custom location</strong>
</p><p>Sometimes it is useful to locate the project file in a location other than the workspace. For example, you may have a local, Apache web server running that always provides the current version of your project in your <code class="literal">www</code> folder. No problem; just change the location to a folder outside your workspace, and your project will still be associated with your workspace.</p></div></div><div><img src="img/8246_03_13.jpg" alt="Creating a new project"/></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip31"/>Tip</h3><p>
<strong>File synchronization</strong>
</p><p>As a default setting, Aptana Studio automatically refreshes or syncs files in your workspace when a modification happens from outside of Aptana Studio. If you want to disable this behavior, just navigate to <strong>Preferences</strong> | <strong>General</strong> | <strong>Workspace</strong> and deselect the <a id="id221" class="indexterm"/>
<strong>Refresh</strong> button on the access checkbox.</p></div></div><p>For another example of how you can create a project, we will <a id="id222" class="indexterm"/>take a look at the <strong>Promote to Project</strong> functionality. This function allows you to take a folder from your filesystem and convert it into a new project.</p></div></div>

You will find the new project within your <strong>Project Explorer</strong> or <strong>App Explorer</strong> view.</p><div><img src="img/8246_03_17.jpg" alt="What just happened?"/></div><p>But what was happening in the background? The source code folder is still located in the same location. Aptana Studio has just added a hidden file named <code class="literal">.project</code> to the root of the source code folder and connected the project with your workspace.</p><p>However, also the import of an existing project is done quickly. So you could for example, have one and the same project integrated in different workspaces.</p></div></div>

</h2></div></div></div><p>After Aptana Studio reopens your currently changed <a id="id245" class="indexterm"/>project, the nature of the project is assumed and the project provides the respective additional functionalities.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec73"/>Closing or opening a project</h2></div></div></div><p>If your workspace is growing with more and more projects, your Aptana Studio performance may slow down more and more because the system parser, such as the error or style checker, gets more and more to do. So it is best <a id="id246" class="indexterm"/>practice to close projects that are currently not necessary.</p><p>When a project is closed within your workspace, it can no longer be changed. The resources of a closed project are no longer visible in the workspace, but they are still on the filesystem. So if a project is closed, it requires less memory in Aptana Studio. You can also improve the build time by closing a project because closed projects are not examined during builds.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip32"/>Tip</h3><p>
<strong>Improve the startup duration</strong>
</p><p>If you close your projects after your work is done and before you close down Aptana Studio, the effect is that the next startup will be much faster when you start up Aptana Studio with opened projects.</p></div></div><p>So let's take a look at how we can close and reopen a project in the <strong>Project Explorer</strong> view. </p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec50"/>Time for action – closing a project</h1></div></div></div><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to the <strong>Project Explorer</strong> <a id="id247" class="indexterm"/>view.</li><li class="listitem">Right-click on the project that you want to close and select <strong>Close project</strong>.</li></ol></div><p>That's it; you have now closed the project, and the icon of the project root node has switched to the icon of a closed folder.</p><p>As an inversed functionality, you can also click on the <strong>Close Unrelated Projects</strong> entry within the project context menu, which closes all projects in your workspace that have no relation to the selected one.</p><p>If you want to reopen a project, you can do so in the same way. Just right-click on the project that you want to reopen and select <strong>Open Project</strong>.</p><p>Improving performance while working with large projects and also working with a large number of projects is often problematic, but if you are working with very large projects, it will be even more problematic. If your projects are too large, your Aptana Studio could become very sluggish.</p><p>Now we will take a look at how we can improve performance by working with large projects.</p><p>The solution to this is to exclude the large project from the index.</p></div>
