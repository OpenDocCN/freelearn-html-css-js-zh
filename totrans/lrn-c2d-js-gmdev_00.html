Not only famous Flash hits and successful native mobile games, but also original games tailored for mobile browsers are played by millions of players everyday.</p><p>With a continuously growing number of mobile devices available to play HTML5 games, and with each one having its own resolution, and display size, and ratio, creating a game version for each device would make you waste a lot of time. That's why there's a new way to make HTML5 games called <strong>cross-platform</strong>. It means you create a game once, and some magic adapts it to every device capable of running HTML5 content.</p><p>This magic is called <strong>Cocos2d-JS</strong>, which allows you to focus on what you actually love, making games, and takes care of screen resolutions and ratios. Also, you will be using one of the simplest and most widely known languages ever: JavaScript. Last but not least, it's free. You can create the next big game at no cost.</p><p>Throughout this book, you will learn how to make games using Cocos2d-JS in the most fun and productive way. We know you hate boring theories, so we did our best to focus the entire book on one single word: action.</p><p>Learn Cocos2d-JS with examples taken from the most successful game genres; see how easy it is to create a game once, and then make it run on each device.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
