<p class="mce-root">WebGL is a powerful web technology that brings hardware-accelerated 3D graphics to the browser without requiring the user to install additional software. Given that WebGL is based on OpenGL and introduces 3D graphics programming to web development, it may seem unfamiliar to even experienced web developers. On the other hand, for those with experience in traditional computer graphics, building 3D applications with JavaScript takes some getting use to. A common view is that JavaScript is not as fast as other traditional languages used in computer graphics; although this is a concern in comparing CPU-bound algorithms, it is not an issue in comparing GPU-bound work. This is where WebGL shines! The powerful capabilities that WebGL offers, coupled with the ubiquity and accessibility of browsers, positions the technology in a unique and attractive position to power the future of immersive experiences on the web.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Packed with many examples, this book shows how WebGL can be easy to learn despite its unfriendly appearance. Each chapter addresses one of the important aspects of 3D graphics programming and presents different alternatives for its implementation. The topics are always associated with exercises that will allow the reader to put the concepts to the test.</p>
<p class="mce-root"><em>Real-Time 3D Graphics with WebGL 2</em> presents a clear roadmap to learning WebGL 2. While WebGL1 is based on the OpenGL ES 2.0 specification, WebGL 2 is derived from OpenGL ES 3.0, which guarantees the availability of many WebGL1 extensions along with new features. Each chapter starts with a summary of the learning goals for the chapter, followed by a detailed description of each topic. The book offers example-rich, up-to-date introductions to a wide range of essential WebGL topics, including drawing, color, texture, transformations, frame buffers, light, surfaces, geometry, and more. Each chapter is packed with useful and practical examples that demonstrate the implementation of these topics in a WebGL scene. With each chapter, you will "level up" your 3D graphics programming skills. This book will become your trustworthy companion, filled with the information required to develop compelling 3D web applications with JavaScript and WebGL 2.</p>

<p><a href="48a27fb2-f17b-43b2-8706-ab638a32b7ff.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Getting Started</em>, introduces the HTML5 <kbd>canvas</kbd> element and describes how to obtain a WebGL 2 context for it. After that, it discusses the basic structure of a WebGL application. The virtual car showroom application is presented as a demo of the capabilities of WebGL. This application also showcases the different components of a WebGL application.</p>
<p><a href="d2019a49-9e84-448c-8799-e296187476d1.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Rendering</em>, presents the WebGL API to define, process, and render objects. This chapter also demonstrates how to perform asynchronous geometry loading using AJAX and JSON.</p>
<p><a href="0dcbfd9d-5446-48e9-90c1-841f4d160232.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Lights</em>, introduces ESSL, the shading language for WebGL. This chapter shows how to implement a lighting strategy for the WebGL scene using ESSL shaders. The theory behind shading and reflective lighting models is covered and put into practice through a variety of examples.</p>
<p><a href="62d4de32-0b5b-4339-8fcc-80f739e80ec2.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Cameras</em>, illustrates the use of matrix algebra to create and operate cameras in WebGL. The Perspective and Normal matrices that are used in a WebGL scene are also described here. The chapter also shows how to pass these matrices to ESSL shaders so that they can be applied to every vertex. The chapter contains several examples that show how to set up a camera in WebGL.</p>
<p><a href="26e073d1-2611-444a-b5d3-f3a73e0f0a49.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Animations</em>, extends the use of matrices to perform geometrical transformations (move, rotate, scale) on scene elements. In this chapter, the concept of matrix stacks is discussed. It is shown how to maintain isolated transformations for every object in the scene using matrix stacks. Also, the chapter describes several animation techniques using matrix stacks and JavaScript timers. A practical demonstration is provided of each technique.</p>
<p><a href="65e942d0-5402-4006-9b64-6811ade8f46c.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Colors, Depth Testing, and Alpha Blending</em>, goes into detail about the use of colors in ESSL shaders. This chapter shows how to define and operate with more than one light source in a WebGL scene. It also explains the concepts of depth testing and alpha blending, and shows how these features can be used to create translucent objects. The chapter contains several practical exercises that put these concepts into practice.</p>
<p><a href="1455f0ba-ecbd-463d-bd1b-6c91fa910b26.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Textures</em>, shows how to create, manage, and map textures in a WebGL scene.

<p><a href="b06d92d3-3687-476f-a181-e7dd3aac1b8f.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Picking</em>, describes a simple implementation of picking, which is the technical term that describes the selection and interaction of the user with objects in the scene. The method described in this chapter calculates mouse-click coordinates and determines whether the user is clicking on any of the objects being rendered in the <kbd>canvas</kbd>. The architecture of the solution is presented with several callback hooks that can be used to implement logic-specific application. A couple of examples of picking are given.</p>
<p><a href="fe7815dc-66ca-4ee5-9d88-9b7d840509a3.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Putting It All Together</em>, ties in the concepts discussed throughout the book. In this chapter, the architecture of the demos is reviewed and the virtual car showroom application outlined in <kbd>Chapter 1</kbd>, <em>Getting Started</em>, is revisited and expanded. Using the virtual car showroom as the case study, this chapter shows how to import Blender models into WebGL scenes and how to create ESSL shaders that support the materials used in Blender.</p>
<p><a href="7100b7e4-1a63-43f4-93ea-f109ca911607.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Advanced Techniques</em>, provides a sample of a number of advanced techniques, including post-processing effects, point sprites, normal mapping, and ray tracing.

                    <h1 class="header-title">Sections</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this book, you will find several headings that appear frequently (Time for Action, What just happened?, and Have a Go).</p>
<p>To give clear instructions on how to complete a procedure or task, we use these sections as follows:</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Time for Action</h1>
                
            
            
                
<ol>
<li>Action 1</li>
<li>Action 2</li>
<li>Action 3</li>
</ol>
<p>Instructions often require some extra explanation to ensure they make sense, so they are followed by these sections:</p>
<p><em><strong>What just happened?</strong></em></p>
<p>This section explains the working of the tasks or instructions that you have just completed.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Have a Go</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>These are practical challenges that give you ideas on how to experiment using what you have learned.</p>
