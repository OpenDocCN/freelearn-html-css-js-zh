<h1 id="_idParaDest-204"><a id="_idTextAnchor204"/>Writing Less Code – CMSs, No-Code Solutions, and Generative AI</h1>
<p>Developers are an inherently lazy bunch. I know that sounds weird but hear me out! We are always looking for ways to write <em class="italic">less</em> code. Sometimes, there is a good reason for that: if someone has already put a ton of time and effort into writing a library that, say, encrypts data, then why should we waste our time re-inventing that particular wheel? We probably shouldn’t in most cases.</p>
<p>Instead, we’re always looking for tools to automate tasks, to generate code for us, or to otherwise save us from ourselves! Of course, I was being facetious earlier when I said we’re lazy. No, it’s more about the efficient use of our time. After all, you can hammer a nail into a piece of wood with a screwdriver if you need to, but it’s far faster and more efficient to use an actual hammer. Just like in carpentry, choosing the right tool for a job is key in web development.</p>
<p>So, after talking about writing code for a few chapters, we’re now going to talk about how to avoid doing just that – or, at least, minimizing it as much as possible and writing code with tools more efficiently! Especially when someone is paying you by the hour, you should always look to optimize your time as much as possible; there are tools for doing just that that you can avail yourself of, and that’s what this chapter is all about, starting with the concept of CMSs, including WordPress and Drupal.</p>
<p>We’ll then move on to so-called “no-code solutions,” platforms that allow you to build websites in a more visual way. Finally, we’ll talk about how the revolution in <strong class="bold">artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">AI</strong>) happening <a id="_idIndexMarker832"/>right now can further enhance your ability to create without coding (at least not as much).</p>
<p>So, in this chapter, we’ll cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introducing WordPress</li>
<li>Getting to know Drupal</li>
<li>Throwing away coding altogether – “no-code” solutions</li>
<li>Utililzing artificial intelligence</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-205"><a id="_idTextAnchor205"/>Introducing WordPress</h1>
<p>The first thing we’re<a id="_idIndexMarker833"/> going to talk about is called a <strong class="bold">content management system</strong> (<strong class="bold">CMS</strong>). A CMS is <a id="_idIndexMarker834"/>software that allows users to create, manage, and change content on a website without needing to have technical knowledge (or at least to minimize it as much as possible).</p>
<p>A typical CMS will allow users to create pages on a website, very often much like creating a document in Microsoft Word or any modern word processor, in a visual way. For example, they will allow you to drag images into place, add text around them, draw sections on the page, and otherwise create a page without writing code. Then, a CMS will normally offer the ability to publish that content, so it is live for visitors, as well as provide management capabilities so that you can delete pages, reorganize them, modify them, and otherwise maintain them. You can create an entire website with a CMS with about the same level of complexity as it takes to create Word documents.</p>
<p>A CMS can even supply more advanced functionality. For example, they can allow you to have a comment section on your pages where visitors can interact with one another socially. They can supply ways to hook into popular social media sites, accept uploads from users, implement polls to get feedback from your users, and many other capabilities.</p>
<p>There are many CMSs out there, but perhaps the most popular is WordPress. <strong class="bold">WordPress</strong> is an open-source CMS known especially for its ease of use, flexibility, and vast community that contributes plugins and themes that allow you to expand its functionality easily. WordPress was originally a blogging platform, but it has evolved to support a wide range of website types nowadays, including e-commerce, portfolios, and business sites. Almost anything you can think of can be done with WordPress because it is especially known for how customizable it is.</p>
<p>In <em class="italic">Figure 8</em><em class="italic">.1</em>, you can see the site that is automatically created as a result of installing WordPress with basic, default options:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 8.1: A default site generated from a basic WordPress installation" src="img/B18315_08_1.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.1: A default site generated from a basic WordPress installation</p>
<p>It’s a great choice for both beginners and advanced developers due to its user-friendly interface and extensive documentation. Many developers will build websites on WordPress, but<a id="_idIndexMarker835"/> non-technical users can use it just as well.</p>
<p>Let’s look at some of the key features of WordPress next.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-206"><a id="_idTextAnchor206"/>Key features</h2>
<p>Some of the most important<a id="_idIndexMarker836"/> features that WordPress offers include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Themes and plugins</strong>: WordPress has thousands of themes and plugins available, allowing users to enhance the functionality and appearance of their websites without all that mucking about in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Themes control the visual presentation, while plugins add features such as contact forms, user polls, message forms, and e-commerce capabilities.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">SEO</strong>: WordPress websites tend to rank well on search engines because they offer SEO-friendly features and plugins such as Yoast SEO to optimize content. The websites it produces are inherently geared toward SEO by design.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">User-friendly</strong>: WordPress has an intuitive dashboard interface that’s easy to navigate, making content management and site administration straightforward. Everything you need can be found in one place and presented in an easy-to-understand way.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Community</strong>: With a large global community, WordPress has extensive forums, tutorials, and resources for troubleshooting and learning. You’ll never be out in the cold trying to figure something out on your own; help is always just a few keystrokes away.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Updates</strong>: The WordPress team frequently updates their code for security and functionality, ensuring the software remains current, stable, and secure.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Reach</strong>: WordPress is widely used by bloggers, small businesses, and even large corporations, demonstrating its versatility and reliability as a website platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>The dashboard interface, which you can see in <em class="italic">Figure 8</em><em class="italic">.2</em>, is the primary way you interact with WordPress. It allows you to control all of its functionality, and it’s worth seeing to understand how comprehensive WordPress really is. Of course, keep in mind that what you see in it <a id="_idIndexMarker837"/>may differ from installation to installation, depending on what plugins you have installed.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 8.2: The WordPress dashboard in all its glory" src="img/B18315_08_2.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.2: The WordPress dashboard in all its glory</p>
<p>It’s also important to note that WordPress is not just one thing, not just a piece of software. It’s divided into two versions that serve different needs and have requirements different from yours as a developer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">WordPress.org </strong>(<a href="http://wordpress.org">wordpress.org</a>): This is where you can find open-source software that’s free to use. To use it, you need to have a server to run it on, and most likely your own domain name will need to be purchased. It offers full customization with access to all plugins and themes, both free and premium. This version is ideal for those who want full control over their website’s functionality and design and who don’t have a problem with administering their own server and managing software on it.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">WordPress.com </strong>(<a href="http://wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a>): This is a commercial offering that offers hosting of websites created with WordPress. With this version, you don’t need your own server and don’t need to install WordPress yourself; it’s all managed for you. You simply purchase a plan and get to building your website immediately, but it otherwise offers all the <a id="_idIndexMarker838"/>same capabilities as self-hosting.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the functional angle, but what about the technology WordPress is built on? Let’s talk briefly about that.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-207"><a id="_idTextAnchor207"/>Understanding the technical perspective</h2>
<p>From a technical<a id="_idIndexMarker839"/> perspective, WordPress is a robust and versatile CMS with the following technical characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">PHP</strong>: WordPress is written in PHP. This handles server-side execution and provides all the functionality WordPress offers, including the ability to update WordPress itself seamlessly on a live site without downtime.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">MySQL</strong>: One of the most popular open-source relational databases out there, MySQL is used by WordPress to store the actual user-generated content, settings, and user data.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Plugins</strong>: The ability to extend functionality without having to update to a whole new version of WordPress is what the plugin architecture enables. Through it, you can add custom features and functionalities modularly, without altering core WordPress code.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Themes</strong>: The presentation layer of WordPress is controlled by themes, which are collections of PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that work together to dictate the visual layout and style of the site.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">The Loop</strong>: This is a fundamental part of WordPress responsible for processing each post and displaying its content, allowing for dynamic content. Things such as showing a new blog post pulled from the database and displayed through a theme is what The Loop is all about. The basic structure of The Loop is as follows:<pre class="source-code">
&lt;?php if (have_posts()) :    while (have_posts()) : the_post();      // Display post content     endwhile;endif;?&gt;</pre><p class="list-inset">The <code>have_posts()</code> function will determine whether there are any posts to be displayed. If there are, the <code>while</code> loop begins. In that loop, for each post, the <code>the_post()</code> function is called to get the data for the post. Then, template files from the theme are used in conjunction with the data for the post. This data is inserted where specific tags in the templates are found, and the result is HTML to be displayed for each post.</p></li> <li><strong class="bold">REST API</strong>: WordPress offers a robust REST API giving developers an interface to use to interact with <a id="_idIndexMarker840"/>a WordPress site remotely by sending and receiving JSON objects, making WordPress a headless CMS option. This means that you can store and manage your content in WordPress but display it through custom code if you wish.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Actions</strong>: These are hooks (bits of code, essentially) that WordPress core executes at specific points during execution, or when specific events occur. Plugins can specify actions to execute at these points, providing a way to enhance WordPress when specific events occur, such as a user leaving a comment, for example.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Filters</strong>: These are bits of code that allow modification of data before it is saved or sent to the browser. This is crucial for customizing the functionality of WordPress without changing the core files. As some examples, filters can be used to automatically do things such as change the formatting of content (perhaps to highlight key phrases), place related posts beneath your content, or truncate text to ensure it always fits on the page in an aesthetically pleasing way.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Security measures</strong>: WordPress has built-in security measures such as regular updates. But being a popular platform for online content, it’s a common target for attacks. Thus, security is often bolstered with plugins, secure hosting, and best practices in website management. For example, some plugins can monitor for hack attempts and alert you, while others can enforce password policies for your users to promote more secure passwords.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Multisite capability</strong>: WordPress allows running multiple sites from a single WordPress installation. This allows for the efficient use of server resources: you don’t need to build a separate server for each WordPress site since one server can handle many sites.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Compatibility and standards</strong>: WordPress always strives to follow web standards set by the W3C, ensuring compatibility with different browsers and devices and ensuring accessibility for those with disabilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>From a developer’s perspective, WordPress offers a balance of user-friendly interface and extensive customizability, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced developers. But its real attraction is <em class="italic">not</em> writing code. Using a <strong class="bold">What You See Is What You Get</strong> (<strong class="bold">WYSIWYG</strong>) interface <a id="_idIndexMarker841"/>allows developers and non-developers alike to drag and drop content quickly and easily. It’s nice to know though that for more advanced use cases, there are ways you <em class="italic">can</em> interact with WordPress in a more traditional developer sense. In any case, as a fledgling web developer, I thought you should have some general idea of <a id="_idIndexMarker842"/>what the technical structure of WordPress was like too.</p>
<p>WordPress isn’t the only popular CMS in town, though. Let’s look at another of its main competitors now, the one known on the streets as Drupal.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-208"><a id="_idTextAnchor208"/>Getting to know Drupal</h1>
<p>Drupal is<a id="_idIndexMarker843"/> another popular open-source CMS, well known for its robustness and flexibility. It is especially well suited to complex, large-scale websites and applications as a result.</p>
<p>You can see the example site that Drupal creates when you install it with basic, default options in <em class="italic">Figure 8</em><em class="italic">.3</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 8.3: A default site created by a basic installation of Drupal" src="img/B18315_08_3.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.3: A default site created by a basic installation of Drupal</p>
<p>Drupal is more of a developer-centric CMS in a sense, given that setting it up and using it requires more technical knowledge than WordPress. WordPress is designed from its core to be user-friendly and is geared toward non-technical users, whereas Drupal isn’t, at least not to the same extent. One of the key reasons is that where WordPress offers a hosted option, Drupal does not. You’ll be setting up your own instance of Drupal on your own server if you want to use it, and that simply requires more technical know-how.</p>
<p>Also, WordPress is WYSIWYG out of the box, whereas Drupal is not. Drupal provides a more limited interface for creating and maintaining content, essentially just a text editor where you can apply some formatting. Creating full-fledged websites with Drupal requires more direct editing of content rather than just dragging and dropping elements around as in WordPress. That said, Drupal can be extended with plugins that can allow it to reach – more or less – parity with WordPress in this regard. Again, Drupal is more geared toward<a id="_idIndexMarker844"/> developers, and while you aren’t writing code per se, it’s closer to that than to WordPress’s visually oriented content creation approach.</p>
<p>In <em class="italic">Figure 8</em><em class="italic">.4</em>, you can begin to get a feel for how more technical Drupal is than WordPress by looking at just the <strong class="bold">Configuration</strong> tab available in the management console, which is just one of many comparatively complex screens with lots of more technically oriented options.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 8.4: The Configuration tab of the Drupal management console" src="img/B18315_08_4.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.4: The Configuration tab of the Drupal management console</p>
<p>Let’s look at <a id="_idIndexMarker845"/>some of the key features of Drupal next.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-209"><a id="_idTextAnchor209"/>Key features</h2>
<p>Some key points about <a id="_idIndexMarker846"/>Drupal to consider include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">PHP</strong>: Like WordPress, Drupal is written in PHP, making it flexible and extensible.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Database integration</strong>: While WordPress only works with MySQL, Drupal supports multiple databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MariaDB, for storing content and settings. It does this by way of a database abstraction layer, which means an API that the Drupal code is written against, which then translates the Drupal function calls to database-specific calls.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Modularity and extensibility</strong>: Instead of plugins, Drupal uses modules to extend its functionality. Different name, but same basic idea. There are thousands of community-contributed modules available for various features, including all the same sorts of things WordPress offers.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Themes</strong>: Similar to WordPress, Drupal uses themes to define the look and feel of a website. Themes in Drupal are highly customizable via HTML, CSS, and JavaScript coding.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Content structure</strong>: Known for its powerful content structuring capabilities, Drupal allows the<a id="_idIndexMarker847"/> creation of multiple content types with custom attributes and fields. It’s more than just web pages in Drupal land; it’s whatever type of content you need, be it videos, images, PDF files, Excel spreadsheets, and so on.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Access control</strong>: Drupal provides an advanced user role and permission system, enabling granular access control for different types of users. Because Drupal is known for its strong security features, it is often chosen for government and enterprise websites. It also offers in-depth security reports and regular updates.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Performance and scalability</strong>: Drupal is designed from the ground up for performance and scalability, handling large amounts of data and traffic efficiently. It has built-in caching features and can be integrated with external caching systems for high-traffic websites.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Community and ecosystem</strong>: Drupal has an active community of developers, designers, and content managers, providing extensive support through forums, documentation, and events.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">API-first approach</strong>: Drupal supports a <em class="italic">headless</em> or <em class="italic">decoupled</em> architecture, meaning that the frontend (what a user sees) is separated from the backend (where content is stored), allowing for more flexibility in content delivery.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Multilingual capabilities</strong>: Drupal offers extensive multilingual features out of the box, allowing for easy content translation and site localization.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Version updates</strong>: Unlike WordPress, which can be updated seamlessly, Drupal’s version updates are significant, often requiring considerable effort to migrate from one major version to another.</li>
</ul>
<p>Drupal is particularly suited for complex, data-driven websites and those requiring extensive content organization, such as community platforms, online stores, and corporate websites. Its steep learning curve can be challenging for beginners but offers powerful solutions for experienced developers.</p>
<p>Given that more <a id="_idIndexMarker848"/>developer-centric focus, you might imagine there is more to say about Drupal from a technical perspective, and you’re right, and that’s what we’re discussing next.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-210"><a id="_idTextAnchor210"/>Understanding the technical perspective</h2>
<p>From a technical <a id="_idIndexMarker849"/>perspective, Drupal stands out for its robust architecture, advanced customization capabilities, and strong focus on scalability and security. Here are some key technical points:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Modularity</strong>: Drupal’s architecture is highly modular, allowing for extensive customization. Core functionalities can be extended or overridden with custom modules.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Hook system</strong>: Drupal employs a hook system that allows modules to interact with the core and alter or extend its behavior without modifying the core files.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Performance</strong>: As mentioned before, Drupal has extensive caching mechanisms (such as Page Cache and Block Cache) to improve performance. It also supports robust integration with external caching systems such as Varnish and Memcached to further improve performance.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Theming</strong>: Drupal uses the Twig templating engine, which is a flexible, secure, and fast templating engine, for implementing its themes. Drupal themes are inherently responsive, ensuring websites work well on various devices.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">API-first approach</strong>: Drupal supports RESTful APIs, allowing for headless or decoupled architectures where the frontend is separated from the backend. In fact, it does this internally, meaning that Drupal itself is conceptually separated like this.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Security</strong>: Drupal offers a sophisticated <strong class="bold">Role-Based Access Control</strong> (<strong class="bold">RBAC</strong>) system, allowing <a id="_idIndexMarker850"/>detailed permissions and user management, generally considered to be more robust and better suited to the needs of large businesses.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Quality assurance</strong>: Drupal includes a comprehensive testing framework, supporting unit, functional, and integration testing, and it enforces strict coding standards, contributing<a id="_idIndexMarker851"/> to the overall quality and maintainability of the code.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Taxonomy system</strong>: Drupal has a highly sophisticated taxonomy system, enabling intricate categorization and tagging of content.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Localization support</strong>: Drupal has strong multilingual and localization capabilities built into the core, making it suitable for international and multi-language sites.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Configuration management</strong>: Drupal has a sophisticated configuration management system. It allows developers to easily manage and transfer configuration changes from development to production environments, a critical feature for complex and large-scale website development. It is, in a sense, built-in DevOps!</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Views module</strong>: One of Drupal’s most powerful features, the Views module allows users to create, manage, and display lists of content. Unlike WordPress, where similar functionality is achieved through plugins, Views is integrated into Drupal core in its recent versions.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Block system</strong>: Drupal’s block system is another key feature. It allows for the placement of content and other elements in region-specific blocks on a page, offering extensive layout customization.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">APIs</strong>: Drupal functions not only as a CMS but also as a framework, allowing developers to build custom applications on top of it. It offers a range of APIs for different functionalities, such as database management, theming, and user management.</li>
</ul>
<p>To summarize, Drupal is, in a sense, a developer’s CMS. Meanwhile, WordPress can still require some<a id="_idIndexMarker852"/> technical knowledge, yet is much more focused on end users.</p>
<p>But recently, a new kid on the block has arrived that takes the vision of WordPress to a whole new level, and that’s the land of no-code solutions, which is the next stop on our train ride to web developer expertise!</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-211"><a id="_idTextAnchor211"/>Throwing away coding altogether – “no-code” solutions</h1>
<p>While a CMS such as <a id="_idIndexMarker853"/>WordPress – and Drupal, to a lesser extent – can be user-friendly and can be used by non-technical users in the case of WordPress, there is a whole other class of tools that takes this a giant step further into the realm of no-code solutions. WordPress really does come pretty close, and some would probably even argue that it <em class="italic">is literally</em> a no-code solution, especially the WordPress.com side of it.</p>
<p>But true no-code solutions really step this paradigm up and become something that <em class="italic">anyone</em> can use with virtually zero technical knowledge.</p>
<p><strong class="bold">No-code solutions</strong> are tools that allow users to build and manage applications and websites without the need for programming skills. These solutions are designed to be user-friendly, often using drag-and-drop interfaces and pre-built templates, and generally present a visual development environment to the non-technical user.</p>
<p>These solutions democratize web app and website development, enabling business professionals, entrepreneurs, and hobbyists to create digital content. And, while you definitely can create robust web apps with them, it’s more common to find more static websites being built with them. This is largely down to the visual development paradigm they typically employ: it’s far easier to represent static content in a visual builder tool than it is dynamic interactions (though not impossible, to be clear).</p>
<p>No-code solutions are particularly popular among small businesses, start-ups, and non-technical users in larger organizations. They can be used to build websites, mobile apps, and internal business applications and even to automate business workflows.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that no-code solutions are not usually something you install yourself and they aren’t pieces of software per se. Almost always, they are themselves websites that you go to that provide all the functionality you need in one place. You don’t need to worry about servers, domain names, or, of course, programming or anything else because these solutions are all-encompassing, including hosting. You’ll build your website there, and <a id="_idIndexMarker854"/>it will be immediately available on the internet at the click of a button.</p>
<p>The key aspects of these no-code solutions include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">User interface (UI)</strong>: No-code<a id="_idIndexMarker855"/> solutions usually feature a GUI that allows users to build apps and websites by visually manipulating elements. This can include dragging and dropping components such as text boxes, buttons, and images onto a canvas.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Customization</strong>: Although no-code solutions offer less customization than hand-coding does, many of these solutions provide a range of templates and modules that can be tailored to meet specific needs. Users can often customize the look and feel of their results, again in a visually driven way that doesn’t require coding.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Integration</strong>: Many no-code solutions offer integrations with other software and services at the click of a button. This allows users to connect their no-code solutions with existing tools and systems, such as databases, CRM systems, or email servers.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Data handling and analytics</strong>: Many no-code solutions offer built-in tools for data management, analytics, and reporting. Users can create forms, manage databases, and visualize data without coding. This feature is particularly useful for businesses that need to gather insights about how their website is being accessed, or for dealing with data generally, but who lack the technical expertise for complex data handling.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Collaboration</strong>: No-code solutions often emphasize collaboration, allowing multiple users to work on a project simultaneously. This can include version control, role-based access, and real-time editing, but with a more user-friendly model than even something such as GitHub provides.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Responsive design</strong>: Most no-code solutions automatically ensure that the generated results are responsive, meaning they will adapt to different screen sizes, from desktops to smartphones. This is crucial in today’s multi-device environment.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Marketplaces</strong>: Some no-code solutions offer marketplaces where users can find additional plugins or extensions, created either by the solution provider or third-party developers. These add-ons can extend the functionality of the base platform.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Community and support</strong>: The rise of no-code solutions has had the result of creating vibrant user communities where people share tips, templates, and best practices. Most <a id="_idIndexMarker856"/>solutions also offer robust customer support and educational resources to help users maximize the solution’s potential.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Cross-platform</strong>: No-code solutions can be used from any device, regardless of hardware specifications, OS, or other considerations. This makes them more accessible to more people.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Security and compliance</strong>: Any good no-code solution will be designed with security in mind and adhere to industry-standard compliance regulations. It’ll ultimately be up to the users of these solutions how to implement it, but the tools for solid security should be provided.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Economic impact</strong>: By enabling more people to build websites and web apps, no-code solutions are lowering the barrier to entry in the tech world, potentially leading to more innovation and economic growth, especially in sectors where technology adoption was previously limited.</li>
</ul>
<p>To begin to get a feel for what such a solution looks like, take a look at <em class="italic">Figure 8</em><em class="italic">.5</em>. This is the designer interface for GoDaddy, which is a popular no-code solution. In it, you can see how just clicking an element provides an editor on the right where you can easily change all sorts of<a id="_idIndexMarker857"/> parameters (this is for a site generated for me from a starting template for an online candle store).</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 8.5: The GoDaddy designer interface in action (as much “action” as there can be on a printed page anyway!)" src="img/B18315_08_5.jpg"/>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.5: The GoDaddy designer interface in action (as much “action” as there can be on a printed page anyway!)</p>
<p>The primary advantage of no-code solutions is speed and efficiency. Since there is no custom programming needed, they tend to be faster to create. This also makes them more cost-effective since no (often times expensive) web developers are needed. This all has the result of empowering non-developers, allowing those without coding skills to take part in the development process.</p>
<p>In the case of GoDaddy’s web designer, for example, it allows an exclusively visual-based approach to designing, a paradigm where the user drags and drops components around the page and can edit details about each as necessary, all without coding.</p>
<p>Of course, it isn’t all roses and rainbows when it comes to no-code solutions. For one thing, as an organization’s needs grow and evolve, the limitations of no-code solutions may become apparent because they may not supply the flexibility you need at some point. While they are excellent for the quick deployment and validation of ideas, transitioning to more customizable, code-based solutions might be necessary for scaling and complex customization. That said, most good no-code solutions will grow with you for a while and provide fertile ground to start your online journey.</p>
<p>For another thing, no-code solutions make you dependent on the provider of that solution. While this isn’t the case when you host your own hardware, no-code solutions do tend to bind you to them more deeply, and it can be difficult to move away from them if and when needed. This won’t be a problem for many people, of course, but it’s something to be aware of as at least a potential issue.</p>
<p>No-code solutions<a id="_idIndexMarker858"/> represent a significant shift in the technology landscape, making app and web development more accessible and altering traditional dynamics in the tech industry by allowing non-coders to produce results that until now have required custom development.</p>
<p>Let’s now talk about some of the biggest names in the no-code movement.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-212"><a id="_idTextAnchor212"/>Introducing some popular no-code solutions</h2>
<p>In the realm of web<a id="_idIndexMarker859"/> development, several popular no-code solutions have gained widespread recognition for their ease of use and powerful features. Here are some notable examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Wix</strong>: Wix is very similar to GoDaddy in approach, again providing a visual design toolset that doesn’t require any coding. It arguably tends to be slightly less user-friendly than GoDaddy, but the difference isn’t drastic if so.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Squarespace</strong>: Squarespace is favored for its sleek, professionally designed templates, making it ideal for portfolios, blogs, and business websites. It offers robust design options and e-commerce capabilities.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Weebly</strong>: A user-friendly solution with drag-and-drop tools, Weebly is great for small businesses and online stores. It integrates e-commerce features and provides various design templates.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Shopify</strong>: Primarily focused on e-commerce, Shopify allows users to create online stores without coding. It offers extensive e-commerce tools, templates, and integration with a wide range of payment gateways and other services.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Carrd</strong>: Specializing in one-page websites, Carrd is a simple, lightweight tool for creating personal profiles, landing pages, and simple portfolios.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Bubble</strong>: While it’s more focused on web applications than websites, Bubble is a powerful no-code tool that allows for the development of complex, data-driven web applications with a visual programming interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>These solutions stand out for their ease of use, diverse design options, and ability to cater to various needs.</p>
<p>But what if even <a id="_idIndexMarker860"/>drag-and-drop and a visual builder are too much for someone? Well, there’s something that has crashed onto the scene like little else that may give an answer, and that’s AI.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-213"><a id="_idTextAnchor213"/>Utilizing artificial intelligence</h1>
<p>AI isn’t new. It’s been<a id="_idIndexMarker861"/> around since around 1956 in various forms, but 2023 was a watershed moment for it in which we saw a sudden explosion of innovation in space.</p>
<p>Many of the no-code solutions out there are now adding AI capabilities to the mix. GoDaddy and Wix both<a id="_idIndexMarker862"/> incorporate <strong class="bold">artificial design intelligence</strong>, or <strong class="bold">ADI</strong>. This is a form of AI that simplifies the design process by automatically creating a website based on the user’s responses to a set of questions. This approach is particularly beneficial for those who want a professional-looking website without investing much time or needing technical skills. You simply answer a series of questions, such as what your website is about, where it’s located, and any key points about it, and these platforms can create a website from those responses that, while not a complete and ready-to-go result, serves as a good starting point for your design work.</p>
<p>Of course, such a thing isn’t without its limitations. Reliance on ADI means that websites may lack uniqueness since AI isn’t yet <em class="italic">quite</em> as creative as humans can be, and users might find the designs somewhat limited compared to competitors since there have to be guardrails in place for any AI, limits to what it can produce. While being able to produce a website with a simple description is incredibly powerful (and I would even say cool!), it doesn’t offer as much creative freedom and lacks certain advanced features, such as the ability to integrate third-party apps as effectively.</p>
<p>This AI-driven no-code solution is best suited for businesses or individuals who need a simple, clean, and professional website quickly and are not looking to delve deeply into customizations or advanced features. It’s particularly user-friendly and affordable, with various pricing plans, including a free option, making it a practical choice for small businesses or entrepreneurs starting out.</p>
<p>But this is just<a id="_idIndexMarker863"/> one specific example of a more generic concept, a concept that has really taken the world by storm and that you as a web developer can use in other ways, and that concept is called generative AI. Let’s delve into that a little deeper.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-214"><a id="_idTextAnchor214"/>Generative AI</h2>
<p>You would have to<a id="_idIndexMarker864"/> have been living under a rock for most of 2023 to have not heard of generative AI. AI itself isn’t new, of course, it’s been around since around 1956 in various forms, but 2023 was a watershed moment for it when ChatGPT, the poster child for generative AI, hit the scene.</p>
<p><strong class="bold">Generative AI</strong> is a type of AI that can create new content, be it text, images, programming code, music, or even whole websites. It does this by first ingesting a large amount of data and, in a sense, learning from it. This data can be many things, including books, existing music, source code from GitHub, and documents of various types. The AI can understand the patterns and structure of this data and then use it to generate new (arguably) original output. For example, generative AI such as ChatGPT can write a news article, compose a piece of music, or create an image that never existed before. As you can probably tell, generative AI has the potential to revolutionize the way websites – and a lot of other things – are built, offering new levels of efficiency, customization, and creativity.</p>
<p>In terms of how AI like this works, and without getting into all the complex math and concepts that underly them, the main component is what results from ingesting all of the data I mentioned: something called a <strong class="bold">model</strong>. It’s a complex representation of all of the data in the form of a <strong class="bold">neural network</strong>. A neural network is essentially an algorithm specifically built to be able to recognize patterns, which is similar to how the human brain works. When you ask ChatGPT a question, it uses complex statistics to traverse this model, finding patterns that match what it statistically believes follows logically from each step in the traversal. In the end, they output something that the model statistically sees as being most likely to answer the request that was put to it.</p>
<p>There are many different<a id="_idIndexMarker865"/> models, trained from many different datasets. GPT, which underlies ChatGPT (which is really a combination of a UI plus that model), is specifically for textual content. Another model, DALL-E, was trained on a large set of images and can produce new ones from it. The more data a model is trained on – assuming the data is of sufficient quality – the more productive and accurate it becomes at fulfilling requests to it.</p>
<p>In <em class="italic">Figure 8</em><em class="italic">.6</em>, you can see what the ChatGPT (<a href="https://chat.openai.com">https://chat.openai.com</a>) interface looks like, where I’ve had a bit of a discussion about programming to give you an idea of what such an interaction can be like.</p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.6: A conversation with ChatGPT, the preeminent generative AI solution today</p>
<p>On the left, you can see a history of chats I’ve had with ChatGPT (don’t mind some of the sillier conversations; this thing can be fun as well as useful!). On the right is the current conversation where you can see it was able to generate some example code to answer my question. The chat goes on for a while with me asking clarifying questions and for an example using a specific library. This exchange was quite helpful to a project I was working on.</p>
<p>But ChatGPT and other generative AI models like it can do even more than this. Various models can be used for specific purposes, and these tools can be integrated into other products, expanding<a id="_idIndexMarker866"/> their capability. Here’s a list of some interesting uses you can find being used in the world today when it comes to web development:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Prototyping and wireframing</strong>: Generative AI tools can quickly generate website prototypes and wireframes, allowing designers to visualize and refine their ideas more rapidly than they probably could otherwise.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Automated design creation</strong>: Generative AI can generate website layouts and designs based on user preferences or predefined criteria – or even prototypes and wireframes it previously generated! Some of the big no-code solutions are beginning to integrate these kinds of capabilities to incredible effect.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Copy generation</strong>: Generative AI can be used to create textual content for websites. For instance, it can generate product descriptions, blog posts, or marketing copy tailored to the site’s audience, saving time and effort on the part of humans (which, generically, is what most of this boils down to frankly).</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Visual asset creation</strong>: Generative AI can generate visual assets such as images, icons, or even animations that are tailored to the website’s theme and requirements.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Code generation</strong>: Generative AI can generate the actual code needed to build websites, especially for standard components. This can significantly speed up the development process, although it may require oversight and refinement from human developers, which is a common theme with any generative AI model. I’ll go into this a bit more in the next section.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">SEO optimization</strong>: AI can analyze search engine algorithms and suggest or implement SEO strategies for better ranking, including keyword optimization, meta tags, and content structuring. For example, it can analyze the top results from a search you want your site to be ranked higher in, and then see what changes could be made to your site to achieve that goal.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Personalization</strong>: AI can personalize website experiences for individual visitors in real time. It can change layouts, content, and recommendations based on user behavior, preferences, and interactions. This is different than the previous points in that here we’re not talking about using AI to build a website; instead, we’re talking about AI that runs on behalf of the user, as they’re actually using a website.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">UI and UX optimization</strong>: As with personalization, AI can analyze user interaction data after a website is live to suggest improvements in the UI/UX design. This could come in the form of training a model on data collected from users using your site, from which you can then extract suggestions from the model about things to improve.</li>
</ul>
<p>The integration of<a id="_idIndexMarker867"/> generative AI and other forms of advanced AI systems into web development tools and solutions is still something that is evolving. We’re still figuring out how to use these new techniques and tools. As AI technology advances though, it seems likely that it will become an integral part of the web development process, offering more sophisticated and intuitive ways to build websites. I don’t personally believe it will replace web developers, but web developers will certainly have to understand and adapt to these tools, integrating them into their toolbox. It seems likely to me that those who don’t will probably be left behind, so if for no other reason than the selfish “I want to be employable” perspective, it’s important to be aware of AI advancements and keep up with how they can be used to make you a more effective web developer.</p>
<p>One last area of this topic I want to discuss is how you can use generative AI tools to write code, with one way in particular at the forefront: GitHub Copilot.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-215"><a id="_idTextAnchor215"/>GitHub Copilot</h2>
<p>While the idea<a id="_idIndexMarker868"/> of generative AI being used to generate whole websites or content for sites, or being used as tools to help build and enhance websites, was the thrust of the previous section, here I want to talk about the idea of using it to write code: in other words, continuing to be web developers, but using tools to make that job easier and more efficient. While ChatGPT can be used in that way because it’s quite good at being able to generate code for you, or helping you troubleshoot your code, these capabilities are taken to another level when you use a good IDE with Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot integrated into it.</p>
<p><strong class="bold">Copilot</strong> is actually powered by the GPT model, the same one (or, at least, one of several available) that ChatGPT uses. But the training data that the model is based on is all the content on GitHub (well, any content that hasn’t been explicitly disallowed for this purpose at least).</p>
<p>It allows for two<a id="_idIndexMarker869"/> key capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to have the code you write be autocompleted</li>
<li>The ability to generate code from comments</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find information on how to install Copilot on your specific IDE (it supports most of them) here: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot">https://docs.github.com/en/copilot</a>. Then, as you type your code, Copilot can suggest completions.</p>
<p>And let me tell you, it can get scary good at it sometimes! Since it is aware of the code in your project, as well as all the repositories hosted on GitHub, it’s able to offer suggestions that make sense within the code you’re writing – contextually meaningful suggestions, not just random gibberish pulled from other people’s code.</p>
<p><em class="italic">Figure 8</em><em class="italic">.7</em> demonstrates Copilot’s autocomplete capabilities in IntelliJ IDEA. Here, you can see that it has suggested for me a line of code that builds upon what I already wrote. It’s a little hard to see on the printed page due to the coloring that is present on the screen but not in print, but all of the code after the highlighted <code>return</code> statement was suggested by Copilot. All I need to do at this point is hit the <em class="italic">Tab</em> key to accept the suggestion, and the code is inserted into my editor.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 8.7: An example of using Copilot’s comments-to-code capability" src="img/B18315_08_7.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.7: An example of using Copilot’s comments-to-code capability</p>
<p>Microsoft calls Copilot “your AI pair programmer.” Pair programming is an idea where two developers sit<a id="_idIndexMarker870"/> down physically together and code together. One person may control the keyboard, or it may pass between them, and you write code in a pair, both of your brains working together, hopefully harmoniously! If you’ve ever seen the movie <em class="italic">Pacific Rim</em>, it’s a lot like the Drift that allows two pilots to control the Jaegers, the giant robots used to fight the Kaiju (the giant monsters), sharing the mental strain. With Copilot, your partner is in a sense all the developers who have code posted on GitHub!</p>
<p>Aside from those autocompletion suggestions, Copilot has another trick up its sleeve. If you type up some comments, in plain language, describing a function, Copilot can then produce that function for you! It’s really kind of amazing when you see it in action.</p>
<p><em class="italic">Figure 8</em><em class="italic">.8</em> shows the usage of Copilot in IntelliJ IDEA. Here, you can see that it has suggested for me an implementation of a function to search through objects in an array, based on my comments. All I did was type the comments, hit <em class="italic">Enter</em>, and then wait a moment for Copilot to generate the code you see. All I need to do now is hit the <em class="italic">Tab</em> key to accept the suggestion, and the code is inserted into my editor.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 8.8: An example of using Copilot’s comments-to-code capability" src="img/B18315_08_8.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.8: An example of using Copilot’s comments-to-code capability</p>
<p>As of the time of writing, a third capability – chat – is becoming generally available. This puts a mechanism just like ChatGPT into Copilot. Now, you can have a back-and-forth discussion with <a id="_idIndexMarker871"/>Copilot about some tricky programming issue you’re having, or ask for documentation about something, to generate code or test cases, and to help you with debugging. While ChatGPT can do all of this too, having it integrated into your IDE and having it be immediately aware of what you’re working on already is game-changing. Unlike ChatGPT though, chat in Copilot can only answer questions about coding; it by design isn’t as general-purpose as ChatGPT is.</p>
<p>And here’s the good news: you can play with Copilot for free! Microsoft offers a fairly generous free trial period, after which Copilot costs a nominal fee (as of the time of writing, $10 a month for an individual). I for one find it to be very much worth the expense.</p>
<p>Now, that all may sound great, but here’s the one big warning with Copilot, and for any generative AI actually: <em class="italic">you can’t blindly trust them</em>! Generative AI models are known to <em class="italic">hallucinate</em>, which is to say they make things up that are basically gibberish. Of course, we are in fact asking the AI to make things up, but we expect those things to be valid, and they aren’t always. In the same vein, the answers these models produce are sometimes factually incorrect. They simply get things wrong sometimes. Often, it’s because the training data was flawed, and sometimes it’s because the complex math that underpins them simply leads to incorrect answers.</p>
<p>Check out <em class="italic">Figure 8</em><em class="italic">.9</em> for an example of this. While trying to figure out a problem at work, I asked a question about dates in JavaScript, and the answer it gave wasn’t correct. Though I pointed this out to the AI and it corrected itself, if I didn’t have some foundational knowledge already, I probably wouldn’t have spotted that, and I might have been sent off down the wrong path, wasting time and energy. So, you must keep an eye on these things<a id="_idIndexMarker872"/> and not just rely on them 100%, which is the point I’m making here.</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 8.9: ChatGPT making a mistake" src="img/B18315_08_9.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.9: ChatGPT making a mistake</p>
<p>So, you can’t take their answers as absolute truth; you have to think and validate it yourself. This means that generative AI requires you to already have some knowledge of the topic you’re discussing with it, which means something such as Copilot – which is specifically geared to writing code – wouldn’t be as helpful to someone who doesn’t already know how to code. If you see something that you think isn’t right, the interesting thing is you can challenge the AI, at which point it will often correct itself, as you see in <em class="italic">Figure 8</em><em class="italic">.9</em>.</p>
<p>Right or wrong, the ability to have an ongoing conversation with these things is when you can start to see the most benefit, though. You can ask a question, get an answer, then ask to expand on that answer. You may see something in the answer that you’ve never heard of before and be able to prove further. As a personal anecdote, this happened to me once when I was asking about how to do something in Java. I can’t frankly remember the problem I was trying to solve, but the point is that ChatGPT (which I was using before I started using Copilot) offered a solution – which worked fine – but used some language feature I hadn’t seen before. I was able to ask a follow-up question about that feature, and I got a great explanation. I was then able to ask another follow-up asking for an example and got it. All of this led to me understanding that feature, I believe, better than I probably would have if I had just Googled it and read some articles.</p>
<p>You shouldn’t<a id="_idIndexMarker873"/> undersell the ability to – without shame – ask question after question after question, even if you think some of them are “stupid.” Especially in the early days of your web developer journey, you’re going to have a lot of questions that may be hard to get answers for with a search engine such as Google, and that you might be embarrassed to ask a person about, if you even have someone you can ask. Well, first, you really shouldn’t be embarrassed because we all start at a point of not knowing everything, and asking questions is how you learn! But I get it: we’re people and sometimes we feel like we’re asking silly questions.</p>
<p>Well, ChatGPT or Copilot is never going to judge you! You can keep asking it as many questions as you need to, keep asking it for different examples or different explanations, and it’ll keep trying as long as you need it to. You can build your knowledge over time with it, keep going off on tangents as much as you need, and it’ll never get tired or annoyed with you. It’s a capability we haven’t as a society had before, and it really can be transformational.</p>
<p>So, I strongly encourage you to start using these generative AI tools, be it ChatGPT or Copilot, or whatever else is out there or comes out after these words have been committed to paper. As I said, don’t trust them 100% because they <em class="italic">do</em> get things wrong, but in my experience, they do more than a good enough job for the benefits to far outweigh any negatives.</p>
<p>While some worry that this new breed of AI tools and no-code solutions may take our jobs in the long run, I for one think the opposite will happen: these tools will become necessary tools that web developers will have to come to terms with and learn how to use effectively.</p>
<p>And hey, if they ultimately turn into Skynet and send Terminators after all of us, at least we will have built<a id="_idIndexMarker874"/> some great websites in the meantime, right?</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-216"><a id="_idTextAnchor216"/>Reviewing the roadmap</h1>
<p>As we wrap up the technical-focused part of this book, you’ve uncovered a few more items. In <em class="italic">Figure 8</em><em class="italic">.10</em>, you can see the updated web developer roadmap:</p>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 8.10: The roadmap, with a few more boxes filled in</p>
<p>With this chapter, you uncovered <strong class="bold">CRMs</strong> (which completes the <strong class="bold">Frontend</strong> section of the roadmap!), <strong class="bold">No-Code Solutions</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Generative AI</strong>. That may not seem like a lot, but hey, they’re pretty cool topics, wouldn’t you say?</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-217"><a id="_idTextAnchor217"/>Summary</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we discussed some tools that allow you to create websites and web apps without writing code, or at least minimizing the code you have to write. You saw how things such as WordPress and Drupal can allow even non-technical users – to at least some extent – to create content for the web. You also saw how no-code offerings from companies such as GoDaddy or Wix can remove the need for web developers entirely… though you also saw how these tools can make you a more effective web developer, thereby (I believe!) reversing that notion.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, which begins the final part of this book, we’re going to put the technical stuff completely behind us and focus entirely on other concerns, things such as career development, skills growth, and landing your first web developer job. That’s ultimately the goal after all, and we’ll spend a few chapters figuring out how to get there together!</p>
