<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">Developers are an inherently lazy bunch. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">I know that sounds weird but hear me out! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.3">We are always looking for ways to write </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">less</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1"> code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">Sometimes, there is a good reason for that: if someone has already put a ton of time and effort into writing a library that, say, encrypts data, then why should we waste our time re-inventing that particular wheel? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">We probably shouldn’t in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">most cases.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">Instead, we’re always looking for tools to automate tasks, to generate code for us, or to otherwise save us from ourselves! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">Of course, I was being facetious earlier when I said we’re lazy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.3">No, it’s more about the efficient use of our time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.4">After all, you can hammer a nail into a piece of wood with a screwdriver if you need to, but it’s far faster and more efficient to use an actual hammer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.5">Just like in carpentry, choosing the right tool for a job is key in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">web development.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">So, after talking about writing code for a few chapters, we’re now going to talk about how to avoid doing just that – or, at least, minimizing it as much as possible and writing code with tools more efficiently! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.2">Especially when someone is paying you by the hour, you should always look to optimize your time as much as possible; there are tools for doing just that that you can avail yourself of, and that’s what this chapter is all about, starting with the concept of CMSs, including WordPress </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">and Drupal.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">We’ll then move on to so-called “no-code solutions,” platforms that allow you to build websites in a more visual way. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">Finally, we’ll talk about how the revolution in </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">artificial intelligence</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">AI</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">) happening </span><a id="_idIndexMarker832"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">right now can further enhance your ability to create without coding (at least not </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">as much).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">So, in this chapter, we’ll cover </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">the following:</span></span></p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-205"><a id="_idTextAnchor205"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">Introducing WordPress</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">The first thing we’re</span><a id="_idIndexMarker833"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1"> going to talk about is called a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">content management system</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">CMS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">A CMS is </span><a id="_idIndexMarker834"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">software that allows users to create, manage, and change content on a website without needing to have technical knowledge (or at least to minimize it as much </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">as possible).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">A typical CMS will allow users to create pages on a website, very often much like creating a document in Microsoft Word or any modern word processor, in a visual way. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.2">For example, they will allow you to drag images into place, add text around them, draw sections on the page, and otherwise create a page without writing code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.3">Then, a CMS will normally offer the ability to publish that content, so it is live for visitors, as well as provide management capabilities so that you can delete pages, reorganize them, modify them, and otherwise maintain them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.4">You can create an entire website with a CMS with about the same level of complexity as it takes to create </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">Word documents.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">A CMS can even supply more advanced functionality. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.2">For example, they can allow you to have a comment section on your pages where visitors can interact with one another socially. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.3">They can supply ways to hook into popular social media sites, accept uploads from users, implement polls to get feedback from your users, and many </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">other capabilities.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">There are many CMSs out there, but perhaps the most popular is WordPress. </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">WordPress</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1"> is an open-source CMS known especially for its ease of use, flexibility, and vast community that contributes plugins and themes that allow you to expand its functionality easily. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">WordPress was originally a blogging platform, but it has evolved to support a wide range of website types nowadays, including e-commerce, portfolios, and business sites. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.3">Almost anything you can think of can be done with WordPress because it is especially known for how customizable </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">it is.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">In </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">Figure 8</span></em></span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">.1</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">, you can see the site that is automatically created as a result of installing WordPress with basic, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">default options:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">It’s a great choice for both beginners and advanced developers due to its user-friendly interface and extensive documentation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">Many developers will build websites on WordPress, but</span><a id="_idIndexMarker835"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1"> non-technical users can use it just </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">as well.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">Let’s look at some of the key features of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">WordPress next.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-206"><a id="_idTextAnchor206"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">Key features</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">Some of the most important</span><a id="_idIndexMarker836"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1"> features that WordPress offers include </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">the following:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">Themes and plugins</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">: WordPress has thousands of themes and plugins available, allowing users to enhance the functionality and appearance of their websites without all that mucking about in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">Themes control the visual presentation, while plugins add features such as contact forms, user polls, message forms, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">e-commerce capabilities.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">SEO</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">: WordPress websites tend to rank well on search engines because they offer SEO-friendly features and plugins such as Yoast SEO to optimize content. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">The websites it produces are inherently geared toward SEO </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">by design.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">User-friendly</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">: WordPress has an intuitive dashboard interface that’s easy to navigate, making content management and site administration straightforward. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.2">Everything you need can be found in one place and presented in an </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">easy-to-understand way.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">Community</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">: With a large global community, WordPress has extensive forums, tutorials, and resources for troubleshooting and learning. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.2">You’ll never be out in the cold trying to figure something out on your own; help is always just a few </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">keystrokes away.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">Updates</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">: The WordPress team frequently updates their code for security and functionality, ensuring the software remains current, stable, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">and secure.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">Reach</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">: WordPress is widely used by bloggers, small businesses, and even large corporations, demonstrating its versatility and reliability as a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">website platform.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">The dashboard interface, which you can see in </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">Figure 8</span></em></span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">.2</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">, is the primary way you interact with WordPress. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.2">It allows you to control all of its functionality, and it’s worth seeing to understand how comprehensive WordPress really is. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.3">Of course, keep in mind that what you see in it </span><a id="_idIndexMarker837"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">may differ from installation to installation, depending on what plugins you </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">have installed.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">It’s also important to note that WordPress is not just one thing, not just a piece of software. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">It’s divided into two versions that serve different needs and have requirements different from yours as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">a developer:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">WordPress.org </span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">(</span><a href="http://wordpress.org"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">wordpress.org</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">): This is where you can find open-source software that’s free to use. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.2">To use it, you need to have a server to run it on, and most likely your own domain name will need to be purchased. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.3">It offers full customization with access to all plugins and themes, both free and premium. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.4">This version is ideal for those who want full control over their website’s functionality and design and who don’t have a problem with administering their own server and managing software </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">on it.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">WordPress.com </span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">(</span><a href="http://wordpress.com"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">wordpress.com</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">): This is a commercial offering that offers hosting of websites created with WordPress. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.2">With this version, you don’t need your own server and don’t need to install WordPress yourself; it’s all managed for you. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.3">You simply purchase a plan and get to building your website immediately, but it otherwise offers all the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker838"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">same capabilities </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">as self-hosting.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">That’s the functional angle, but what about the technology WordPress is built on? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.2">Let’s talk briefly </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">about that.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-207"><a id="_idTextAnchor207"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">Understanding the technical perspective</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">From a technical</span><a id="_idIndexMarker839"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1"> perspective, WordPress is a robust and versatile CMS with the following </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">technical characteristics:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">PHP</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">: WordPress is written in PHP. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.2">This handles server-side execution and provides all the functionality WordPress offers, including the ability to update WordPress itself seamlessly on a live site </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">without downtime.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">MySQL</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">: One of the most popular open-source relational databases out there, MySQL is used by WordPress to store the actual user-generated content, settings, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">user data.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">Plugins</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">: The ability to extend functionality without having to update to a whole new version of WordPress is what the plugin architecture enables. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.2">Through it, you can add custom features and functionalities modularly, without altering core </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">WordPress code.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">Themes</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">: The presentation layer of WordPress is controlled by themes, which are collections of PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that work together to dictate the visual layout and style of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">the site.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">The Loop</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">: This is a fundamental part of WordPress responsible for processing each post and displaying its content, allowing for dynamic content. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.2">Things such as showing a new blog post pulled from the database and displayed through a theme is what The Loop is all about. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.3">The basic structure of The Loop is </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">as follows:</span></span><pre class="source-code"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">
&lt;?php if (have_posts()) :    while (have_posts()) : the_post();      // Display post content     endwhile;endif;?&gt;</span></pre><p class="list-inset"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">The </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">have_posts()</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1"> function will determine whether there are any posts to be displayed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.2">If there are, the </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">while</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1"> loop begins. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.2">In that loop, for each post, the </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">the_post()</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1"> function is called to get the data for the post. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.2">Then, template files from the theme are used in conjunction with the data for the post. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.3">This data is inserted where specific tags in the templates are found, and the result is HTML to be displayed for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">each post.</span></span></p></li> <li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">REST API</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">: WordPress offers a robust REST API giving developers an interface to use to interact with </span><a id="_idIndexMarker840"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">a WordPress site remotely by sending and receiving JSON objects, making WordPress a headless CMS option. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.2">This means that you can store and manage your content in WordPress but display it through custom code if </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">you wish.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">Actions</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">: These are hooks (bits of code, essentially) that WordPress core executes at specific points during execution, or when specific events occur. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.2">Plugins can specify actions to execute at these points, providing a way to enhance WordPress when specific events occur, such as a user leaving a comment, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">for example.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">Filters</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">: These are bits of code that allow modification of data before it is saved or sent to the browser. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.2">This is crucial for customizing the functionality of WordPress without changing the core files. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.3">As some examples, filters can be used to automatically do things such as change the formatting of content (perhaps to highlight key phrases), place related posts beneath your content, or truncate text to ensure it always fits on the page in an aesthetically </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">pleasing way.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">Security measures</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">: WordPress has built-in security measures such as regular updates. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.2">But being a popular platform for online content, it’s a common target for attacks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.3">Thus, security is often bolstered with plugins, secure hosting, and best practices in website management. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.4">For example, some plugins can monitor for hack attempts and alert you, while others can enforce password policies for your users to promote more </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">secure passwords.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">Multisite capability</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">: WordPress allows running multiple sites from a single WordPress installation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.2">This allows for the efficient use of server resources: you don’t need to build a separate server for each WordPress site since one server can handle </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1">many sites.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">Compatibility and standards</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1">: WordPress always strives to follow web standards set by the W3C, ensuring compatibility with different browsers and devices and ensuring accessibility for those </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1">with disabilities.</span></span></li>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">Drupal is more of a developer-centric CMS in a sense, given that setting it up and using it requires more technical knowledge than WordPress. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.2">WordPress is designed from its core to be user-friendly and is geared toward non-technical users, whereas Drupal isn’t, at least not to the same extent. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.3">One of the key reasons is that where WordPress offers a hosted option, Drupal does not. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.4">You’ll be setting up your own instance of Drupal on your own server if you want to use it, and that simply requires more </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1">technical know-how.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.1">Also, WordPress is WYSIWYG out of the box, whereas Drupal is not. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.2">Drupal provides a more limited interface for creating and maintaining content, essentially just a text editor where you can apply some formatting. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.3">Creating full-fledged websites with Drupal requires more direct editing of content rather than just dragging and dropping elements around as in WordPress. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.4">That said, Drupal can be extended with plugins that can allow it to reach – more or less – parity with WordPress in this regard. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.5">Again, Drupal is more geared toward</span><a id="_idIndexMarker844"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1"> developers, and while you aren’t writing code per se, it’s closer to that than to WordPress’s visually oriented content </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.1">creation approach.</span></span></p>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-209"><a id="_idTextAnchor209"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">Key features</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.1">Some key points about </span><a id="_idIndexMarker846"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">Drupal to consider include </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">the following:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">PHP</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">: Like WordPress, Drupal is written in PHP, making it flexible </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1">and extensible.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.1">Database integration</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.1">: While WordPress only works with MySQL, Drupal supports multiple databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MariaDB, for storing content and settings. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.2">It does this by way of a database abstraction layer, which means an API that the Drupal code is written against, which then translates the Drupal function calls to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1">database-specific calls.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">Modularity and extensibility</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">: Instead of plugins, Drupal uses modules to extend its functionality. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.2">Different name, but same basic idea. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.3">There are thousands of community-contributed modules available for various features, including all the same sorts of things </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1">WordPress offers.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.1">Themes</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.1">: Similar to WordPress, Drupal uses themes to define the look and feel of a website. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.2">Themes in Drupal are highly customizable via HTML, CSS, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.1">JavaScript coding.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.1">Content structure</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.1">: Known for its powerful content structuring capabilities, Drupal allows the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker847"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.1"> creation of multiple content types with custom attributes and fields. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.2">It’s more than just web pages in Drupal land; it’s whatever type of content you need, be it videos, images, PDF files, Excel spreadsheets, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.1">so on.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.1">Access control</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.1">: Drupal provides an advanced user role and permission system, enabling granular access control for different types of users. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.2">Because Drupal is known for its strong security features, it is often chosen for government and enterprise websites. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.3">It also offers in-depth security reports and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.1">regular updates.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.1">Performance and scalability</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.1">: Drupal is designed from the ground up for performance and scalability, handling large amounts of data and traffic efficiently. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.2">It has built-in caching features and can be integrated with external caching systems for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.1">high-traffic websites.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.1">Community and ecosystem</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.1">: Drupal has an active community of developers, designers, and content managers, providing extensive support through forums, documentation, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.1">and events.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.1">API-first approach</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.1">: Drupal supports a </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.1">headless</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.1"> or </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.1">decoupled</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.1"> architecture, meaning that the frontend (what a user sees) is separated from the backend (where content is stored), allowing for more flexibility in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.1">content delivery.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.1">Multilingual capabilities</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.1">: Drupal offers extensive multilingual features out of the box, allowing for easy content translation and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.1">site localization.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.1">Version updates</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.1">: Unlike WordPress, which can be updated seamlessly, Drupal’s version updates are significant, often requiring considerable effort to migrate from one major version </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.1">to another.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.1">Drupal is particularly suited for complex, data-driven websites and those requiring extensive content organization, such as community platforms, online stores, and corporate websites. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.2">Its steep learning curve can be challenging for beginners but offers powerful solutions for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.1">experienced developers.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.1">Given that more </span><a id="_idIndexMarker848"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.1">developer-centric focus, you might imagine there is more to say about Drupal from a technical perspective, and you’re right, and that’s what we’re </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.1">discussing next.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-210"><a id="_idTextAnchor210"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.1">Understanding the technical perspective</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.1">From a technical </span><a id="_idIndexMarker849"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.1">perspective, Drupal stands out for its robust architecture, advanced customization capabilities, and strong focus on scalability and security. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.2">Here are some key </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.1">technical points:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.1">Modularity</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.1">: Drupal’s architecture is highly modular, allowing for extensive customization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.2">Core functionalities can be extended or overridden with </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.1">custom modules.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.1">Hook system</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.1">: Drupal employs a hook system that allows modules to interact with the core and alter or extend its behavior without modifying the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.1">core files.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.1">Performance</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.1">: As mentioned before, Drupal has extensive caching mechanisms (such as Page Cache and Block Cache) to improve performance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.2">It also supports robust integration with external caching systems such as Varnish and Memcached to further </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.1">improve performance.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.1">Theming</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.250.1">: Drupal uses the Twig templating engine, which is a flexible, secure, and fast templating engine, for implementing its themes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.250.2">Drupal themes are inherently responsive, ensuring websites work well on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.1">various devices.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.1">API-first approach</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.1">: Drupal supports RESTful APIs, allowing for headless or decoupled architectures where the frontend is separated from the backend. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.2">In fact, it does this internally, meaning that Drupal itself is conceptually separated </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.1">like this.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.1">Security</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.1">: Drupal offers a sophisticated </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.1">Role-Based Access Control</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.1">RBAC</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.1">) system, allowing </span><a id="_idIndexMarker850"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.1">detailed permissions and user management, generally considered to be more robust and better suited to the needs of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.1">large businesses.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.1">Quality assurance</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.1">: Drupal includes a comprehensive testing framework, supporting unit, functional, and integration testing, and it enforces strict coding standards, contributing</span><a id="_idIndexMarker851"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.1"> to the overall quality and maintainability of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.1">the code.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.1">Taxonomy system</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.1">: Drupal has a highly sophisticated taxonomy system, enabling intricate categorization and tagging </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.1">of content.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.1">Localization support</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.1">: Drupal has strong multilingual and localization capabilities built into the core, making it suitable for international and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.1">multi-language sites.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.1">Configuration management</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.1">: Drupal has a sophisticated configuration management system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.2">It allows developers to easily manage and transfer configuration changes from development to production environments, a critical feature for complex and large-scale website development. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.3">It is, in a sense, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.1">built-in DevOps!</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.1">Views module</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.1">: One of Drupal’s most powerful features, the Views module allows users to create, manage, and display lists of content. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.2">Unlike WordPress, where similar functionality is achieved through plugins, Views is integrated into Drupal core in its </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.1">recent versions.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.1">Block system</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.1">: Drupal’s block system is another key feature. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.2">It allows for the placement of content and other elements in region-specific blocks on a page, offering extensive </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.1">layout customization.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.1">APIs</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.1">: Drupal functions not only as a CMS but also as a framework, allowing developers to build custom applications on top of it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.2">It offers a range of APIs for different functionalities, such as database management, theming, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.1">user management.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.1">To summarize, Drupal is, in a sense, a developer’s CMS. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.2">Meanwhile, WordPress can still require some</span><a id="_idIndexMarker852"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.1"> technical knowledge, yet is much more focused on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.1">end users.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.1">But recently, a new kid on the block has arrived that takes the vision of WordPress to a whole new level, and that’s the land of no-code solutions, which is the next stop on our train ride to web </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.1">developer expertise!</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-211"><a id="_idTextAnchor211"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.1">Throwing away coding altogether – “no-code” solutions</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.1">While a CMS such as </span><a id="_idIndexMarker853"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.292.1">WordPress – and Drupal, to a lesser extent – can be user-friendly and can be used by non-technical users in the case of WordPress, there is a whole other class of tools that takes this a giant step further into the realm of no-code solutions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.292.2">WordPress really does come pretty close, and some would probably even argue that it </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.293.1">is literally</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.294.1"> a no-code solution, especially the WordPress.com side </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.295.1">of it.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.1">But true no-code solutions really step this paradigm up and become something that </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.297.1">anyone</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.1"> can use with virtually zero </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.1">technical knowledge.</span></span></p>
<p><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.1">No-code solutions</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.1"> are tools that allow users to build and manage applications and websites without the need for programming skills. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.2">These solutions are designed to be user-friendly, often using drag-and-drop interfaces and pre-built templates, and generally present a visual development environment to the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.302.1">non-technical user.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.1">These solutions democratize web app and website development, enabling business professionals, entrepreneurs, and hobbyists to create digital content. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.2">And, while you definitely can create robust web apps with them, it’s more common to find more static websites being built with them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.3">This is largely down to the visual development paradigm they typically employ: it’s far easier to represent static content in a visual builder tool than it is dynamic interactions (though not impossible, to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.304.1">be clear).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.305.1">No-code solutions are particularly popular among small businesses, start-ups, and non-technical users in larger organizations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.305.2">They can be used to build websites, mobile apps, and internal business applications and even to automate </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.1">business workflows.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.1">It’s important to note that no-code solutions are not usually something you install yourself and they aren’t pieces of software per se. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.2">Almost always, they are themselves websites that you go to that provide all the functionality you need in one place. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.3">You don’t need to worry about servers, domain names, or, of course, programming or anything else because these solutions are all-encompassing, including hosting. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.4">You’ll build your website there, and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker854"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.308.1">it will be immediately available on the internet at the click of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.1">a button.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.310.1">The key aspects of these no-code solutions include </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.1">the following:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.312.1">User interface (UI)</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.313.1">: No-code</span><a id="_idIndexMarker855"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.1"> solutions usually feature a GUI that allows users to build apps and websites by visually manipulating elements. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.2">This can include dragging and dropping components such as text boxes, buttons, and images onto </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.315.1">a canvas.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.1">Customization</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.1">: Although no-code solutions offer less customization than hand-coding does, many of these solutions provide a range of templates and modules that can be tailored to meet specific needs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.2">Users can often customize the look and feel of their results, again in a visually driven way that doesn’t </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.318.1">require coding.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.319.1">Integration</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.1">: Many no-code solutions offer integrations with other software and services at the click of a button. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.2">This allows users to connect their no-code solutions with existing tools and systems, such as databases, CRM systems, or </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.1">email servers.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.322.1">Data handling and analytics</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.1">: Many no-code solutions offer built-in tools for data management, analytics, and reporting. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.2">Users can create forms, manage databases, and visualize data without coding. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.3">This feature is particularly useful for businesses that need to gather insights about how their website is being accessed, or for dealing with data generally, but who lack the technical expertise for complex </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.324.1">data handling.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.1">Collaboration</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.1">: No-code solutions often emphasize collaboration, allowing multiple users to work on a project simultaneously. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.2">This can include version control, role-based access, and real-time editing, but with a more user-friendly model than even something such as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.327.1">GitHub provides.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.1">Responsive design</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.1">: Most no-code solutions automatically ensure that the generated results are responsive, meaning they will adapt to different screen sizes, from desktops to smartphones. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.2">This is crucial in today’s </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.330.1">multi-device environment.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.331.1">Marketplaces</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.1">: Some no-code solutions offer marketplaces where users can find additional plugins or extensions, created either by the solution provider or third-party developers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.2">These add-ons can extend the functionality of the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.333.1">base platform.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.334.1">Community and support</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.335.1">: The rise of no-code solutions has had the result of creating vibrant user communities where people share tips, templates, and best practices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.335.2">Most </span><a id="_idIndexMarker856"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.336.1">solutions also offer robust customer support and educational resources to help users maximize the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.337.1">solution’s potential.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.1">Cross-platform</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.1">: No-code solutions can be used from any device, regardless of hardware specifications, OS, or other considerations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.2">This makes them more accessible to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.1">more people.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.1">Security and compliance</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.1">: Any good no-code solution will be designed with security in mind and adhere to industry-standard compliance regulations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.2">It’ll ultimately be up to the users of these solutions how to implement it, but the tools for solid security should </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.1">be provided.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.1">Economic impact</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.1">: By enabling more people to build websites and web apps, no-code solutions are lowering the barrier to entry in the tech world, potentially leading to more innovation and economic growth, especially in sectors where technology adoption was </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.346.1">previously limited.</span></span></li>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.1">The primary advantage of no-code solutions is speed and efficiency. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.2">Since there is no custom programming needed, they tend to be faster to create. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.3">This also makes them more cost-effective since no (often times expensive) web developers are needed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.4">This all has the result of empowering non-developers, allowing those without coding skills to take part in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.1">development process.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.357.1">In the case of GoDaddy’s web designer, for example, it allows an exclusively visual-based approach to designing, a paradigm where the user drags and drops components around the page and can edit details about each as necessary, all </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.1">without coding.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.1">Of course, it isn’t all roses and rainbows when it comes to no-code solutions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.2">For one thing, as an organization’s needs grow and evolve, the limitations of no-code solutions may become apparent because they may not supply the flexibility you need at some point. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.3">While they are excellent for the quick deployment and validation of ideas, transitioning to more customizable, code-based solutions might be necessary for scaling and complex customization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.4">That said, most good no-code solutions will grow with you for a while and provide fertile ground to start your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.360.1">online journey.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.1">For another thing, no-code solutions make you dependent on the provider of that solution. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.2">While this isn’t the case when you host your own hardware, no-code solutions do tend to bind you to them more deeply, and it can be difficult to move away from them if and when needed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.3">This won’t be a problem for many people, of course, but it’s something to be aware of as at least a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.1">potential issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.1">No-code solutions</span><a id="_idIndexMarker858"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.364.1"> represent a significant shift in the technology landscape, making app and web development more accessible and altering traditional dynamics in the tech industry by allowing non-coders to produce results that until now have required </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.365.1">custom development.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.366.1">Let’s now talk about some of the biggest names in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.367.1">no-code movement.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-212"><a id="_idTextAnchor212"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.368.1">Introducing some popular no-code solutions</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.369.1">In the realm of web</span><a id="_idIndexMarker859"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.370.1"> development, several popular no-code solutions have gained widespread recognition for their ease of use and powerful features. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.370.2">Here are some </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.371.1">notable examples:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.372.1">Wix</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.373.1">: Wix is very similar to GoDaddy in approach, again providing a visual design toolset that doesn’t require any coding. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.373.2">It arguably tends to be slightly less user-friendly than GoDaddy, but the difference isn’t drastic </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.1">if so.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.375.1">Squarespace</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.1">: Squarespace is favored for its sleek, professionally designed templates, making it ideal for portfolios, blogs, and business websites. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.2">It offers robust design options and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.377.1">e-commerce capabilities.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.378.1">Weebly</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.1">: A user-friendly solution with drag-and-drop tools, Weebly is great for small businesses and online stores. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.2">It integrates e-commerce features and provides various </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.380.1">design templates.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.1">Shopify</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.382.1">: Primarily focused on e-commerce, Shopify allows users to create online stores without coding. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.382.2">It offers extensive e-commerce tools, templates, and integration with a wide range of payment gateways and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.1">other services.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.1">Carrd</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.1">: Specializing in one-page websites, Carrd is a simple, lightweight tool for creating personal profiles, landing pages, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.1">simple portfolios.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.1">Bubble</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.1">: While it’s more focused on web applications than websites, Bubble is a powerful no-code tool that allows for the development of complex, data-driven web applications with a visual </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.1">programming interface.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.390.1">These solutions stand out for their ease of use, diverse design options, and ability to cater to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.1">various needs.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.1">But what if even </span><a id="_idIndexMarker860"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.393.1">drag-and-drop and a visual builder are too much for someone? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.393.2">Well, there’s something that has crashed onto the scene like little else that may give an answer, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.1">that’s AI.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-213"><a id="_idTextAnchor213"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.395.1">Utilizing artificial intelligence</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.1">AI isn’t new. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.2">It’s been</span><a id="_idIndexMarker861"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.1"> around since around 1956 in various forms, but 2023 was a watershed moment for it in which we saw a sudden explosion of innovation </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.398.1">in space.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.1">Many of the no-code solutions out there are now adding AI capabilities to the mix. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.2">GoDaddy and Wix both</span><a id="_idIndexMarker862"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.1"> incorporate </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.401.1">artificial design intelligence</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.402.1">, or </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.403.1">ADI</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.2">This is a form of AI that simplifies the design process by automatically creating a website based on the user’s responses to a set of questions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.3">This approach is particularly beneficial for those who want a professional-looking website without investing much time or needing technical skills. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.4">You simply answer a series of questions, such as what your website is about, where it’s located, and any key points about it, and these platforms can create a website from those responses that, while not a complete and ready-to-go result, serves as a good starting point for your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.1">design work.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.406.1">Of course, such a thing isn’t without its limitations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.406.2">Reliance on ADI means that websites may lack uniqueness since AI isn’t yet </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.407.1">quite</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.408.1"> as creative as humans can be, and users might find the designs somewhat limited compared to competitors since there have to be guardrails in place for any AI, limits to what it can produce. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.408.2">While being able to produce a website with a simple description is incredibly powerful (and I would even say cool!), it doesn’t offer as much creative freedom and lacks certain advanced features, such as the ability to integrate third-party apps </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.409.1">as effectively.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.410.1">This AI-driven no-code solution is best suited for businesses or individuals who need a simple, clean, and professional website quickly and are not looking to delve deeply into customizations or advanced features. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.410.2">It’s particularly user-friendly and affordable, with various pricing plans, including a free option, making it a practical choice for small businesses or entrepreneurs </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.411.1">starting out.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.412.1">But this is just</span><a id="_idIndexMarker863"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.413.1"> one specific example of a more generic concept, a concept that has really taken the world by storm and that you as a web developer can use in other ways, and that concept is called generative AI. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.413.2">Let’s delve into that a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.414.1">little deeper.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.416.1">You would have to</span><a id="_idIndexMarker864"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.1"> have been living under a rock for most of 2023 to have not heard of generative AI. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.2">AI itself isn’t new, of course, it’s been around since around 1956 in various forms, but 2023 was a watershed moment for it when ChatGPT, the poster child for generative AI, hit </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.1">the scene.</span></span></p>
<p><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.419.1">Generative AI</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.420.1"> is a type of AI that can create new content, be it text, images, programming code, music, or even whole websites. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.420.2">It does this by first ingesting a large amount of data and, in a sense, learning from it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.420.3">This data can be many things, including books, existing music, source code from GitHub, and documents of various types. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.420.4">The AI can understand the patterns and structure of this data and then use it to generate new (arguably) original output. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.420.5">For example, generative AI such as ChatGPT can write a news article, compose a piece of music, or create an image that never existed before. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.420.6">As you can probably tell, generative AI has the potential to revolutionize the way websites – and a lot of other things – are built, offering new levels of efficiency, customization, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.421.1">and creativity.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.1">In terms of how AI like this works, and without getting into all the complex math and concepts that underly them, the main component is what results from ingesting all of the data I mentioned: something called a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.423.1">model</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.424.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.424.2">It’s a complex representation of all of the data in the form of a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.425.1">neural network</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.426.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.426.2">A neural network is essentially an algorithm specifically built to be able to recognize patterns, which is similar to how the human brain works. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.426.3">When you ask ChatGPT a question, it uses complex statistics to traverse this model, finding patterns that match what it statistically believes follows logically from each step in the traversal. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.426.4">In the end, they output something that the model statistically sees as being most likely to answer the request that was put </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.427.1">to it.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.428.1">There are many different</span><a id="_idIndexMarker865"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.429.1"> models, trained from many different datasets. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.429.2">GPT, which underlies ChatGPT (which is really a combination of a UI plus that model), is specifically for textual content. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.429.3">Another model, DALL-E, was trained on a large set of images and can produce new ones from it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.429.4">The more data a model is trained on – assuming the data is of sufficient quality – the more productive and accurate it becomes at fulfilling requests </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.430.1">to it.</span></span></p>

<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.445.1">Prototyping and wireframing</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.446.1">: Generative AI tools can quickly generate website prototypes and wireframes, allowing designers to visualize and refine their ideas more rapidly than they probably </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.447.1">could otherwise.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.448.1">Automated design creation</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.449.1">: Generative AI can generate website layouts and designs based on user preferences or predefined criteria – or even prototypes and wireframes it previously generated! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.449.2">Some of the big no-code solutions are beginning to integrate these kinds of capabilities to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.450.1">incredible effect.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.451.1">Copy generation</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.1">: Generative AI can be used to create textual content for websites. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.2">For instance, it can generate product descriptions, blog posts, or marketing copy tailored to the site’s audience, saving time and effort on the part of humans (which, generically, is what most of this boils down </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.453.1">to frankly).</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.454.1">Visual asset creation</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.455.1">: Generative AI can generate visual assets such as images, icons, or even animations that are tailored to the website’s theme </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.456.1">and requirements.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.457.1">Code generation</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.458.1">: Generative AI can generate the actual code needed to build websites, especially for standard components. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.458.2">This can significantly speed up the development process, although it may require oversight and refinement from human developers, which is a common theme with any generative AI model. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.458.3">I’ll go into this a bit more in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.459.1">next section.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.1">SEO optimization</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.461.1">: AI can analyze search engine algorithms and suggest or implement SEO strategies for better ranking, including keyword optimization, meta tags, and content structuring. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.461.2">For example, it can analyze the top results from a search you want your site to be ranked higher in, and then see what changes could be made to your site to achieve </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.462.1">that goal.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.463.1">Personalization</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.464.1">: AI can personalize website experiences for individual visitors in real time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.464.2">It can change layouts, content, and recommendations based on user behavior, preferences, and interactions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.464.3">This is different than the previous points in that here we’re not talking about using AI to build a website; instead, we’re talking about AI that runs on behalf of the user, as they’re actually using </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.465.1">a website.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.466.1">UI and UX optimization</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.467.1">: As with personalization, AI can analyze user interaction data after a website is live to suggest improvements in the UI/UX design. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.467.2">This could come in the form of training a model on data collected from users using your site, from which you can then extract suggestions from the model about things </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.468.1">to improve.</span></span></li>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.469.1">The integration of</span><a id="_idIndexMarker867"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.470.1"> generative AI and other forms of advanced AI systems into web development tools and solutions is still something that is evolving. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.470.2">We’re still figuring out how to use these new techniques and tools. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.470.3">As AI technology advances though, it seems likely that it will become an integral part of the web development process, offering more sophisticated and intuitive ways to build websites. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.470.4">I don’t personally believe it will replace web developers, but web developers will certainly have to understand and adapt to these tools, integrating them into their toolbox. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.470.5">It seems likely to me that those who don’t will probably be left behind, so if for no other reason than the selfish “I want to be employable” perspective, it’s important to be aware of AI advancements and keep up with how they can be used to make you a more effective </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.471.1">web developer.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.472.1">One last area of this topic I want to discuss is how you can use generative AI tools to write code, with one way in particular at the forefront: </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.473.1">GitHub Copilot.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-215"><a id="_idTextAnchor215"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.474.1">GitHub Copilot</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.475.1">While the idea</span><a id="_idIndexMarker868"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.476.1"> of generative AI being used to generate whole websites or content for sites, or being used as tools to help build and enhance websites, was the thrust of the previous section, here I want to talk about the idea of using it to write code: in other words, continuing to be web developers, but using tools to make that job easier and more efficient. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.476.2">While ChatGPT can be used in that way because it’s quite good at being able to generate code for you, or helping you troubleshoot your code, these capabilities are taken to another level when you use a good IDE with Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot integrated </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.477.1">into it.</span></span></p>
<p><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.478.1">Copilot</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.479.1"> is actually powered by the GPT model, the same one (or, at least, one of several available) that ChatGPT uses. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.479.2">But the training data that the model is based on is all the content on GitHub (well, any content that hasn’t been explicitly disallowed for this purpose </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.480.1">at least).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.481.1">It allows for two</span><a id="_idIndexMarker869"/> <span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.482.1">key capabilities:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.483.1">The ability to have the code you write </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.484.1">be autocompleted</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.485.1">The ability to generate code </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.486.1">from comments</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.487.1">You can find information on how to install Copilot on your specific IDE (it supports most of them) here: </span><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.488.1">https://docs.github.com/en/copilot</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.489.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.489.2">Then, as you type your code, Copilot can </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.490.1">suggest completions.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.491.1">And let me tell you, it can get scary good at it sometimes! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.491.2">Since it is aware of the code in your project, as well as all the repositories hosted on GitHub, it’s able to offer suggestions that make sense within the code you’re writing – contextually meaningful suggestions, not just random gibberish pulled from other </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.492.1">people’s code.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.503.1">Microsoft calls Copilot “your AI pair programmer.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.503.2">Pair programming is an idea where two developers sit</span><a id="_idIndexMarker870"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.504.1"> down physically together and code together. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.504.2">One person may control the keyboard, or it may pass between them, and you write code in a pair, both of your brains working together, hopefully harmoniously! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.504.3">If you’ve ever seen the movie </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.505.1">Pacific Rim</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.506.1">, it’s a lot like the Drift that allows two pilots to control the Jaegers, the giant robots used to fight the Kaiju (the giant monsters), sharing the mental strain. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.506.2">With Copilot, your partner is in a sense all the developers who have code posted </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.507.1">on GitHub!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.1">Aside from those autocompletion suggestions, Copilot has another trick up its sleeve. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.2">If you type up some comments, in plain language, describing a function, Copilot can then produce that function for you! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.3">It’s really kind of amazing when you see it </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.509.1">in action.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.520.1">As of the time of writing, a third capability – chat – is becoming generally available. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.520.2">This puts a mechanism just like ChatGPT into Copilot. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.520.3">Now, you can have a back-and-forth discussion with </span><a id="_idIndexMarker871"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.521.1">Copilot about some tricky programming issue you’re having, or ask for documentation about something, to generate code or test cases, and to help you with debugging. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.521.2">While ChatGPT can do all of this too, having it integrated into your IDE and having it be immediately aware of what you’re working on already is game-changing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.521.3">Unlike ChatGPT though, chat in Copilot can only answer questions about coding; it by design isn’t as general-purpose as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.522.1">ChatGPT is.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.1">And here’s the good news: you can play with Copilot for free! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.2">Microsoft offers a fairly generous free trial period, after which Copilot costs a nominal fee (as of the time of writing, $10 a month for an individual). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.3">I for one find it to be very much worth </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.524.1">the expense.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.525.1">Now, that all may sound great, but here’s the one big warning with Copilot, and for any generative AI actually: </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.526.1">you can’t blindly trust them</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.527.1">! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.527.2">Generative AI models are known to </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.1">hallucinate</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.529.1">, which is to say they make things up that are basically gibberish. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.529.2">Of course, we are in fact asking the AI to make things up, but we expect those things to be valid, and they aren’t always. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.529.3">In the same vein, the answers these models produce are sometimes factually incorrect. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.529.4">They simply get things wrong sometimes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.529.5">Often, it’s because the training data was flawed, and sometimes it’s because the complex math that underpins them simply leads to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.530.1">incorrect answers.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.531.1">Check out </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.532.1">Figure 8</span></em></span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.533.1">.9</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.534.1"> for an example of this. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.534.2">While trying to figure out a problem at work, I asked a question about dates in JavaScript, and the answer it gave wasn’t correct. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.534.3">Though I pointed this out to the AI and it corrected itself, if I didn’t have some foundational knowledge already, I probably wouldn’t have spotted that, and I might have been sent off down the wrong path, wasting time and energy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.534.4">So, you must keep an eye on these things</span><a id="_idIndexMarker872"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.535.1"> and not just rely on them 100%, which is the point I’m </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.536.1">making here.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.545.1">You shouldn’t</span><a id="_idIndexMarker873"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.546.1"> undersell the ability to – without shame – ask question after question after question, even if you think some of them are “stupid.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.546.2">Especially in the early days of your web developer journey, you’re going to have a lot of questions that may be hard to get answers for with a search engine such as Google, and that you might be embarrassed to ask a person about, if you even have someone you can ask. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.546.3">Well, first, you really shouldn’t be embarrassed because we all start at a point of not knowing everything, and asking questions is how you learn! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.546.4">But I get it: we’re people and sometimes we feel like we’re asking </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.547.1">silly questions.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.1">Well, ChatGPT or Copilot is never going to judge you! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.2">You can keep asking it as many questions as you need to, keep asking it for different examples or different explanations, and it’ll keep trying as long as you need it to. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.3">You can build your knowledge over time with it, keep going off on tangents as much as you need, and it’ll never get tired or annoyed with you. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.4">It’s a capability we haven’t as a society had before, and it really can </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.549.1">be transformational.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.550.1">So, I strongly encourage you to start using these generative AI tools, be it ChatGPT or Copilot, or whatever else is out there or comes out after these words have been committed to paper. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.550.2">As I said, don’t trust them 100% because they </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.551.1">do</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.1"> get things wrong, but in my experience, they do more than a good enough job for the benefits to far outweigh </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.553.1">any negatives.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.554.1">While some worry that this new breed of AI tools and no-code solutions may take our jobs in the long run, I for one think the opposite will happen: these tools will become necessary tools that web developers will have to come to terms with and learn how to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.555.1">use effectively.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.556.1">And hey, if they ultimately turn into Skynet and send Terminators after all of us, at least we will have built</span><a id="_idIndexMarker874"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.557.1"> some great websites in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.558.1">meantime, right?</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.578.1">In this chapter, we discussed some tools that allow you to create websites and web apps without writing code, or at least minimizing the code you have to write. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.578.2">You saw how things such as WordPress and Drupal can allow even non-technical users – to at least some extent – to create content for the web. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.578.3">You also saw how no-code offerings from companies such as GoDaddy or Wix can remove the need for web developers entirely… though you also saw how these tools can make you a more effective web developer, thereby (I believe!) reversing </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.579.1">that notion.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.580.1">In the next chapter, which begins the final part of this book, we’re going to put the technical stuff completely behind us and focus entirely on other concerns, things such as career development, skills growth, and landing your first web developer job. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.580.2">That’s ultimately the goal after all, and we’ll spend a few chapters figuring out how to get </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.581.1">there together!</span></span></p>
