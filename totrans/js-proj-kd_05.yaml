- en: In this chapter, we are going to develop a full game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    We will focus on the JavaScript coding, therefore, we will not care about the
    graphics of the game. We will code a game named **Battleship**. Many of you have
    heard of it before. This is a memory game. Your imagination and intuition will
    help you to win the game. There are a few variations for playing the game.

- en: In this chapter, we built a complete game and played it. We also played a better
    version of the game we have built. All you need to remember is that you must know
    the logic behind all the code that we previously discussed. You are given the
    source code of the better version of the game with this chapter. I hope that you
    will study the code and write your own Battleship game. We used a `jquery.js`
    JavaScript file on our improved version of the Battleship. The `jquery.js` file
    has a lot of lines of code (We will discuss this in [Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Exploring
    the Benefits of jQuery"), *Exploring the Benefits of jQuery*).
