While meeting this demand is becoming increasingly business critical, the complexities of development are amplified by the explosion in devices and platforms. Mobile JavaScript frameworks have been available since the start of the smartphone revolution and is the perfect platform to meet these challenges. Recognizing the cross-platform nature of these frameworks, enterprises have begun to rely on them for building cost-effective yet compelling cross-platform solutions.</p><p>With an innovative architecture, Appcelerator's Titanium Mobile stands out for its rapid development speed, large number of APIs, and focus on providing a native experience. With a thriving community and a growing number of enterprise partners, Titanium has quickly become one of the largest cross-platform mobile frameworks.</p><p>
<em>Appcelerator Titanium Business Application Development Cookbook</em> shows how you can create native mobile apps using your existing JavaScript skills. Through a series of examples and supporting code, all aspects needed for Enterprise Titanium development are covered. You will learn to use a single JavaScript codebase to develop cross-platform enterprise mobile apps for iOS and Android.</p><p>Beginning with a discussion on design patterns, the practical recipes in this cookbook progress through different topics required for Enterprise mobile development. Each recipe within this cookbook is a self-contained lesson. Feel free to pick and choose which recipes are of interest and use them as a reference on your Titanium projects. Recipes in this book demonstrate how to work with data on the device, create charts and graphs, and interact with various web services. Later recipes discuss application security and native module development, which provide additional resources to accelerate your next Titanium mobile development project.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
