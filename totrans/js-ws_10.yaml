    HTTP to APIs; perform service calls using a library such as jQuery and native
    XMLHttpRequest and be familiar with the pros and cons of each approach; use an
    external API to retrieve data using JavaScript; use some jQuery functionality
    for the UI and events; and identify cross-domain-capable APIs and use cross-domain
    requests.

    This chapter will cover the other side of services – you will learn how to call
    them from the client-side. There's a good chance that services being accessed
    are, in fact, implemented in Node.js, but it is common for them to run on other
    platforms as well, such as Java, C#, and Python.

    a set of technologies that provide standards for your web page to communicate
    with other servers and sites to exchange data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To enable services implemented in different languages to communicate with each
    other, they need to have common rules regarding how the requests and responses
    being exchanged should look and be structured. For this reason, there are a number
    of different standards and approaches to web services out there that define the
    format of data being exchanged. The most popular combination used for websites
    today is **REST** with **JSON**, which stands for **Representational State Transfer**
    with **JavaScript Object Notation**. This chapter will describe in detail all
    you need to know in order to call REST services to provide data for your web pages.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before web services came about, web servers needed to gather all required data
    on the server-side before rendering the final HTML they would serve. To get a
    fresh update, the entire page had to be redrawn. The user experience of the pages
    was constantly affected, especially if the data involved complex calculations
    or queries, as the user would need to wait until redrawing was complete and didn't
    have the ability to use any other functionality on the page in the meantime.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, think of a page that displays stock quotes or email messages. In
    the old days, you would have to reload or refresh the whole page in the browser
    to see whether there were any updates to the stock quotes or whether you had any
    new mail. Web services and dynamic HTML changed this, as it is now common for
    pages to only update portions at a time without needing to reload and redraw the
    entire page.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note that many web services use a different technology, known as **SOAP**, which
    stands for **Simple Object Access Protocol** with an **XML** (**eXtensible Markup
    Language**) format. There are some emerging standards as well that are gaining
    traction, such as Google's protocol buffers. While each of these technologies
    has its advantages and disadvantages and use cases where they are appropriate,
    we will only focus on REST and JSON in this book as they are the most widespread
    methods in use today.

    right at home with the syntax of JSON, as it is derived from JavaScript and closely
    resembles object structures you have already learned in previous chapters. JSON,

    and write, and easy for machines to parse and work with.

- en: Most JavaScript is synchronous, which means there is only a single thread of
    execution, and only one operation can be executed at a time. If browsers were
    truly synchronous, websites would be a drag to use, as only one resource would
    be able to load at a time. Imagine if the images on websites only drew one at
    a time after loading! Sometimes, requests can take a long time, such as to do
    a calculation or a complex database query. You wouldn't want your site to become
    non-responsive while a request is processing!

    Also, in between requests being made and a response is received, the main thread
    of execution can continue to execute and potentially issue more service calls.

    `XMLHttpRequest`. Normally, there is a preference to use native functionality
    that is built-in to JavaScript, but in my opinion, `XMLHttpRequest` is too low-level
    and difficult to use most of the time. This is a use case where utilizing a library
    makes more sense and really simplifies your code. (However, we will also cover
    `XMLHttpRequest` later in this chapter.)

    section of the HTML before the `<body>` tag. This code could potentially be loaded

    to making REST calls using jQuery and callbacks is just one of many different
    options available and was presented first as it's the most straightforward and
    easy-to-understand option for novice users. This is not to say the approach is
    not powerful though. And it is really all that is needed in many cases. Remember
    that jQuery offers other functionality you may want to use in your application
    as well.

    may be appropriate to be used in your projects, Axios and the Fetch API. These
    use advanced concepts such as promises, so they will not be covered here but will
    be covered in *Chapter 15, Asynchronous Tasks* of the advanced module. (Note that
    even jQuery itself offers variations on the AJAX methods that return promises
    instead of using callbacks, but this usage is not in the scope of this chapter
    either.)

- en: When selecting or implementing a REST API, there is an important rule to be
    aware of that can impact whether the API can be used for your site. Browsers have
    a security feature known as the **Same Origin Policy**. This policy only allows
    scripts running on a site to access data from URLs on the same site with no specific
    restrictions but prevents scripts from accessing data that is hosted on a different
    domain. The reason for this policy is to prevent different types of attacks unscrupulous
    people can make by exploiting browser security weaknesses to steal your data or
    invoke malicious service calls.

    However, if the domain differs, even just in a different subdomain such as [https://www.foobar.mygreatsite.com/my_data.json](https://www.foobar.mygreatsite.com/my_data.json),
    the browser would respond with an error such as the following:'

    The details of the implementation of these workarounds are on the server side
    and are not in the scope of this chapter. But it is sufficient to know that APIs
    can be designed in a way that makes them data available across sites. So, when
    selecting APIs to use for your project, you'll need to investigate whether it
    is cross-domain capable. (The API we used in the earlier exercise, TheSportsDB,
