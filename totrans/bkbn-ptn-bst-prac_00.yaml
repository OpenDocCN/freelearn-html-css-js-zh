- en: Though Backbone.js provides a structure for JavaScript applications, developers
    need to take care of most of the design patterns and best practices themselves.
    Over the years, my JavaScript development team and I worked on multiple Backbone.js
    applications ranging from simple to extremely complex. We experienced different
    types of problems related to layout management, project architecture, modular
    development, and so on. Before I started writing this book, I spent a significant
    amount of time trying to figure out solutions for all the common problems associated
    with the development of Backbone.js applications. In this book, I have documented
    all my findings in detail.

- en: Whether you are an intermediate- or advanced-level Backbone.js developer, this
    book will guide you through the best practices and patterns to handle different
    issues with each Backbone component. Whether this is by using your own solution
    or an existing Backbone plugin, you will get a clear idea of the best way to resolve
    any problem.

- en: Instead of developing a single application spanning all the chapters, a simple
    and complete example on each topic is provided separately throughout this book.
    This is because it would be quite difficult to implement all the tips and patterns
    given in this book in a single application. Moreover, we preferred to provide
    immediate and compact solutions to problems, instead of including all the problems
    and solutions in a single large application. Within a short span, this book tries
    to cover all the important points you may need for the development of your Backbone.js
    application.

    *Reducing Boilerplate with Plugin Development*, starts with the basics of why
    reusing your code is important, and how we can achieve that by creating custom

    discusses the different points related to view rendering and layout management.
    Starting from partial updating of views, functionality of nested views or subviews
    for different processes of JavaScript template management and best practices,
    this chapter covers most of the problems a developer may face while working with
    views. We conclude by writing about the Marionette custom views and the Layout
    Manager plugin for complex app layout management.'
