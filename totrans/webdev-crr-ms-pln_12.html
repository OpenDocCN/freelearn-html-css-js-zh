<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">In the last chapter, we talked about soft skills, those things that aren’t, for the most part at least, technical in nature. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">You learned how those skills and qualities are things that you can develop in yourself and that will aid you in your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">career aspirations.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">This chapter is, in a sense, an extension of that last one. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">However, rather than focusing on soft skills, we’ll focus largely on the kinds of things you can do to develop yourself in terms of your technical ability. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">This will be done with an eye on one thing: growing </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">your career.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">It’s important to think about how you can improve yourself, especially if you have aspirations beyond simply getting an entry-level web developer job. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">So, in this chapter, you’ll learn about some of the more advanced positions you might look to as you grow, and how you can develop the skills to get there. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.3">This will include things such as pursuing certifications, contributing to open source projects in order to learn and demonstrate your abilities, and the idea of side projects, something I talked about in the last chapter as well (so if you’re looking for the one thing I consider to be of primary importance, that’s probably a good indicator right there: talking about it in two chapters!). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.4">I’ll also discuss ways you can work to keep up with changes in the industry, something that is of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">paramount importance.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">Putting all of this together, I will attempt to give you pointers that, if followed, should allow you to keep up with the industry – as well as any of us can, anyway – and always be advancing your skillset in pursuit of climbing the web developer career ladder as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">you desire.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">In this chapter, we’ll cover </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">the following:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">ABC – Always </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">Be Coding!</span></span></li>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-302"><a id="_idTextAnchor302"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">ABC – Always Be Coding!</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1">In </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">Glengarry Glen Ross</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">, a movie about the dark, cutthroat side of sales, the character Blake, played by Alec Baldwin, gives a rather famous speech about the phrase “always be closing.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">He illustrates this </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1096"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">phrase on a blackboard by explaining it as “ABC.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">In the context of that movie, it’s discussing how a good salesperson is always trying to close a sale, always trying to push that last little bit to get the prospective buyer to bite and finalize </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">a deal.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">In the context of web development, I’m playing the part of Blake and rephrasing ABC to mean “Always </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">Be Coding”!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">It’s a simple enough concept: web development is a very fast-paced field. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">So fast, in fact, that we make all sorts of jokes about it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.3">The framework that is the belle of the ball one week might be verboten the following week. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.4">Well, I’m exaggerating a little bit for effect there, but once you’ve been doing this for a while, you’ll start to realize it’s not nearly as exaggerated as you’d wish it was, sometimes! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.5">Keeping up is a chore for anyone, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">believe me!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">This means that the skills you have can be less appealing before long if you aren’t careful. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">What it also means is that if you don’t use a particular set of skills for a while, they tend to atrophy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.3">I spent about six years in the 80s doing nothing but Assembly language programming, a very low-level language that looks something </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">like this:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">If I had been doing Assembly these past few decades, though, the story would be very different. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">Those skills would be fresh in my mind, and this would be second nature like it used to be. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.3">So, the trick is ABC: Always </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">Be Coding!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">Now, the natural question to ask is what to code, and early in your career, the simple answer is </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">anything</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">I said as much in the last chapter too, but there, it was in the context of learning, and how learning by doing is usually the best way to solidify knowledge in your brain. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.3">But even if you aren’t learning new skills, it’s also important to maintain old ones. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.4">While Assembly is a language I’ll likely never have to use professionally in my life (and there’s even a low chance I’ll do it in my own projects), practicing any type of coding keeps the more general “programming </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">skills” fresh.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">That’s the thing: </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">specific</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1"> skills can be allowed to fade, but just the general knowledge of how to program, and how to write code, is something that you can’t allow to fade. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">And the best way I know to avoid that is to </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1098"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">always keep those juices flowing by </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">always coding.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">In the last chapter, I talked about personal projects and how games are an excellent choice that can keep your coding abilities strong and maybe even expand them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">While I stand by games being a fantastic choice, it certainly isn’t the only choice. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.3">It almost doesn’t matter what you code, as long as you code </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">something</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.2">Another possibility I like to suggest is a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">PIM</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">, a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">personal information manager</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.2">This is an application that allows you to store, manage, and utilize important </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1099"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">pieces of personal information, usually things such as contacts, appointments, and notes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.2">I like this idea so much, in fact, that I’ve used such a project in a good number of my books, as you can see in </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">Figure 12</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">.1</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">It’s a good choice because, like games, you’ll have to confront a lot of different programming topics, and they</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1100"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1"> can also be done with any technology. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">You can, of course, build it with React and Node, Angular and Java, or just plain HTML + CSS + JS with client-side data storage. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.3">Or, do it in Python and have a purely text-based interface. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.4">You can host it in a cloud provider if you like, or on your own home server. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.5">It works in any permutation of technologies and is challenging enough to keep your skills sharp while not being </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">overly difficult.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">But again, this is just one idea. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">Hopefully, you‘ve begun to realize that you like coding and building websites, solving problems, and all of what goes into it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.3">If so, then finding ways to continually be coding, either working on one project or another, probably won‘t be so difficult. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.4">And again, none of it has to see the light of day! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.5">Nothing says you have to share your work with anyone else, or even use it after you write it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.6">In fact, you don‘t necessarily even have to </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">finish</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1"> a project! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.2">My private source code repository is littered with aborted projects and ideas I dropped halfway through for one reason or another, and most developers are </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">that way.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">But you know what? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.2">I go back to those projects a lot because I realize that some part of it is still valuable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.3">And even </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1101"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">though they weren’t completed, I gained experience in new technologies from them, experimented with new techniques and ideas, and just generally sharpened my skills as I worked on them, and that’s what ABC is </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">all about.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">Of course, writing code is only one part of keeping your skills sharp. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">Reading code is just as important, and there‘s a facility that I find a lot of developers forget or ignore these days, one I‘ve mentioned before but that is worth a second mention, and that‘s good ‘ole </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">View Source.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-303"><a id="_idTextAnchor303"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">Viewing Source is your friend</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">There’s a common</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1102"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1"> saying that, for a developer, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">reading</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1"> code is just as important as writing code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.2">In fact, many would say it’s </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">more</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1"> important. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.2">It’s also said that most developers spend more time reading code than writing code – whether it’s understanding an existing code base they must support, reading through their own code to remember how they did things, or reading the code of others for learning, it’s a skill all of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">its own.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">Seeing how others have done things is an especially valuable exercise. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.2">To be sure, it isn’t always easy because you will inevitably run into things you don’t know, be it techniques, styles, new libraries, or what have you. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.3">It can be an exercise in frustration, but it’s too valuable to let that </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">stop you.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">Previously, I mentioned the View Source option, which has been a part of web browsers for decades now. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.2">This is something that developers sometimes forget is there! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.3">To some extent, that‘s because browser developer tools have mostly taken the place of View Source, but no matter how you do it specifically, I’m generically talking about the idea of looking at the work </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">of others.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">When you go to a website and see something cool, in most cases, you can use View Source or developer tools to examine the code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.2">Now, this isn‘t quite as true as it used to be due to modern developer techniques. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.3">In the olden days of the late 90s/early 2000s, View Source was great because what you got was pure, untouched HTML, CSS, and JS. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.4">There was no mystery; it was all right there for you to examine and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">learn from.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">That’s still true in the sense that HTML, CSS, and JS are the lingua franca of the web. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.2">No matter what developer tools, libraries, frameworks, or toolkits you use to build a website, it always boils down to HTML, CSS, and JS. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.3">There may be many different abstractions on top of the final code that the browser runs, but it still boils down to those three in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">the end.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">But the final form that the browser</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1103"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1"> uses to display the web page can differ drastically nowadays from what the developer wrote owing to those abstractions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.2">If they developed the web page with TypeScript, for example, the output code can sometimes look drastically different in its final JS form. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.3">Or, if they used Angular or React, then the code they wrote can look virtually nothing like what runs in the browser. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.4">There are also tools called </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">obfuscators</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">, which explicitly try </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1104"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">to make the code look as different as possible and explicitly more difficult to read. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.2">There are also compressors (called </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">minifiers</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">) that try to minimize the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1105"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1"> size of the code in an attempt to make loading the page more efficient, but this too can make it harder to read. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.2">So, code is sometimes hard to read by accident, and sometimes on purpose, but it ultimately makes View Source less useful than it used </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">to be.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">Still, you can sometimes gain valuable insights even by looking at obfuscated code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.2">Even if you can’t quite work out the exact code that is responsible for a given effect, for example, you may still be able to get a conceptual idea of how it’s done, which is often all you’re </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">really after.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">While modern code may be difficult to read, there are some things to be aware of that can help. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.2">The main one is something called </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">source maps</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.2">These are special files that can be part of the output when compressing or</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1106"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1"> obfuscating JS, or when transpiling from TypeScript to JS, offering a way to map code within a file, as seen in the browser, back to its original source code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.2">They enable a developer to examine code more easily by showing the original source code in a code viewer or debugger, even if the code running in the browser (or Node, or another runtime environment) is the minified or transpiled version. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.3">This mapping between the code at runtime and the original source code is crucial for debugging purposes and being able to learn </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">from it.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">Source maps are completely optional, unfortunately, so there‘s no guarantee they will be present. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.2">But when they are, what you wind up with is final code in a file named </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">example.min.js</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1"> that might look something </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">like this:</span></span></p>
<pre class="source-code"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">
function a(a,b){return a+b}function s(a,b){return a-b}
//# sourceMappingURL=example.min.js.map</span></pre> <p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">This can be used just as any JS file is in a </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1107"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">web page, as shown in the following </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">simple HTML:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1">It’s not just for learning about how others have done things, though, that View Source is so valuable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.2">Another thing it allows you to do is to “think like a hacker” to find security vulnerabilities in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">your work.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-304"><a id="_idTextAnchor304"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1">Thinking like a hacker</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.1">What I mean by “think like a hacker” is the idea that you can use View Source, and browser developer tools in general, to put on your “white hat” and find vulnerabilities in your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1">own code.</span></span></p>
<p class="callout-heading"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.1">Types of hackers</span></p>
<p class="callout"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.1">Hackers – people </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1110"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.1">who examine websites and applications looking for security vulnerabilities – come in several varieties, typically denoted by “hat color.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.2">White hat hackers, otherwise known as “ethical hackers,” are</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1111"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.1"> those who operate legally and with the consent of a target with the express intent of finding and disclosing vulnerabilities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.2">These people are often engaged by companies to find flaws in their sites. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.3">Black hats are those who use their skills for illegal or malicious purposes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.4">Their motives frequently involve financial gain, espionage, or just to cause chaos. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.5">Grey hats fall somewhere in between, in that they look for vulnerabilities with the intent of disclosing them rather than exploiting them for nefarious purposes, but they do not operate with the consent or pre-knowledge of a target. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.6">Companies often have a love/hate relationship with grey hats because while it’s good for someone like that to find a problem and let the company know before the black hats do, it’s still rather disconcerting to get a report from </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.1">someone unsolicited.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.1">You have to change your mindset to do this, looking at the code not for what it is but for what you can do with it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.2">Can you, for example, find a password embedded in the code that is used when calling your REST API? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.3">That’s a very obvious security problem; however, it won’t usually be that easy, so you’ll have to start coming at this sideways. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.4">Like, can you see a place where you might be able to hack the code to add some nefarious SQL to a server call – a SQL injection attack, in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.1">other words?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.1">As long as it‘s your own code, this is all perfectly fine. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.2">But there‘s nothing to stop you from putting on your grey hat instead and looking at other people’s code too. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.3">As alluded to in the previous note box, you have to be careful about that because not every company will appreciate you doing so. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.4">But it can still be a learning experience for you because you can start to see patterns that you should avoid in your own work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.5">Seeing the mistakes made by others is a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.1">valuable thing!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.1">Don’t be afraid to dig in and see how others have done things; whether for security purposes or not, that’s the bottom line. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.2">View Source is there for you to do so, as are the more advanced dev tools available in modern browsers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.3">With them, you can learn a lot if you take the time to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.1">do so.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.1">Another way you can enhance</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1112"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.1"> your skills, as well as your employability, is certifications, those shiny pieces of (oftentimes virtual, nowadays) paper that purport to tell others what you know. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.2">Let‘s see what those are </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">all about!</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-305"><a id="_idTextAnchor305"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.1">Certifying your greatness</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">Certifications, those (sometimes) shiny </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1113"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">pieces of paper that (sometimes) hang on your wall, are a way to declare to the world “I know all about X!” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.2">where X is some technology or skill. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.3">They are like college degrees but without the need to sit in a classroom. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.4">You see, you can go take a test on, for example, web development, and if you pass, you’ll get a certification that is meant to say that you have attained a certain level of skill in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">web development.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">There are hundreds if not thousands of certifications available. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.2">Some are administered by private companies (probably most of them are) on the specific technologies that are their primary source of income, some by government agencies, and some by organizations whose entire business model is providing certification exams. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.3">They cover all sorts of topics from cloud computing to cybersecurity, networking, AI and ML, data management and analysis, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1">project management.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.1">Some certifications are free, but most cost money to get. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.2">How much? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.3">Anywhere from a few tens of dollars to thousands. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.4">Some are frankly very easy; the tests are fairly superficial and don’t require in-depth knowledge. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.5">Others – such as the networking tests administered by the company Cisco – are kind of notorious for being very difficult and requiring hands-on demonstrations of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.1">your skill.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1">But before you think about getting a certification of any kind, it’s worth asking a simple question: is it really worth the time, money, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">and effort?</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-306"><a id="_idTextAnchor306"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">Are they worth getting?</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1">People in the technology world </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1114"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.1">have historically had a bit of a love/hate relationship with certifications, and the thinking about them has changed over time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.2">20-30 years ago, almost any certification was worth something. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.3">They set you apart from the field when it came to getting hired because not everyone had them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.4">At that time, spending a few hundred or even a few thousand dollars collecting a few certifications was a good way to help get your foot in the door, or perhaps help you get a raise </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.1">or promotion.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.1">Nowadays, it’s not quite so clear-cut. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.2">Some people put little stock in certifications at all because at the end of the day, if you’re someone who knows how to study and take tests, the thinking goes that you could conceivably get many certifications without having any actual experience in the topic you’re </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.1">testing for.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.1">To give a concrete example of that, nearly 25 years ago, I got a Novell administrator’s certification, where Novell is a long-gone operating system that used to be pretty popular in data centers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.2">I knew the basics of Novell, sure, and I had a </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.1">little bit</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.1"> of hands-on experience, but I was in </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1115"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.1">no way qualified to be an actual administrator of a real production Novell system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.2">Despite that, I picked up a study book, read it cover to cover a time or two, and managed to pass the test because I’ve always been pretty good at regurgitating information for tests. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.3">So, effectively, that certification never really indicated my true level of knowledge about Novell; it much more just showed my ability to study and pass </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.1">a test.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.1">Unfortunately, that’s how some people see </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.1">any</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.1"> certification these days. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.2">But I think that’s unfair, because not all certifications are created equal. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.3">Some, like the Novell test, can be passed by someone with just basic knowledge and experience, but that would never have worked for one of the Cisco tests, for example. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.4">Those require you to really know your stuff and to be able to show it in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.1">practical ways.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.1">As a general statement, certifications become less important over time because your past experience, in a sense, becomes your certification. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.2">If you’ve actually built one or more complex websites, then that shows me, as a hiring manager, what you know better than virtually any certification </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.1">ever could.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.1">So, it may sound like this is all a bit contradictory, and that’s because, in a sense, it is! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.2">There’s a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.1">tension here.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.1">On the one hand, if you’re trying to get your first job and don’t have a lot of experience to show, then I would say there is some value in certifications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.2">They won’t have the same value to every interviewer regardless, but for those who give them more weight, it may be the difference between getting hired and not. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.3">I would say, don’t spend an inordinate amount of time and money on them, though; look for the ones that (a) aren’t too expensive, and (b) you can pass based on what you </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.1">actually</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.1"> know and without a huge investment of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.1">study time.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.1">On the other hand, as you build up some real work experience, my personal opinion – which I don’t believe I’m alone in – is to not put </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.1">as much</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.1"> stock in certifications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.2">It may still make sense to pursue one every now and again in a more targeted and focused way, such as if you are looking to switch positions and want to have as much evidence that you can do the new job</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1116"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.1"> as possible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.2">But “collecting certifications” – where you just keep getting them with the thought that it </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.1">may</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.1"> be beneficial to your career generally – is probably a bit of wasted time, effort, and money. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.2">It’s probably better to spend the time building things to gain experience through doing, so you have more demonstrative evidence of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.1">your skills.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.1">For what it’s worth, early in my career, I went through a phase of collecting certifications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.2">At last count, I held something like 90 different certifications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.3">While some, such as the Novell one, didn’t really reflect my knowledge and abilities at the time, a lot of them actually did. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.4">But either way, the simple fact is that they never had any tangible benefit to my career. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.5">They didn’t help me get my first job (I didn’t have any before then), nor did they help me get any big salary increase later (proving what I could do on the job very much did, though). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.6">Do I feel all that time and money was worth it? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.7">No, I honestly don’t. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.8">I think it’s true that I learned some things from the studying I did for them, though, so in that sense, I probably did get some benefit, but not enough to justify the time </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.1">and money.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.1">So, if you’re going to go for certifications at all, I think doing so surgically is the smart move; that’s the point of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.1">that anecdote.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.1">Let’s say you decide to pursue certifications, whether to help get your first job or later on, for whatever reason. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.2">With so many certifications out there, how do you choose which to go after? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.3">Let’s look at some of the most popular ones these days and see what it takes to get them, and which are likely to have the most benefit </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.1">to you.</span></span></p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-316"><a id="_idTextAnchor316"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.459.1">Giving back to get back</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.1">Over my many years as a developer/architect/lead/technical manager, one thing that I’ve come to understand is that when you help others, you almost always wind up helping yourself in the process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.2">This comes in many forms. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.3">Helping a coworker with a problem often leads to you gaining insights you didn’t have before. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.4">Teaching others helps solidify knowledge in your own mind. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.5">And when you contribute to projects, you gain a sense of accomplishment on top of whatever technical benefits you </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.461.1">also get.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.462.1">Therefore, I always look for ways I can “give back” to others. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.462.2">I say give back because we all depend on others, whether they taught us, helped us through problems, or simply created software and tools that we depend on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.462.3">Looking for opportunities to do the same thing yourself is a great way to build your skillset and other intangible </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.463.1">qualities too.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.464.1">Let’s talk about some ways you might look to give back. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.464.2">Which way works for you is something you, of course, need to discover for yourself, and this is by no means an exhaustive list. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.464.3">But hopefully, it gives you some ideas going forward on things you </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.465.1">might do.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-317"><a id="_idTextAnchor317"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.466.1">Open source contributions</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.467.1">One of the best – and also one of the easiest – ways to give back is to contribute to open-source projects (the abbreviation </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.468.1">FOSS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.469.1">, short for </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.470.1">free/open-source software</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.471.1">, is typically used, and I will do so here). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.471.2">You can, of course, start your own; there’s nothing wrong with</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1143"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.472.1"> that and it has a lot </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1144"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.473.1">of benefits. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.473.2">But here, I’m focusing on finding projects you like and contributing </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.474.1">to them.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.475.1">A lot of developers are nervous about getting involved in projects, especially early on in their own learning, because they figure there’s nothing they could possibly contribute. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.475.2">Let me assure you that this is wrong! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.475.3">FOSS projects are often in need of people doing things that don’t require a high level of technical skill. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.475.4">For example, documentation is something that a lot of projects are lacking and that the maintainers of projects are all too happy to have people </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.476.1">help with.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.477.1">In fact, your relative inexperience could actually be a blessing: writing simpler “introductory” documentation, as someone new to using a project would need, is something you can probably handle since you would have to go through that learning process yourself to be able to write such documentation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.477.2">You may well save others time getting up to speed with such a contribution, which is for sure a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.478.1">valuable thing.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.479.1">There’s no permission to get – you just start writing! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.479.2">You’ll likely need to clone the project’s repo, as was discussed in </span><a href="B18315_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor105"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.480.1">Chapter 4</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.481.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.481.2">That gives you a local copy on your own machine that you can then start hacking at without any risk to the existing project’s code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.481.3">If things don’t go well, it’s no big deal; you can always clone a fresh copy and start again, no harm </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.482.1">no foul.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.483.1">But eventually, when you’ve made good progress, you can send a pull request (assuming the project is using GitHub) when you believe the documentation is ready. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.483.2">To be sure, there’s no guarantee it </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1145"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.484.1">will be accepted, or that there won’t be comments sent back about things they’d like to see. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.484.2">But very often, you’ll get a great, big “thank you!” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.484.3">and an </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.485.1">immediate acceptance.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.486.1">Looking at the existing bugs for a project and submitting fixes is another great way to contribute. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.486.2">It’s obviously great for the project to get bugs resolved, but it’s fantastic for you too because not only does it help you learn the code base of the project so you can contribute more in the future, but it means you’re reading code and learning from it, so selfishly, it’s going to benefit you greatly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.486.3">And you don’t need to tackle the trickiest bugs right off the bat! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.486.4">Finding ones that appear to be on the simpler side, even “silly” things such as maybe a label on a screen having a spelling mistake, can get your foot in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.487.1">the door.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.488.1">Eventually, you can look at a project and think “Okay, what feature could I add that I think people would like?” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.488.2">and go for it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.488.3">When you get to this point, you may want to have some discussions on a message forum or mailing list of Discord – however the project members communicate – to get some level of buy-in so you don’t wind up wasting a lot of time on something that ultimately won’t have a chance of being accepted (then again, just the experience of building the feature can benefit you, so keep that in mind too). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.488.4">It’s also good to know you won’t start working on something that a project member is already </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.489.1">working on.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.490.1">Maybe the website of the project is a bit lacking. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.490.2">In such a case, you might offer to build something a bit more robust. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.490.3">Things are a little different in this regard than they used to be because most FOSS projects are hosted on sites such as GitHub, and they may not have their own unique website, as was most common years ago. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.490.4">But it’s still the case that projects will often want to have their own “face,” so to speak, even if they’re hosted on GitHub, and offering to build that – and maybe offering up some design ideas or prototypes to make the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1146"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.491.1">case – can be something that will be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.492.1">valued too.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.493.1">You can also often get involved in FOSS projects just by becoming an </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.494.1">SME</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.495.1">, or </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.496.1">subject matter expert</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.497.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.497.2">If you get to know a project</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1147"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.498.1"> well, you can begin to help people on message forums who are having problems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.498.2">That’s a contribution that will be appreciated not only by the users of the project but also by the maintainers, since they can then focus more on writing code than </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.499.1">helping people.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.500.1">FOSS is all about community at the end of the day, so finding ways you can help the community is what it’s all about. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.500.2">Whether that means documentation, coding, or just answering questions, it </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.501.1">all counts.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-318"><a id="_idTextAnchor318"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.502.1">Presentations</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.503.1">Another way to give back is to give</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1148"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.504.1"> presentations at events such as user groups and meetups. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.504.2">This will help you solidify your technical knowledge because, of course, you’ll need to study and learn to create your presentation and to be prepared for questions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.504.3">But this also has the benefit of getting you experience in speaking to a crowd, which is a valuable skill </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.505.1">to have.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.506.1">All you really need to do is choose a topic you’re confident about and find a suitable group to present to. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.506.2">The website </span><a href="http://meetup.com"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.507.1">meetup.com</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.1"> is a great resource for this. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.2">You’ll likely want to start small, so find smaller, local groups that deal with the topic you want to present, and simply contact the organizers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.3">Those folks are usually quite receptive to someone wanting to give a presentation because otherwise, they have to put in effort to find people themselves. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.4">It’s always good to make peoples’ </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.509.1">jobs easier!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.510.1">If you’ve never given a presentation before, it will be quite nerve-racking at first. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.510.2">Speaking in front of a crowd, whether large or small, is something that frightens people. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.510.3">As with most things, the more you do it, the more comfortable with it you’ll become, so I say, jump in with both feet! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.510.4">Face the nerves and fight </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.511.1">through them!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.512.1">That said, how do you give a good presentation? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.512.2">Some general guidelines can help you </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.513.1">do this:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.514.1">Assuming you have a slide deck built in something such as Microsoft PowerPoint, have just one topic per slide. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.514.2">You want to be sure you don’t overload your audience </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1149"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.515.1">with too much information at once, and overly dense slides do </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.516.1">just that.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.517.1">Show, don’t just tell. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.517.2">This is as good advice for presentations as it is for fiction writing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.517.3">If you can show the results of a bit of code, then do so, rather than simply telling your audience what it </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.518.1">will do.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.519.1">Don’t simply read your slides! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.519.2">This is a very common problem, and it gets noticed quickly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.519.3">Your audience can read the slide just fine on their own; your job is to expand on what’s there as they </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.520.1">read it.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.521.1">Going hand-in-hand with the previous point: limit each slide to one or maybe two sentences. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.521.2">Again, overly-dense slides just split the audience’s attention. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.521.3">They’re there to hear you speak, not read a bunch of text. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.521.4">One or two sentences that frame what you’re saying are all </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.522.1">you need.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.1">Each slide should account for a minute or two of time, generally speaking. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.2">Presentations, such as stories, should keep moving at a decent pace. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.3">There will, of course, be exceptions, but keeping things moving at this rate is a good </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.524.1">general guideline.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.525.1">Use graphics when possible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.525.2">As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.525.3">A good image, graph, or screenshot can tell a story better than a bunch of words, whether printed or spoken (well, sometimes – each instance has to be examined on its own merits – but it’s a good </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.526.1">guideline generally).</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.527.1">If possible, have one or two “WOW!” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.527.2">moments in your presentation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.527.3">This might be near the end where you put everything you’ve said together in some way, or it might be right at the start where you demonstrate something impressive that you’ll be discussing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.527.4">Or it may be one or two moments in between. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.527.5">In any case, it’s a great way to get and keep your audience engaged and feeling like they are spending their </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.1">time well.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.529.1">And, of course, practice! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.529.2">Many people like to present in a mirror; others prefer to get their significant other to listen to them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.529.3">There are even </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1150"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.530.1">places online where you can practice in front of “people,” even in VR! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.530.2">One such site is </span><a href="https://virtualorator.com"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.531.1">https://virtualorator.com</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.532.1">, which allows you to practice in a simulated environment that is very similar to the real thing, assuming you have the appropriate </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.533.1">VR equipment.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-319"><a id="_idTextAnchor319"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.534.1">Blogging</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.535.1">Something else you can do is write independent articles – blogging, as we call it today. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.535.2">Sites such as </span><a href="http://medium.com"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.536.1">medium.com</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.537.1"> make this very easy to do and can potentially earn you some money in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.538.1">the process.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.539.1">Getting started is as easy as signing up for an account, and then starting to type! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.539.2">You’ll need to do all the appropriate research on</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1151"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.540.1"> whatever topic you’re writing about, create examples if appropriate, and learn to edit and review your work before publishing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.540.2">But there’s no real barrier to entry other than your own drive </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.541.1">and motivation.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.542.1">Medium isn’t the only such site, nor do you even have to use such a site. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.542.2">You can instead self-host your articles, perhaps using something such as WordPress, or just creating your own site from scratch, which has the bonus of showing off what you can do. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.542.3">The big difference is that using a site such as Medium will likely get your work in front of more people faster because technical readers congregate there, in a sense, whereas if it’s your own site, you’ll need to get into advertising and awareness yourself. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.542.4">You could start on Medium and build a bit of an audience who knows your work and then migrate to your own site </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.543.1">as well.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.544.1">When writing such articles, a few things to remember are </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.545.1">as follows:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.546.1">It’s inevitable, no matter how well you think you’ve done, that </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.547.1">someone</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.1"> is going to criticize your work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.2">It’s just the reality of the world we live in. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.3">So, be ready for it when it comes, grow a thick skin, and see whether there’s anything of value in the criticism. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.4">There could be a nugget of truth wrapped in some unkind words that you can get some benefit from if you can find it (of course, there will always be a few people who are just mean for the sake of being mean, so you’ll need to learn how and when to simply ignore </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.549.1">people too).</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.550.1">Remember that your articles don’t necessarily need to be huge and grandiose to bring value to people. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.550.2">Sometimes, just a few paragraphs might be all someone needs to have a “eureka!” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.550.3">moment, and they’ll thank you for it just as much as if you had written a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.551.1">full-length book.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.1">Choose topics that </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1152"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.553.1">you’re passionate about. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.553.2">People can usually tell when a writer is just going through the motions or when they are actually excited about what they’re writing about. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.553.3">Be the latter, because it always comes </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.554.1">across better.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-320"><a id="_idTextAnchor320"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.555.1">Technical reviewer for authors</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.556.1">Another way you can give back is to be a technical reviewer of books such as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.557.1">this one!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.558.1">Whenever an author writes a technical book, they need people to go over it and keep them honest, making sure they haven’t made any technical mistakes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.558.2">Writing a book ain’t easy, believe me, and no matter </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1153"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.559.1">how hard you try, there’s usually something that doesn’t work right. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.559.2">Maybe there are differences across operating systems you didn’t know about. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.559.3">Maybe there are different versions of libraries that you didn’t use when writing the example code that breaks those examples. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.559.4">Maybe you simply didn’t explain something as clearly as you thought you did. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.559.5">All of this is where technical reviewers come </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.560.1">into play.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.561.1">Being a technical reviewer requires you to read, test, and look for problems that readers might encounter. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.561.2">Sometimes, you’ll have to be an expert yourself in the topic the book is about, but often, it can almost be better if you aren’t. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.561.3">That’s because it’s logical to think that most technical books are being read by people who are trying to learn, not by those who are already experts in a given topic. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.561.4">Given that supposition, it therefore makes sense that a technical reviewer might not be either (though, certainly, you would always be expected to have </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.562.1">some</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.563.1"> knowledge going in – it largely comes down to how a given publisher </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.564.1">approaches things).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.565.1">How do you get a gig as a technical reviewer? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.565.2">Well, there are essentially three ways. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.565.3">One is that you can be someone who is found and approached. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.565.4">For example, if you’ve written a bunch of articles on React, then a publisher working on a React book might notice you and approach you, recognizing that you’re someone who knows their stuff. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.565.5">Another way is to know the author. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.565.6">Authors are often asked whether they know anyone who could serve as a technical reviewer, so if you have a strong network then you may get asked by people you are acquainted with who are writing books. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.565.7">The third way is to simply approach a publisher! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.565.8">Go to their website and look for contact links for editors, or maybe acquisition people, and send them a note saying you’re interested in being a technical reviewer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.565.9">You might not hit paydirt right away, but you also may find your name added to a list that gets you contacted </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.566.1">later on.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.567.1">I’ll give you a bonus fourth</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1154"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.568.1"> way, too: read existing books, look for mistakes, and send error data to the publisher. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.568.2">Not only will you hone your technical reviewer skills and help authors and publishers, but you might get noticed if you submit many, and that could lead to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.569.1">opportunities later.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-321"><a id="_idTextAnchor321"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.570.1">Writing books yourself</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.571.1">Of course, you may, at some point, move beyond being a blogger or technical reviewer and decide that writing a book yourself might be something you want </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.572.1">to do.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.573.1">Publishers such as Packt are pretty receptive to new authors, so if it’s something you think you might want to do then definitely give it a shot. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.573.2">You may even get approached by a publisher at some point if they see your writing out there already, but you can always approach them yourself. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.573.3">Most if not all publishers have links on their sites that direct you on how to submit book proposals to them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.573.4">Typically, that involves submitting some overview information about what you want to write, and often, they’ll want a rough outline that shows what the book will be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.574.1">like too.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.575.1">It’s kind of like fishing, really: you drop some bait in the water in the form of your proposal, and then wait for a bite! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.575.2">Once it comes, then the hard </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.576.1">work begins!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.577.1">And while it’s a lot of hard work, it has big benefits for you. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.577.2">For starters, learning and practicing how to explain yourself clearly is one, given that’s a key requirement of any book. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.577.3">Another benefit is that as an author, there’s an expectation that you know the material you write about well, but since no one knows it all, you may have to do some research and learn about it as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.578.1">you go.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.579.1">And, having on your resume that you wrote a book or two doesn’t </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.580.1">look half-bad!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.581.1">Plus, should you wind up writing a hit book, there can be some very nice financial benefits too. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.581.2">The publishing industry has gotten a bit tougher since the internet became what it is today, but people do still read and even often prefer books, so there can still be gold in them thar hills. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.581.3">But even if you don’t get rich writing a book, the benefits you get from it aside from money can make it a worthwhile experience. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.581.4">Just keep in mind that it’s going to be a lot of hard work, so be prepared for that going in. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.581.5">But as long as you are, go for it, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.582.1">I say!</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-322"><a id="_idTextAnchor322"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.583.1">Mentoring</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.584.1">The final way you can give back is to become a mentor. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.584.2">I focus more on being a mentor because being a teacher usually requires standardized certifications, degrees, and other accreditations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.584.3">Being a mentor, however, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.585.1">normally doesn’t.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.586.1">Who can you mentor? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.586.2">Well, it can really be anyone, but one good possibility is older folks around your town. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.586.3">Perhaps there is a senior center near you, or an active center for older adults. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.586.4">These types of places </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1155"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.587.1">sometimes have night sessions for people who want to learn technical skills. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.587.2">Now, there may not be quite as much call for web development learning there, but you never know! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.587.3">And even if there’s not, teaching people how to use computers generally, and how to use the World Wide Web, can be very valuable to them and help you ensure you know your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.588.1">basics too.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.589.1">Another way you can sometimes get into mentoring is to frequent online social sites where people are discussing web development and look for people who are themselves looking for help. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.589.2">Sometimes, you’ll see someone outright asking for a mentor, someone to guide them in their learning. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.589.3">Jump in and offer to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.590.1">help them!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.591.1">There are also some sites specific to finding and being mentors. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.591.2">One example is </span><a href="http://mentorcruise.com"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.592.1">mentorcruise.com</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.593.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.593.2">While you can become a mentor on this site and earn some money, that will oftentimes be a secondary concern to simply helping people. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.593.3">Being a mentor is a time commitment, though, so you have to make sure you’re ready for that. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.593.4">That might entail a lot of time or not very much at all; it simply depends on the arrangement </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.594.1">you make.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.595.1">The overarching message of this section is that you help yourself in various ways when you help others. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.595.2">Yes, that might be in the form of additional income, but that’s not really what it’s all about. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.595.3">It’s really about the positive feelings you get from helping others, and the benefits to your skills and knowledge that come from helping others </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.596.1">with theirs.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.597.1">But regardless of whether you choose to mentor or not, it’s all probably driving toward building your career over time, advancing yourself through various positions as you grow. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.597.2">Let’s talk about some of the positions you might </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.598.1">aspire to.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-323"><a id="_idTextAnchor323"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.599.1">Advanced positions to aspire to</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.600.1">To be a web developer is, on its own, a fine goal. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.600.2">And you may find it to be completely rewarding and fulfilling. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.600.3">I had a manager many years ago who willingly took a pay </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.601.1">cut</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.602.1"> just so he could go back to being just a programmer because he loved that part of his job but discovered he really hated the management part </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.603.1">of it.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.604.1">On the other hand, some people find out that they enjoy managing people, directing projects, and doing all the sorts of things that managers</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1156"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.605.1"> and higher-ups typically do. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.605.2">And there may come a time when you’re looking around, having been a web developer for a while, and you start to think, “I might be ready for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.606.1">new challenges.”</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.607.1">Fortunately, web developers can progress through several advanced stages in their career if they want to, all the way up to executive positions such as chief information officer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.607.2">To give you an idea of the types of jobs you might wind up doing in your potential career progression, let’s look at some of the most common titles you </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.608.1">might encounter.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.609.1">To be clear, there is no definitive guide to getting ahead in this field (or really any other!). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.609.2">But given what is generally known about the various roles and what they require, we can put together some general advice that should help you get to each </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.610.1">new role.</span></span></p>
