<h1 id="_idParaDest-301"><a id="_idTextAnchor301"/>Growing Your Career</h1>
<p>In the last chapter, we talked about soft skills, those things that aren’t, for the most part at least, technical in nature. You learned how those skills and qualities are things that you can develop in yourself and that will aid you in your career aspirations.</p>
<p>This chapter is, in a sense, an extension of that last one. However, rather than focusing on soft skills, we’ll focus largely on the kinds of things you can do to develop yourself in terms of your technical ability. This will be done with an eye on one thing: growing your career.</p>
<p>It’s important to think about how you can improve yourself, especially if you have aspirations beyond simply getting an entry-level web developer job. So, in this chapter, you’ll learn about some of the more advanced positions you might look to as you grow, and how you can develop the skills to get there. This will include things such as pursuing certifications, contributing to open source projects in order to learn and demonstrate your abilities, and the idea of side projects, something I talked about in the last chapter as well (so if you’re looking for the one thing I consider to be of primary importance, that’s probably a good indicator right there: talking about it in two chapters!). I’ll also discuss ways you can work to keep up with changes in the industry, something that is of paramount importance.</p>
<p>Putting all of this together, I will attempt to give you pointers that, if followed, should allow you to keep up with the industry – as well as any of us can, anyway – and always be advancing your skillset in pursuit of climbing the web developer career ladder as you desire.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>ABC – Always Be Coding!</li>
<li>Viewing Source is your friend</li>
<li>Certifying your greatness</li>
<li>Keeping up with the Joneses</li>
<li>Giving back to get back</li>
<li>Advanced positions to aspire to</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-302"><a id="_idTextAnchor302"/>ABC – Always Be Coding!</h1>
<p>In <em class="italic">Glengarry Glen Ross</em>, a movie about the dark, cutthroat side of sales, the character Blake, played by Alec Baldwin, gives a rather famous speech about the phrase “always be closing.” He illustrates this <a id="_idIndexMarker1096"/>phrase on a blackboard by explaining it as “ABC.” In the context of that movie, it’s discussing how a good salesperson is always trying to close a sale, always trying to push that last little bit to get the prospective buyer to bite and finalize a deal.</p>
<p>In the context of web development, I’m playing the part of Blake and rephrasing ABC to mean “Always Be Coding”!</p>
<p>It’s a simple enough concept: web development is a very fast-paced field. So fast, in fact, that we make all sorts of jokes about it. The framework that is the belle of the ball one week might be verboten the following week. Well, I’m exaggerating a little bit for effect there, but once you’ve been doing this for a while, you’ll start to realize it’s not nearly as exaggerated as you’d wish it was, sometimes! Keeping up is a chore for anyone, believe me!</p>
<p>This means that the skills you have can be less appealing before long if you aren’t careful. What it also means is that if you don’t use a particular set of skills for a while, they tend to atrophy. I spent about six years in the 80s doing nothing but Assembly language programming, a very low-level language that looks something like this:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
JSR $E544
SEI
LDA #$7F
STA $DC0D
LDA #$01
STA $D01A
LDX #&gt;IRQ

CPX #$08
BNE LOOP
JMP $EA31
COLOR .BYTE 6,$E,3,1,1,3,$E,6
DELAY .BYTE 1,9,8,9,9,8,8,9</pre> <p>Now, look, you’re not even <em class="italic">remotely </em>supposed to understand that! But here’s the thing: <em class="italic">neither do I</em>! And I literally <em class="italic">wrote</em> that code! The thing is, I haven’t done Assembly coding in almost 30 years at this point, so those skills have long since drained from my brain. It’s not <em class="italic">quite</em> gibberish to me<a id="_idIndexMarker1097"/> at this point, as some pieces of Assembly knowledge still float around in the back of my mind, but it’s pretty <em class="italic">close</em> to gibberish!</p>
<p>If I had been doing Assembly these past few decades, though, the story would be very different. Those skills would be fresh in my mind, and this would be second nature like it used to be. So, the trick is ABC: Always Be Coding!</p>
<p>Now, the natural question to ask is what to code, and early in your career, the simple answer is <em class="italic">anything</em>! I said as much in the last chapter too, but there, it was in the context of learning, and how learning by doing is usually the best way to solidify knowledge in your brain. But even if you aren’t learning new skills, it’s also important to maintain old ones. While Assembly is a language I’ll likely never have to use professionally in my life (and there’s even a low chance I’ll do it in my own projects), practicing any type of coding keeps the more general “programming skills” fresh.</p>
<p>That’s the thing: <em class="italic">specific</em> skills can be allowed to fade, but just the general knowledge of how to program, and how to write code, is something that you can’t allow to fade. And the best way I know to avoid that is to <a id="_idIndexMarker1098"/>always keep those juices flowing by always coding.</p>
<p>In the last chapter, I talked about personal projects and how games are an excellent choice that can keep your coding abilities strong and maybe even expand them. While I stand by games being a fantastic choice, it certainly isn’t the only choice. It almost doesn’t matter what you code, as long as you code <em class="italic">something</em>. Another possibility I like to suggest is a <strong class="bold">PIM</strong>, a <strong class="bold">personal information manager</strong>. This is an application that allows you to store, manage, and utilize important <a id="_idIndexMarker1099"/>pieces of personal information, usually things such as contacts, appointments, and notes. I like this idea so much, in fact, that I’ve used such a project in a good number of my books, as you can see in <em class="italic">Figure 12</em><em class="italic">.1</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 12.1: A montage of several of the PIM applications I’ve written over the years" src="img/B18315_12_01.jpg"/>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.1: A montage of several of the PIM applications I’ve written over the years</p>
<p>It’s a good choice because, like games, you’ll have to confront a lot of different programming topics, and they<a id="_idIndexMarker1100"/> can also be done with any technology. You can, of course, build it with React and Node, Angular and Java, or just plain HTML + CSS + JS with client-side data storage. Or, do it in Python and have a purely text-based interface. You can host it in a cloud provider if you like, or on your own home server. It works in any permutation of technologies and is challenging enough to keep your skills sharp while not being overly difficult.</p>
<p>But again, this is just one idea. Hopefully, you‘ve begun to realize that you like coding and building websites, solving problems, and all of what goes into it. If so, then finding ways to continually be coding, either working on one project or another, probably won‘t be so difficult. And again, none of it has to see the light of day! Nothing says you have to share your work with anyone else, or even use it after you write it. In fact, you don‘t necessarily even have to <em class="italic">finish</em> a project! My private source code repository is littered with aborted projects and ideas I dropped halfway through for one reason or another, and most developers are that way.</p>
<p>But you know what? I go back to those projects a lot because I realize that some part of it is still valuable. And even <a id="_idIndexMarker1101"/>though they weren’t completed, I gained experience in new technologies from them, experimented with new techniques and ideas, and just generally sharpened my skills as I worked on them, and that’s what ABC is all about.</p>
<p>Of course, writing code is only one part of keeping your skills sharp. Reading code is just as important, and there‘s a facility that I find a lot of developers forget or ignore these days, one I‘ve mentioned before but that is worth a second mention, and that‘s good ‘ole View Source.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-303"><a id="_idTextAnchor303"/>Viewing Source is your friend</h1>
<p>There’s a common<a id="_idIndexMarker1102"/> saying that, for a developer, <em class="italic">reading</em> code is just as important as writing code. In fact, many would say it’s <em class="italic">more</em> important. It’s also said that most developers spend more time reading code than writing code – whether it’s understanding an existing code base they must support, reading through their own code to remember how they did things, or reading the code of others for learning, it’s a skill all of its own.</p>
<p>Seeing how others have done things is an especially valuable exercise. To be sure, it isn’t always easy because you will inevitably run into things you don’t know, be it techniques, styles, new libraries, or what have you. It can be an exercise in frustration, but it’s too valuable to let that stop you.</p>
<p>Previously, I mentioned the View Source option, which has been a part of web browsers for decades now. This is something that developers sometimes forget is there! To some extent, that‘s because browser developer tools have mostly taken the place of View Source, but no matter how you do it specifically, I’m generically talking about the idea of looking at the work of others.</p>
<p>When you go to a website and see something cool, in most cases, you can use View Source or developer tools to examine the code. Now, this isn‘t quite as true as it used to be due to modern developer techniques. In the olden days of the late 90s/early 2000s, View Source was great because what you got was pure, untouched HTML, CSS, and JS. There was no mystery; it was all right there for you to examine and learn from.</p>
<p>That’s still true in the sense that HTML, CSS, and JS are the lingua franca of the web. No matter what developer tools, libraries, frameworks, or toolkits you use to build a website, it always boils down to HTML, CSS, and JS. There may be many different abstractions on top of the final code that the browser runs, but it still boils down to those three in the end.</p>
<p>But the final form that the browser<a id="_idIndexMarker1103"/> uses to display the web page can differ drastically nowadays from what the developer wrote owing to those abstractions. If they developed the web page with TypeScript, for example, the output code can sometimes look drastically different in its final JS form. Or, if they used Angular or React, then the code they wrote can look virtually nothing like what runs in the browser. There are also tools called <strong class="bold">obfuscators</strong>, which explicitly try <a id="_idIndexMarker1104"/>to make the code look as different as possible and explicitly more difficult to read. There are also compressors (called <strong class="bold">minifiers</strong>) that try to minimize the<a id="_idIndexMarker1105"/> size of the code in an attempt to make loading the page more efficient, but this too can make it harder to read. So, code is sometimes hard to read by accident, and sometimes on purpose, but it ultimately makes View Source less useful than it used to be.</p>
<p>Still, you can sometimes gain valuable insights even by looking at obfuscated code. Even if you can’t quite work out the exact code that is responsible for a given effect, for example, you may still be able to get a conceptual idea of how it’s done, which is often all you’re really after.</p>
<p>While modern code may be difficult to read, there are some things to be aware of that can help. The main one is something called <strong class="bold">source maps</strong>. These are special files that can be part of the output when compressing or<a id="_idIndexMarker1106"/> obfuscating JS, or when transpiling from TypeScript to JS, offering a way to map code within a file, as seen in the browser, back to its original source code. They enable a developer to examine code more easily by showing the original source code in a code viewer or debugger, even if the code running in the browser (or Node, or another runtime environment) is the minified or transpiled version. This mapping between the code at runtime and the original source code is crucial for debugging purposes and being able to learn from it.</p>
<p>Source maps are completely optional, unfortunately, so there‘s no guarantee they will be present. But when they are, what you wind up with is final code in a file named <code>example.min.js</code> that might look something like this:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
function a(a,b){return a+b}function s(a,b){return a-b}
//# sourceMappingURL=example.min.js.map</pre> <p>This can be used just as any JS file is in a <a id="_idIndexMarker1107"/>web page, as shown in the following simple HTML:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Example&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="img/example.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
      document.write(a(2, 2));
      document.write("&lt;br&gt;");
      document.write(s(10, 5));
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre> <p>It doesn’t really matter for this discussion, but so you’re not left hanging, <code>document.write()</code> is a function that writes content to the HTML document at whatever location it‘s at. So, in this case, it writes out the result of calling <code>a(2, 2)</code>, then a <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag to jump to the next line, and then the output of calling <code>s(10, 5)</code>.</p>
<p>Now, that JS code in <code>example.min.js</code> isn’t actually too bad to look at! You can tell from it that you have two functions, <code>a()</code> and <code>s()</code>, where <code>a()</code> adds two numbers, while <code>s()</code> subtracts two numbers (which is why you see 4 and 5 respectively written on the page). It’s rare with modern development tools that you’ll wind up with something that simple and easy to grasp.</p>
<p>But notice that second line, the one that is a comment. This is the magic sauce: it provides developer tools a link between this minified code and a source map file specific to <code>example.min.js</code>. The source map file might look something like this:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
{
  "version": 3,
  "file": "example.min.js",
  "sources": ["example.js"],
  "names": ["a", "s"],
  "mappings": "AAAA,SAASA,IAAT,GAAUA,EAAGA,QAAQC,IAAI,CAACC,CAAD,CAAK,CALZ,CAQA,IAAI,CAACC,CAAD,CAAK,EAAIC,CAAC"
}</pre> <p>Don’t worry about what any of that means because you, as a human-type person, aren’t generally expected to look at source map files directly. It’s not meant for us; it’s meant for tools. And when those tools<a id="_idIndexMarker1108"/> consume this file, the result is that in browser dev tools, you’ll now effectively have access to the original source file. That’s because the source map file knows how to, in a sense, translate from the minified version to the original source file, which is shown here:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
function a(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
function s(a, b) {
  return a – b;
}</pre> <p>In <em class="italic">Figure 12</em><em class="italic">.2</em>, you can see the list of files loaded for this example, which includes <code>example.js</code> (you can try this example by running <code>npx </code>http-server in the code directory for this chapter; it will start a server that you can then access using the URLs displayed, at which point you’ll be able to see the same thing in dev tools for yourself, as shown on these pages):</p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.2: An example of source maps in browser dev tools</p>
<p>This allows you to have the best of <a id="_idIndexMarker1109"/>both worlds! You can use all the fancy, new frameworks, libraries, and toolkits, and all the great minification/obfuscation tools you want, while still being able to effectively debug your live code. And it also allows others to still get value from your code as a learning experience.</p>
<p>It’s not just for learning about how others have done things, though, that View Source is so valuable. Another thing it allows you to do is to “think like a hacker” to find security vulnerabilities in your work.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-304"><a id="_idTextAnchor304"/>Thinking like a hacker</h2>
<p>What I mean by “think like a hacker” is the idea that you can use View Source, and browser developer tools in general, to put on your “white hat” and find vulnerabilities in your own code.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Types of hackers</p>
<p class="callout">Hackers – people <a id="_idIndexMarker1110"/>who examine websites and applications looking for security vulnerabilities – come in several varieties, typically denoted by “hat color.” White hat hackers, otherwise known as “ethical hackers,” are<a id="_idIndexMarker1111"/> those who operate legally and with the consent of a target with the express intent of finding and disclosing vulnerabilities. These people are often engaged by companies to find flaws in their sites. Black hats are those who use their skills for illegal or malicious purposes. Their motives frequently involve financial gain, espionage, or just to cause chaos. Grey hats fall somewhere in between, in that they look for vulnerabilities with the intent of disclosing them rather than exploiting them for nefarious purposes, but they do not operate with the consent or pre-knowledge of a target. Companies often have a love/hate relationship with grey hats because while it’s good for someone like that to find a problem and let the company know before the black hats do, it’s still rather disconcerting to get a report from someone unsolicited.</p>
<p>You have to change your mindset to do this, looking at the code not for what it is but for what you can do with it. Can you, for example, find a password embedded in the code that is used when calling your REST API? That’s a very obvious security problem; however, it won’t usually be that easy, so you’ll have to start coming at this sideways. Like, can you see a place where you might be able to hack the code to add some nefarious SQL to a server call – a SQL injection attack, in other words?</p>
<p>As long as it‘s your own code, this is all perfectly fine. But there‘s nothing to stop you from putting on your grey hat instead and looking at other people’s code too. As alluded to in the previous note box, you have to be careful about that because not every company will appreciate you doing so. But it can still be a learning experience for you because you can start to see patterns that you should avoid in your own work. Seeing the mistakes made by others is a valuable thing!</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to dig in and see how others have done things; whether for security purposes or not, that’s the bottom line. View Source is there for you to do so, as are the more advanced dev tools available in modern browsers. With them, you can learn a lot if you take the time to do so.</p>
<p>Another way you can enhance<a id="_idIndexMarker1112"/> your skills, as well as your employability, is certifications, those shiny pieces of (oftentimes virtual, nowadays) paper that purport to tell others what you know. Let‘s see what those are all about!</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-305"><a id="_idTextAnchor305"/>Certifying your greatness</h1>
<p>Certifications, those (sometimes) shiny <a id="_idIndexMarker1113"/>pieces of paper that (sometimes) hang on your wall, are a way to declare to the world “I know all about X!” where X is some technology or skill. They are like college degrees but without the need to sit in a classroom. You see, you can go take a test on, for example, web development, and if you pass, you’ll get a certification that is meant to say that you have attained a certain level of skill in web development.</p>
<p>There are hundreds if not thousands of certifications available. Some are administered by private companies (probably most of them are) on the specific technologies that are their primary source of income, some by government agencies, and some by organizations whose entire business model is providing certification exams. They cover all sorts of topics from cloud computing to cybersecurity, networking, AI and ML, data management and analysis, and project management.</p>
<p>Some certifications are free, but most cost money to get. How much? Anywhere from a few tens of dollars to thousands. Some are frankly very easy; the tests are fairly superficial and don’t require in-depth knowledge. Others – such as the networking tests administered by the company Cisco – are kind of notorious for being very difficult and requiring hands-on demonstrations of your skill.</p>
<p>But before you think about getting a certification of any kind, it’s worth asking a simple question: is it really worth the time, money, and effort?</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-306"><a id="_idTextAnchor306"/>Are they worth getting?</h2>
<p>People in the technology world <a id="_idIndexMarker1114"/>have historically had a bit of a love/hate relationship with certifications, and the thinking about them has changed over time. 20-30 years ago, almost any certification was worth something. They set you apart from the field when it came to getting hired because not everyone had them. At that time, spending a few hundred or even a few thousand dollars collecting a few certifications was a good way to help get your foot in the door, or perhaps help you get a raise or promotion.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it’s not quite so clear-cut. Some people put little stock in certifications at all because at the end of the day, if you’re someone who knows how to study and take tests, the thinking goes that you could conceivably get many certifications without having any actual experience in the topic you’re testing for.</p>
<p>To give a concrete example of that, nearly 25 years ago, I got a Novell administrator’s certification, where Novell is a long-gone operating system that used to be pretty popular in data centers. I knew the basics of Novell, sure, and I had a <em class="italic">little bit</em> of hands-on experience, but I was in <a id="_idIndexMarker1115"/>no way qualified to be an actual administrator of a real production Novell system. Despite that, I picked up a study book, read it cover to cover a time or two, and managed to pass the test because I’ve always been pretty good at regurgitating information for tests. So, effectively, that certification never really indicated my true level of knowledge about Novell; it much more just showed my ability to study and pass a test.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that’s how some people see <em class="italic">any</em> certification these days. But I think that’s unfair, because not all certifications are created equal. Some, like the Novell test, can be passed by someone with just basic knowledge and experience, but that would never have worked for one of the Cisco tests, for example. Those require you to really know your stuff and to be able to show it in practical ways.</p>
<p>As a general statement, certifications become less important over time because your past experience, in a sense, becomes your certification. If you’ve actually built one or more complex websites, then that shows me, as a hiring manager, what you know better than virtually any certification ever could.</p>
<p>So, it may sound like this is all a bit contradictory, and that’s because, in a sense, it is! There’s a tension here.</p>
<p>On the one hand, if you’re trying to get your first job and don’t have a lot of experience to show, then I would say there is some value in certifications. They won’t have the same value to every interviewer regardless, but for those who give them more weight, it may be the difference between getting hired and not. I would say, don’t spend an inordinate amount of time and money on them, though; look for the ones that (a) aren’t too expensive, and (b) you can pass based on what you <em class="italic">actually</em> know and without a huge investment of study time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as you build up some real work experience, my personal opinion – which I don’t believe I’m alone in – is to not put <em class="italic">as much</em> stock in certifications. It may still make sense to pursue one every now and again in a more targeted and focused way, such as if you are looking to switch positions and want to have as much evidence that you can do the new job<a id="_idIndexMarker1116"/> as possible. But “collecting certifications” – where you just keep getting them with the thought that it <em class="italic">may</em> be beneficial to your career generally – is probably a bit of wasted time, effort, and money. It’s probably better to spend the time building things to gain experience through doing, so you have more demonstrative evidence of your skills.</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, early in my career, I went through a phase of collecting certifications. At last count, I held something like 90 different certifications. While some, such as the Novell one, didn’t really reflect my knowledge and abilities at the time, a lot of them actually did. But either way, the simple fact is that they never had any tangible benefit to my career. They didn’t help me get my first job (I didn’t have any before then), nor did they help me get any big salary increase later (proving what I could do on the job very much did, though). Do I feel all that time and money was worth it? No, I honestly don’t. I think it’s true that I learned some things from the studying I did for them, though, so in that sense, I probably did get some benefit, but not enough to justify the time and money.</p>
<p>So, if you’re going to go for certifications at all, I think doing so surgically is the smart move; that’s the point of that anecdote.</p>
<p>Let’s say you decide to pursue certifications, whether to help get your first job or later on, for whatever reason. With so many certifications out there, how do you choose which to go after? Let’s look at some of the most popular ones these days and see what it takes to get them, and which are likely to have the most benefit to you.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-307"><a id="_idTextAnchor307"/>Specific certifications to pursue</h2>
<p>Knowing which certifications have more intrinsic worth to the greatest number of people is a very difficult task. Most of it comes down to opinion and subjective measures. Still, some generally do tend to float to the top when people discuss them. Here’s a list of the ones that appear to me – based on some online research – to be the most worth getting, broken down by category.</p>
<h3>General web development</h3>
<p>These are certifications that show skills in a variety of areas that a web developer might be expected to have some expertise in:</p>

<h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
<p>Cybersecurity is a critical topic these days, whether you’re looking for a job in cybersecurity directly or just want to <a id="_idIndexMarker1120"/>show that, as a web developer, you have a good grasp on this important topic:</p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic">Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)</em>: Administered by ISC2, it is an advanced-level certification for IT pros who are serious about careers in information security (<a href="https://www.isc2.org/certifications/cissp">https://www.isc2.org/certifications/cissp</a>)</li>
<li><em class="italic">Certified Information Security Manager (CISM)</em>: Administered by ISACA, it focuses on the management and governance of information security (<a href="https://www.isaca.org/credentialing/cism">https://www.isaca.org/credentialing/cism</a>)</li>
<li><em class="italic">Certified Web Application Security Tester (C-WAST)</em>: Administered by Udemy, an educational platform, it focuses on identifying and mitigating web application vulnerabilities (<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-web-application-tester/?couponCode=24T5FS31824">https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-web-application-tester/?couponCode=24T5FS31824</a>)</li>
<li><em class="italic">GIAC Web Application Penetration Tester (GWAPT)</em>: Administered by GIAC Certifications, it validates skills in web application security testing and penetration testing (<a href="https://www.giac.org/certifications/web-application-penetration-tester-gwapt">https://www.giac.org/certifications/web-application-penetration-tester-gwapt</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Networking</h3>
<p>As you know, networking is fundamental to being a web developer, and while these certifications aren’t ones I would <a id="_idIndexMarker1121"/>recommend for a web developer as they are far more advanced, they are nevertheless examples of certifications that would carry a lot of weight if attained:</p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic">Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)</em>: Administered by Cisco, it is an entry-level certification that covers basic networking concepts (<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/associate/ccna.html">https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/associate/ccna.html</a>)</li>
<li><em class="italic">Cisco Certified Network Professional (CCNP)</em>: Administered by Cisco, it covers more advanced networking topics, requiring a deeper knowledge and understanding of network solutions (<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/professional/ccnp-enterprise.html">https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/professional/ccnp-enterprise.html</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data management and analytics</h3>
<p>Dealing with data is a big part of <a id="_idIndexMarker1122"/>software development generally, so certifications that deal with those skills have a fair bit of intrinsic value:</p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic">Certified Data Professional (CDP)</em>: Administered by O*NET, a site for occupational information, it is a comprehensive certification program for data professionals (<a href="https://www.onetonline.org/link/certinfo/12605-B">https://www.onetonline.org/link/certinfo/12605-B</a>)</li>
<li><em class="italic">Microsoft Certified Data Analyst Associate</em>: Administered by Microsoft, it focuses on skills needed to transform, analyze, and visualize data in Microsoft Power BI (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/power-bi-data-analyst-associate">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/power-bi-data-analyst-associate</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Artificial intelligence and machine learning</h3>
<p>As you know, AI and ML are big and growing topics, so naturally, certifications in them will have some intrinsic meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic">Microsoft Certified Azure AI Engineer Associate</em>: Administered by Microsoft, it focuses on using cognitive services, ML, and knowledge mining to architect and implement Microsoft AI solutions (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-engineer">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-engineer</a>)</li>
<li><em class="italic">IBM Data Science Professional Certificate</em>: Administered by IBM and Coursera (a learning platform), this<a id="_idIndexMarker1123"/> certification covers data science, ML, and AI, using various tools and technologies (<a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science">https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Project management</h3>
<p>Like networking, these certifications <a id="_idIndexMarker1124"/>aren’t ones you would typically want to pursue as a web developer. But you know what? Some people eventually come to realize that they like the project management side of things more than the development side of things, so it’s good to know about certifications that might be of interest at that point, or just if you want to have a broader base of expertise generally:</p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic">Project Management Professional (PMP)</em>: Administered by PMI and recognized globally, it shows your competency to lead project teams and achieve project goals (<a href="https://www.pmi.org/certifications/project-management-pmp">https://www.pmi.org/certifications/project-management-pmp</a>)</li>
<li><em class="italic">Certified ScrumMaster (CSM)</em>: Administered by the Scrum Alliance, it focuses on Agile project management, particularly in software development, and how to act as a Scrum Master, the person who leads the daily standups and other aspects of an Agile project (<a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/get-certified/scrum-master-track/certified-scrummaster">https://www.scrumalliance.org/get-certified/scrum-master-track/certified-scrummaster</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I would say that attaining any of these certifications would look good on a resume, would be a benefit to helping get your first job, and might have some benefit to advancing your career later. I would definitely say that these – as of the time of this writing – will probably carry more weight with more people than most other certifications, so if you’re going to get any at all, these are the ones that I’d suggest should be at or near the top of your list.</p>
<p>So, you get some certifications, and you get your first job, and you know that you should Always Be Coding to keep your skills sharp. What else can you do to ensure and advance your career? It’s all about <a id="_idIndexMarker1125"/>keeping an eye on what’s going on in the industry and keeping an eye on what others are doing and learning as much from them as you can. Let’s talk about some strategies for doing that.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-308"><a id="_idTextAnchor308"/>Keeping up with the Joneses</h1>
<p>The IT field, and web development in particular, is an ever-changing, ever-expanding field that has new things to learn every time you turn around. Keeping pace with everything is practically a full-time job all on its own. We’ve spoken about several things over the last few chapters that you can use to keep up, such as meetups and conferences, but the good news is that the web itself provides a great many resources to do this from the comfort of your own home.</p>
<p>There are many websites out there that you can frequent to get the latest tech news, trends, opinions, and introductions to the latest and greatest on offer. Some are better than others, naturally, so trying to find the cream of the crop can be tricky. But never fear, that’s what I’m here for!</p>
<p>The following are some of the sites I personally find to provide the most value. No doubt, there are other good ones, but if you visit these often – and I personally like to glance at them on a nearly daily basis – I think you’ll do yourself a service and have a good feel for what’s going on in the industry. The importance of keeping an eye on the industry as a whole cannot be understated, as you gain a lot of insight about what others are doing and what technologies you should focus on, so it’s definitely a valuable use of your time, especially with good sites such as these.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-309"><a id="_idTextAnchor309"/>A List Apart</h2>
<p>A List Apart (<a href="https://alistapart.com">https://alistapart.com</a>) is a website that provides news specifically geared toward people – both designers and <a id="_idIndexMarker1126"/>developers – who make websites. It has a focus on web standards <a id="_idIndexMarker1127"/>and best practices in its articles, which makes it valuable for any web developer. On A List Apart, you’ll find topics ranging from coding to design, user experience, content strategies, and industry and process news.</p>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-310"><a id="_idTextAnchor310"/>Daily.dev</h2>
<p>Daily.dev (<a href="https://app.daily.dev">https://app.daily.dev</a>) is another “aggregator” site in that it provides links to the content of others in one easy-to-use, concise<a id="_idIndexMarker1128"/> interface. You’ll find a wide range of topics and article types, but <a id="_idIndexMarker1129"/>all with a focus on software development generally. Web development gets a lot of attention here, though not exclusively.</p>

<p>As a bonus, Daily.dev makes it easy <a id="_idIndexMarker1130"/>to submit content, so if the spirit moves you, this is a good site to introduce the world to any articles you may yourself write at some point!</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-311"><a id="_idTextAnchor311"/>dZone</h2>
<p>Over a million developers – as of the time of this writing – are members of dZone (<a href="https://dzone.com/">https://dzone.com/</a>), which means it’s a prominent<a id="_idIndexMarker1131"/> programming news hub for today’s professional developers. The site covers <a id="_idIndexMarker1132"/>everything from agile to cloud technologies, DevOps, big data, ML/Al, performance tuning, and more. It’s a valuable source for the latest insights from every corner of the industry and is good for both beginners and experienced developers alike.</p>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-312"><a id="_idTextAnchor312"/>Hacker News (Y Combinator)</h2>
<p>Hacker News, sometimes called Y Combinator (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">https://news.ycombinator.com</a>), is like Reddit but specifically for developers! Hacker News is one of the most well-known and respected sites for developer, technical, and science news. It’s a very sparse site that may not be the prettiest to look at, but is<a id="_idIndexMarker1133"/> very fast and easy to<a id="_idIndexMarker1134"/> navigate. It’s one of the best resources to keep up-to-date with and is frequently where industry discussions take place. For example, hundreds of developers got involved to discuss the massive AWS S3 outage on February 28, 2017, in real time. While some of its articles will be more theoretical and educational, others, such as that one, will turn into real-time discussions that anyone can read and take part in.</p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.6: Hacker News</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-313"><a id="_idTextAnchor313"/>InfoQ</h2>
<p>The tagline of InfoQ (<a href="https://www.infoq.com">https://www.infoq.com</a>) is “Facilitating the spread of knowledge and innovation in professional <a id="_idIndexMarker1135"/>software development,” and a glance at its home page shows that it takes that mantra seriously by providing a good cross-section of articles for you. While I <a id="_idIndexMarker1136"/>think I would say that InfoQ tends to skew a little bit toward more experienced developers, it does still have lower-level materials for other skill levels to get something from. It also has links to presentations and podcasts, many of which offer great value in exchange for some of your time.</p>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-314"><a id="_idTextAnchor314"/>SD Times</h2>
<p>SD Times (<a href="https://sdtimes.com">https://sdtimes.com</a>), short for Software<a id="_idIndexMarker1137"/> Development Times, is something of a digital newspaper made for developers of all kinds. Its content covers topics including <a id="_idIndexMarker1138"/>DevOps, testing, security, teams and culture, and system architecture. It offers news, of course, but in addition, also has webinars on specific topics, white papers, and podcasts. You may initially be fooled by the home page because it might look like there’s not all that much there, but scroll down a bit and explore the menus and you’ll find there’s actually quite a bit.</p>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-315"><a id="_idTextAnchor315"/>Technology Radar</h2>
<p>Finally, if you’re looking for a great graphical<a id="_idIndexMarker1139"/> representation of the emerging and hot technologies you should be looking at, Technology Radar (<a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar</a>) is a great choice. A product of Thoughtworks, which is a well-known technology consultancy, Technology <a id="_idIndexMarker1140"/>Radar shows you languages and frameworks, techniques, tools, and platforms, and whether you should – in the learned opinion – be holding up on using them (because they may be on their way out of developers’ minds), assessing whether they are appropriate for your use, putting them to use in a trial mode, or outright adopting them. In other words: it seeks to give you an idea of what technologies are hot right now, up and coming, or on their way out. Given the clearly opinionated nature of this site, you, of course, have to evaluate what it’s saying for yourself. But a well-known and generally well-respected group of people who definitely know their stuff providing this kind of guidance <a id="_idIndexMarker1141"/>can be a very valuable resource.</p>

<p>Reading news sites is of great value, something you pretty much <em class="italic">have</em> to do in this field. But something else you can do – and in my opinion <em class="italic">should</em> do whenever possible – is look for ways to put your skills to actual use to both build and demonstrate your abilities. While this has clear <a id="_idIndexMarker1142"/>benefits for you, it also has benefits for others, so it’s a win-win! Let’s see some ways you can accomplish this now.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-316"><a id="_idTextAnchor316"/>Giving back to get back</h1>
<p>Over my many years as a developer/architect/lead/technical manager, one thing that I’ve come to understand is that when you help others, you almost always wind up helping yourself in the process. This comes in many forms. Helping a coworker with a problem often leads to you gaining insights you didn’t have before. Teaching others helps solidify knowledge in your own mind. And when you contribute to projects, you gain a sense of accomplishment on top of whatever technical benefits you also get.</p>
<p>Therefore, I always look for ways I can “give back” to others. I say give back because we all depend on others, whether they taught us, helped us through problems, or simply created software and tools that we depend on. Looking for opportunities to do the same thing yourself is a great way to build your skillset and other intangible qualities too.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about some ways you might look to give back. Which way works for you is something you, of course, need to discover for yourself, and this is by no means an exhaustive list. But hopefully, it gives you some ideas going forward on things you might do.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-317"><a id="_idTextAnchor317"/>Open source contributions</h2>
<p>One of the best – and also one of the easiest – ways to give back is to contribute to open-source projects (the abbreviation <strong class="bold">FOSS</strong>, short for <strong class="bold">free/open-source software</strong>, is typically used, and I will do so here). You can, of course, start your own; there’s nothing wrong with<a id="_idIndexMarker1143"/> that and it has a lot <a id="_idIndexMarker1144"/>of benefits. But here, I’m focusing on finding projects you like and contributing to them.</p>
<p>A lot of developers are nervous about getting involved in projects, especially early on in their own learning, because they figure there’s nothing they could possibly contribute. Let me assure you that this is wrong! FOSS projects are often in need of people doing things that don’t require a high level of technical skill. For example, documentation is something that a lot of projects are lacking and that the maintainers of projects are all too happy to have people help with.</p>
<p>In fact, your relative inexperience could actually be a blessing: writing simpler “introductory” documentation, as someone new to using a project would need, is something you can probably handle since you would have to go through that learning process yourself to be able to write such documentation. You may well save others time getting up to speed with such a contribution, which is for sure a valuable thing.</p>
<p>There’s no permission to get – you just start writing! You’ll likely need to clone the project’s repo, as was discussed in <a href="B18315_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor105"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>. That gives you a local copy on your own machine that you can then start hacking at without any risk to the existing project’s code. If things don’t go well, it’s no big deal; you can always clone a fresh copy and start again, no harm no foul.</p>
<p>But eventually, when you’ve made good progress, you can send a pull request (assuming the project is using GitHub) when you believe the documentation is ready. To be sure, there’s no guarantee it <a id="_idIndexMarker1145"/>will be accepted, or that there won’t be comments sent back about things they’d like to see. But very often, you’ll get a great, big “thank you!” and an immediate acceptance.</p>
<p>Looking at the existing bugs for a project and submitting fixes is another great way to contribute. It’s obviously great for the project to get bugs resolved, but it’s fantastic for you too because not only does it help you learn the code base of the project so you can contribute more in the future, but it means you’re reading code and learning from it, so selfishly, it’s going to benefit you greatly. And you don’t need to tackle the trickiest bugs right off the bat! Finding ones that appear to be on the simpler side, even “silly” things such as maybe a label on a screen having a spelling mistake, can get your foot in the door.</p>
<p>Eventually, you can look at a project and think “Okay, what feature could I add that I think people would like?” and go for it. When you get to this point, you may want to have some discussions on a message forum or mailing list of Discord – however the project members communicate – to get some level of buy-in so you don’t wind up wasting a lot of time on something that ultimately won’t have a chance of being accepted (then again, just the experience of building the feature can benefit you, so keep that in mind too). It’s also good to know you won’t start working on something that a project member is already working on.</p>
<p>Maybe the website of the project is a bit lacking. In such a case, you might offer to build something a bit more robust. Things are a little different in this regard than they used to be because most FOSS projects are hosted on sites such as GitHub, and they may not have their own unique website, as was most common years ago. But it’s still the case that projects will often want to have their own “face,” so to speak, even if they’re hosted on GitHub, and offering to build that – and maybe offering up some design ideas or prototypes to make the <a id="_idIndexMarker1146"/>case – can be something that will be valued too.</p>
<p>You can also often get involved in FOSS projects just by becoming an <strong class="bold">SME</strong>, or <strong class="bold">subject matter expert</strong>. If you get to know a project<a id="_idIndexMarker1147"/> well, you can begin to help people on message forums who are having problems. That’s a contribution that will be appreciated not only by the users of the project but also by the maintainers, since they can then focus more on writing code than helping people.</p>
<p>FOSS is all about community at the end of the day, so finding ways you can help the community is what it’s all about. Whether that means documentation, coding, or just answering questions, it all counts.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-318"><a id="_idTextAnchor318"/>Presentations</h2>
<p>Another way to give back is to give<a id="_idIndexMarker1148"/> presentations at events such as user groups and meetups. This will help you solidify your technical knowledge because, of course, you’ll need to study and learn to create your presentation and to be prepared for questions. But this also has the benefit of getting you experience in speaking to a crowd, which is a valuable skill to have.</p>
<p>All you really need to do is choose a topic you’re confident about and find a suitable group to present to. The website <a href="http://meetup.com">meetup.com</a> is a great resource for this. You’ll likely want to start small, so find smaller, local groups that deal with the topic you want to present, and simply contact the organizers. Those folks are usually quite receptive to someone wanting to give a presentation because otherwise, they have to put in effort to find people themselves. It’s always good to make peoples’ jobs easier!</p>
<p>If you’ve never given a presentation before, it will be quite nerve-racking at first. Speaking in front of a crowd, whether large or small, is something that frightens people. As with most things, the more you do it, the more comfortable with it you’ll become, so I say, jump in with both feet! Face the nerves and fight through them!</p>
<p>That said, how do you give a good presentation? Some general guidelines can help you do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assuming you have a slide deck built in something such as Microsoft PowerPoint, have just one topic per slide. You want to be sure you don’t overload your audience <a id="_idIndexMarker1149"/>with too much information at once, and overly dense slides do just that.</li>
<li>Show, don’t just tell. This is as good advice for presentations as it is for fiction writing. If you can show the results of a bit of code, then do so, rather than simply telling your audience what it will do.</li>
<li>Don’t simply read your slides! This is a very common problem, and it gets noticed quickly. Your audience can read the slide just fine on their own; your job is to expand on what’s there as they read it.</li>
<li>Going hand-in-hand with the previous point: limit each slide to one or maybe two sentences. Again, overly-dense slides just split the audience’s attention. They’re there to hear you speak, not read a bunch of text. One or two sentences that frame what you’re saying are all you need.</li>
<li>Each slide should account for a minute or two of time, generally speaking. Presentations, such as stories, should keep moving at a decent pace. There will, of course, be exceptions, but keeping things moving at this rate is a good general guideline.</li>
<li>Use graphics when possible. As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words. A good image, graph, or screenshot can tell a story better than a bunch of words, whether printed or spoken (well, sometimes – each instance has to be examined on its own merits – but it’s a good guideline generally).</li>
<li>If possible, have one or two “WOW!” moments in your presentation. This might be near the end where you put everything you’ve said together in some way, or it might be right at the start where you demonstrate something impressive that you’ll be discussing. Or it may be one or two moments in between. In any case, it’s a great way to get and keep your audience engaged and feeling like they are spending their time well.</li>
</ul>
<p>And, of course, practice! Many people like to present in a mirror; others prefer to get their significant other to listen to them. There are even <a id="_idIndexMarker1150"/>places online where you can practice in front of “people,” even in VR! One such site is <a href="https://virtualorator.com">https://virtualorator.com</a>, which allows you to practice in a simulated environment that is very similar to the real thing, assuming you have the appropriate VR equipment.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-319"><a id="_idTextAnchor319"/>Blogging</h2>
<p>Something else you can do is write independent articles – blogging, as we call it today. Sites such as <a href="http://medium.com">medium.com</a> make this very easy to do and can potentially earn you some money in the process.</p>
<p>Getting started is as easy as signing up for an account, and then starting to type! You’ll need to do all the appropriate research on<a id="_idIndexMarker1151"/> whatever topic you’re writing about, create examples if appropriate, and learn to edit and review your work before publishing. But there’s no real barrier to entry other than your own drive and motivation.</p>
<p>Medium isn’t the only such site, nor do you even have to use such a site. You can instead self-host your articles, perhaps using something such as WordPress, or just creating your own site from scratch, which has the bonus of showing off what you can do. The big difference is that using a site such as Medium will likely get your work in front of more people faster because technical readers congregate there, in a sense, whereas if it’s your own site, you’ll need to get into advertising and awareness yourself. You could start on Medium and build a bit of an audience who knows your work and then migrate to your own site as well.</p>
<p>When writing such articles, a few things to remember are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s inevitable, no matter how well you think you’ve done, that <em class="italic">someone</em> is going to criticize your work. It’s just the reality of the world we live in. So, be ready for it when it comes, grow a thick skin, and see whether there’s anything of value in the criticism. There could be a nugget of truth wrapped in some unkind words that you can get some benefit from if you can find it (of course, there will always be a few people who are just mean for the sake of being mean, so you’ll need to learn how and when to simply ignore people too).</li>
<li>Remember that your articles don’t necessarily need to be huge and grandiose to bring value to people. Sometimes, just a few paragraphs might be all someone needs to have a “eureka!” moment, and they’ll thank you for it just as much as if you had written a full-length book.</li>
<li>Choose topics that <a id="_idIndexMarker1152"/>you’re passionate about. People can usually tell when a writer is just going through the motions or when they are actually excited about what they’re writing about. Be the latter, because it always comes across better.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-320"><a id="_idTextAnchor320"/>Technical reviewer for authors</h2>
<p>Another way you can give back is to be a technical reviewer of books such as this one!</p>
<p>Whenever an author writes a technical book, they need people to go over it and keep them honest, making sure they haven’t made any technical mistakes. Writing a book ain’t easy, believe me, and no matter <a id="_idIndexMarker1153"/>how hard you try, there’s usually something that doesn’t work right. Maybe there are differences across operating systems you didn’t know about. Maybe there are different versions of libraries that you didn’t use when writing the example code that breaks those examples. Maybe you simply didn’t explain something as clearly as you thought you did. All of this is where technical reviewers come into play.</p>
<p>Being a technical reviewer requires you to read, test, and look for problems that readers might encounter. Sometimes, you’ll have to be an expert yourself in the topic the book is about, but often, it can almost be better if you aren’t. That’s because it’s logical to think that most technical books are being read by people who are trying to learn, not by those who are already experts in a given topic. Given that supposition, it therefore makes sense that a technical reviewer might not be either (though, certainly, you would always be expected to have <em class="italic">some</em> knowledge going in – it largely comes down to how a given publisher approaches things).</p>
<p>How do you get a gig as a technical reviewer? Well, there are essentially three ways. One is that you can be someone who is found and approached. For example, if you’ve written a bunch of articles on React, then a publisher working on a React book might notice you and approach you, recognizing that you’re someone who knows their stuff. Another way is to know the author. Authors are often asked whether they know anyone who could serve as a technical reviewer, so if you have a strong network then you may get asked by people you are acquainted with who are writing books. The third way is to simply approach a publisher! Go to their website and look for contact links for editors, or maybe acquisition people, and send them a note saying you’re interested in being a technical reviewer. You might not hit paydirt right away, but you also may find your name added to a list that gets you contacted later on.</p>
<p>I’ll give you a bonus fourth<a id="_idIndexMarker1154"/> way, too: read existing books, look for mistakes, and send error data to the publisher. Not only will you hone your technical reviewer skills and help authors and publishers, but you might get noticed if you submit many, and that could lead to opportunities later.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-321"><a id="_idTextAnchor321"/>Writing books yourself</h2>
<p>Of course, you may, at some point, move beyond being a blogger or technical reviewer and decide that writing a book yourself might be something you want to do.</p>
<p>Publishers such as Packt are pretty receptive to new authors, so if it’s something you think you might want to do then definitely give it a shot. You may even get approached by a publisher at some point if they see your writing out there already, but you can always approach them yourself. Most if not all publishers have links on their sites that direct you on how to submit book proposals to them. Typically, that involves submitting some overview information about what you want to write, and often, they’ll want a rough outline that shows what the book will be like too.</p>
<p>It’s kind of like fishing, really: you drop some bait in the water in the form of your proposal, and then wait for a bite! Once it comes, then the hard work begins!</p>
<p>And while it’s a lot of hard work, it has big benefits for you. For starters, learning and practicing how to explain yourself clearly is one, given that’s a key requirement of any book. Another benefit is that as an author, there’s an expectation that you know the material you write about well, but since no one knows it all, you may have to do some research and learn about it as you go.</p>
<p>And, having on your resume that you wrote a book or two doesn’t look half-bad!</p>
<p>Plus, should you wind up writing a hit book, there can be some very nice financial benefits too. The publishing industry has gotten a bit tougher since the internet became what it is today, but people do still read and even often prefer books, so there can still be gold in them thar hills. But even if you don’t get rich writing a book, the benefits you get from it aside from money can make it a worthwhile experience. Just keep in mind that it’s going to be a lot of hard work, so be prepared for that going in. But as long as you are, go for it, I say!</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-322"><a id="_idTextAnchor322"/>Mentoring</h2>
<p>The final way you can give back is to become a mentor. I focus more on being a mentor because being a teacher usually requires standardized certifications, degrees, and other accreditations. Being a mentor, however, normally doesn’t.</p>
<p>Who can you mentor? Well, it can really be anyone, but one good possibility is older folks around your town. Perhaps there is a senior center near you, or an active center for older adults. These types of places <a id="_idIndexMarker1155"/>sometimes have night sessions for people who want to learn technical skills. Now, there may not be quite as much call for web development learning there, but you never know! And even if there’s not, teaching people how to use computers generally, and how to use the World Wide Web, can be very valuable to them and help you ensure you know your basics too.</p>
<p>Another way you can sometimes get into mentoring is to frequent online social sites where people are discussing web development and look for people who are themselves looking for help. Sometimes, you’ll see someone outright asking for a mentor, someone to guide them in their learning. Jump in and offer to help them!</p>
<p>There are also some sites specific to finding and being mentors. One example is <a href="http://mentorcruise.com">mentorcruise.com</a>. While you can become a mentor on this site and earn some money, that will oftentimes be a secondary concern to simply helping people. Being a mentor is a time commitment, though, so you have to make sure you’re ready for that. That might entail a lot of time or not very much at all; it simply depends on the arrangement you make.</p>
<p>The overarching message of this section is that you help yourself in various ways when you help others. Yes, that might be in the form of additional income, but that’s not really what it’s all about. It’s really about the positive feelings you get from helping others, and the benefits to your skills and knowledge that come from helping others with theirs.</p>
<p>But regardless of whether you choose to mentor or not, it’s all probably driving toward building your career over time, advancing yourself through various positions as you grow. Let’s talk about some of the positions you might aspire to.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-323"><a id="_idTextAnchor323"/>Advanced positions to aspire to</h1>
<p>To be a web developer is, on its own, a fine goal. And you may find it to be completely rewarding and fulfilling. I had a manager many years ago who willingly took a pay <em class="italic">cut</em> just so he could go back to being just a programmer because he loved that part of his job but discovered he really hated the management part of it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some people find out that they enjoy managing people, directing projects, and doing all the sorts of things that managers<a id="_idIndexMarker1156"/> and higher-ups typically do. And there may come a time when you’re looking around, having been a web developer for a while, and you start to think, “I might be ready for new challenges.”</p>
<p>Fortunately, web developers can progress through several advanced stages in their career if they want to, all the way up to executive positions such as chief information officer. To give you an idea of the types of jobs you might wind up doing in your potential career progression, let’s look at some of the most common titles you might encounter.</p>
<p>To be clear, there is no definitive guide to getting ahead in this field (or really any other!). But given what is generally known about the various roles and what they require, we can put together some general advice that should help you get to each new role.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-324"><a id="_idTextAnchor324"/>Senior developer</h2>
<p>After gaining enough practical <a id="_idIndexMarker1157"/>experience, a web developer can advance to a senior role where they’ll focus on more complex projects, as well as start to become a mentor to junior developers and generally lead development efforts from a technical perspective.</p>
<p>Requirements of this role might include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>More advanced programming skills in various languages and frameworks</li>
<li>A strong understanding of software development methodologies and be able to apply them</li>
<li>Experience with the tools of the trade outside of programming, such as database management and performance optimization, is a must</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the actions to take to advance to this role might include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start to mentor junior developers in order to demonstrate your leadership and communication skills. Look for opportunities where you can help people.</li>
<li>Take on more complex tasks to showcase your problem-solving and project management abilities. When a challenging part of a system comes up, raise your hand to do it and then take control of the effort.</li>
<li>Demonstrate continuous learning of new technologies to stay current and increase value to the organization. When decisions are being made about how to do things, bring new ideas <a id="_idIndexMarker1158"/>and technologies to the table <em class="italic">where they </em><em class="italic">make sense</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-325"><a id="_idTextAnchor325"/>Technical lead</h2>
<p>In this role, you would be responsible for overseeing the technical aspects of projects over a wide range of concerns, ensuring<a id="_idIndexMarker1159"/> that the development team meets the project’s technical requirements and standards. You would also, at this point, act as something of a bridge between the development team and management. The difference between a senior developer and a lead developer is often razor-thin and, commonly, only one of these roles might exist in a given organization.</p>
<p>Requirements of this role might include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proven experience in leading development projects in a senior role</li>
<li>Demonstrated problem-solving, technical, and team management skills over the course of several projects</li>
<li>The ability to translate business requirements into technical solutions is necessary</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the actions to take to advance to this role might include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work to show that you can work across departments, communicating with other teams to facilitate smoother project execution. Showing you can put all the pieces together is key.</li>
<li>Advocate for best practices in code quality, testing, and maintainability. Be a leader in enhancing the quality of the projects you work on.</li>
<li>Manage project timelines and deliverables effectively to show organizational capabilities. You don’t need to be a project manager yourself, but you do need to work hand-in-hand <a id="_idIndexMarker1160"/>with project managers and help organize the projects you are both working on to show you can perform those duties.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-326"><a id="_idTextAnchor326"/>Architect</h2>
<p>Architects, whether software, web, or system <a id="_idIndexMarker1161"/>architects, are responsible for the design and overall architecture of a project, focusing on concerns such as scalability, security, and integration with other systems. They make high-level design choices and set technical standards including the tooling to be used, the platform to be built on, and the coding standards to be adhered to. This is the point where, usually, you stop coding on a daily basis, though many architects still find some time to code a little bit, but you’ll spend more time on things such as diagrams, documentation, and meetings.</p>
<p>Requirements of this role might include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A deep understanding of system design, architecture patterns, and best practices</li>
<li>Experience in designing scalable, secure, and robust systems will be needed, demonstrated across several projects</li>
<li>Knowledge of various architectural styles, frameworks, and other foundational technologies that projects are built on</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the actions to take to advance to this role might include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design and implement systems that align with business goals, proving strategic thinking. When working on projects, look for opportunities where you can make suggestions for things that will proactively make the business stakeholders happy, solving problems they may not even realize they have.</li>
<li>Lead architectural reviews and decision-making processes. Get yourself involved in the meetings where the decisions are made and don’t be afraid to speak up!</li>
<li>Contribute to the technology roadmap and innovation strategies of the organization. Showing <a id="_idIndexMarker1162"/>that you understand the business and what it needs from technology is what it’s all about.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-327"><a id="_idTextAnchor327"/>Development manager</h2>
<p>This is usually the first purely management role a developer reaches and involves overseeing multiple development teams, managing<a id="_idIndexMarker1163"/> budgets, and ensuring project timelines are met. Development managers handle the technical and personnel management of their teams, but they rely on others to deal with a lot of the day-to-day technical details. It’s critical, though, that a development manager has a good technical foundation to be able to communicate effectively with their teams.</p>
<p>Requirements of this role might include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strong, demonstrated leadership, and effective people management skills</li>
<li>Budgeting and resource allocation experience</li>
<li>Proficiency in project management methodologies and tools</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the actions to take to advance to this role might include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop and mentor teams to build a strong department. Look for opportunities where you can suggest ways to reorganize teams to be more effective.</li>
<li>Cultivate relationships with other departments to align development efforts with business needs. Yes, we’re effectively talking about networking here, because having a web of people you can call upon and work well with shows you’re ready for this role.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-328"><a id="_idTextAnchor328"/>Director of engineering</h2>
<p>At this level, a person oversees all engineering or <a id="_idIndexMarker1164"/>development activities within an organization, sets the strategic direction for the development department, and works closely with other executives to align technical projects with business goals. This isn’t quite considered an executive-level position usually, but someone in this role will definitely spend a lot of time talking to executives.</p>
<p>Requirements of this role might include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strategic planning and execution skills</li>
<li>Extensive experience in managing large and diverse technology teams</li>
<li>A strong and deep understanding of the core business and an ability to align technology with company aims</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the actions to take to <a id="_idIndexMarker1165"/>advance to this role might include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop long-term technology strategies that support business goals. This shows that you are thinking at a high level, in a global sense, about the entire business and what it does.</li>
<li>Foster innovation and continuous improvement in technology practices. You’ll need to not only make suggestions but push to make things happen every chance you get.</li>
<li>Manage stakeholder relationships and communicate technology strategy effectively. This means ensuring everyone is happy and pulling in the same direction across the business and technology people.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-329"><a id="_idTextAnchor329"/>Vice president of technology</h2>
<p>The VP of technology has a broader role that <a id="_idIndexMarker1166"/>may encompass several departments, areas of technology, or lines of business. This role requires leading large teams and being responsible for the technological direction and vision of the company. Here, you’re definitely out of the technology game in terms of implementing anything yourself. Instead, you’re deciding what large groups of people will do.</p>
<p>Requirements of this role might include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experience in a senior technology leadership role (there are no two ways about it)</li>
<li>A deep understanding of not only the business but also the industry and market trends the business operates in</li>
<li>The ability to lead large-scale technology initiatives and transformations over a long period of time</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the actions to take to<a id="_idIndexMarker1167"/> advance to this role might include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drive technology vision and ensure it integrates with the overall business strategy. You’re the idea person at this point, the one who people look to when deciding what resources should go toward.</li>
<li>Lead and inspire large technology teams across different areas. You’re not just a figurehead, but inspiring people is part of the gig!</li>
<li>Establish strong governance and processes for technology management. Things such as regulatory concerns become a big part of your job at that point, depending on the industry.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-330"><a id="_idTextAnchor330"/>Chief technology officer (CTO)</h2>
<p>This is our first entry into the C-suite, which is the colloquialism given to anyone with a title beginning with chief, or C. They are<a id="_idIndexMarker1168"/> one of the executives of a company. The CTO is responsible for the technological roadmap of the company, focusing on integrating new technologies, overseeing the engineering department, and making decisions that align with the company’s strategic goals. This is, in some ways, more of a business role than a technology role, though the overall size of the organization is a big factor into what degree this is the case.</p>
<p>Requirements of this role might include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A track record of innovative, technological solutions</li>
<li>Strong business and technology strategic planning</li>
<li>Experience in leading technology at a strategic level</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the actions to take to<a id="_idIndexMarker1169"/> advance to this role might include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work to define and drive the company’s technological agenda to foster innovation and growth. It’s big-vision time here, with goals that will affect the entire company.</li>
<li>Build and maintain high-level relationships with partners, vendors, and industry leaders. In a sense, an executive position such as CTO is all about relationships, both inside the company and without.</li>
<li>Ensure the alignment of technology functions with business goals at a high level. Anything that doesn’t advance the overall goals of the company is something you should work to fix.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-331"><a id="_idTextAnchor331"/>Chief information officer (CIO)</h2>
<p>As compared to a CTO, the CIO definitely has a more business-oriented focus. They manage the organization’s IT infrastructure <a id="_idIndexMarker1170"/>at large, and the services provided to support business goals. The CIO is involved in strategic planning at a global level, determines investments in technology, and ensures that the company’s technology infrastructure supports its overall business objectives.</p>
<p>Requirements of this role might include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extensive experience in IT management and strategic planning</li>
<li>A deep understanding of how technology affects various aspects of the business</li>
<li>Strong leadership skills, financial knowledge, and strategic business planning skills</li>
</ul>
<p>Actions to take to advance to this role include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oversee the company’s technological infrastructure to ensure it meets strategic business objectives. You’ll most likely be at a CTO level at this point, so it’s really a question of doing well in that role.</li>
<li>Develop and implement IT policies and systems that align with corporate goals. You’re truly driving the boat now, so you have to have a good vision of how things should be and push everyone below you to implement it.</li>
<li>Lead digital transformation initiatives and manage the organization’s IT investments. Look for opportunities where you can drastically change the way things are done from a technological perspective and transform them (when it makes sense, of course – don’t just do things for the sake of doing things!).</li>
</ul>
<p>Transitioning through these<a id="_idIndexMarker1171"/> roles demands an evolving blend of technical expertise, leadership skills, strategic thinking, and a deep understanding of both technology and business, more so the higher up the ladder you go. Networking, continuous learning, and gaining experience in various aspects of technology and management are essential for advancing to these higher-level positions, as are solid communication and interpersonal skills.</p>
<p>Note that these titles may not be the same in every organization, and some may not exist at all, while there may be others that aren’t shown here. But these are fairly typical and should provide a good idea of the progression you might experience.</p>
<p>To advance through these jobs, you must not only excel in technical abilities but also develop strong leadership, strategic thinking, and business skills. Networking, pursuing ongoing education opportunities, and staying on top of industry changes also play a critical role in navigating the career path from web developer to CIO.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-332"><a id="_idTextAnchor332"/>Reviewing the roadmap</h1>
<p>That’s it! You did it! You’ve uncovered <a id="_idIndexMarker1172"/>all the squares, as Figure <em class="italic">12</em><em class="italic">.10</em> shows:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 12.10: ﻿The roadmap, now completed" src="img/B18315_12_10_NEW.jpg"/>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.10: The roadmap, now completed</p>
<p>The last three – <strong class="bold">Ongoing Growth</strong>, <strong class="bold">Open Source Contributions</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Certifications</strong> – close out the roadmap. You<a id="_idIndexMarker1173"/> can now see all the elements that go into being a modern-day web developer, and all the skills and abilities you need to cultivate to have a gainful career in this industry. Congratulations! It was a long journey, but a fruitful one!</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-333"><a id="_idTextAnchor333"/>Summary</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we looked at some ways you can work to advance your career. We discussed how the idea of ABC – Always Be Coding – is key to keeping your skills sharp and fresh. We talked about how certifications may (or may not) have value in convincing people of your knowledge. We also looked at some websites you can frequent to keep you up-to-date on all the latest industry news and happenings.</p>
<p>We discussed ways you can “give back” by helping others while, in the process, helping yourself learn and stay sharp. Finally, we looked at some of the career goals you may have, roles you might aspire to, what’s required of them, and (some of) what it takes to achieve them.</p>
<p>Whew – and that’s it, dear reader, you did it! You finished the entire book! I hope, at this point, you have a clear picture of what is required of you as an aspiring web developer, and I hope I’ve been able to build with you a solid foundation of knowledge from which you can build a successful career. Most of all, I hope I’ve at least helped develop in you a feeling of “Hey, this could actually be fun and fulfilling!” because I believe that can be the case if you decide this is a path for you.</p>
<p>Good luck in your journey, and I hope to see you as a colleague down the road!</p>
