    you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, making it a popular choice
    for server-side and command-line applications. Understanding these fundamentals
    of Node.js will provide you with a solid foundation for developing server-side
    applications, command-line tools, and other JavaScript-based solutions using the
    Node.js runtime.

    To learn how to develop with the Node.js framework, you need to master its building
    blocks and key concepts. One thing is for sure: Node.js is a framework with which
    you can build even the most difficult projects. You can build REST APIs, authorization
    systems, data visualization and management systems/applications, frontend frameworks
    with templating languages, AI and machine learning apps, and many more.'

    In synchronous programming, tasks are executed sequentially, one after the other.
    When a function is called, the program waits until that function completes its
    execution before moving on to the next task. This means that each operation must
    finish before the next one starts. In a synchronous process, if an operation takes
    a long time to complete (such as reading data from a database or making a network
    request), it can block the entire program, making it unresponsive. In asynchronous
    programming, tasks are executed independently from the main program flow. When
    an asynchronous operation is initiated, the program can continue executing other
    tasks without waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete. Once the asynchronous
    operation finishes, a callback function or a promise resolves, allowing the program
    to handle the result.

    and server-side JavaScript frameworks, contributing to the rapid growth of JavaScript-based
    applications and services on the web.

    to complete tasks. **Asynchronous and non-blocking communication** refers to the
    practice of allowing services to continue their operations without waiting for
    immediate responses from other services.

    a synchronized manner. The sender sends a request and waits until it receives
    a response before proceeding with further actions. This communication style is
    similar to making a phone call: you wait for the other person to answer and respond
    before you continue the conversation. In asynchronous communication, the sender
    and receiver operate independently. The sender sends a request and continues with
    other tasks without waiting for a response. When the receiver processes the request
    and generates a response, it is sent back to the sender. This style of communication
    is similar to sending an email: you send the message and continue with your work,

- en: '**Microservices architecture** is a software development approach where a complex
    application is broken down into smaller, independent services that can be developed,
    deployed, and maintained separately. Each microservice focuses on a specific business
    capability and communicates with other microservices through well-defined APIs.
    This architectural style offers several benefits but also requires careful design
    and management.'

- en: In a microservices architecture, services communicate through APIs, enabling
    them to work together seamlessly while remaining loosely coupled. Meanwhile, in
    a serverless architecture, functions are often triggered by events, and APIs are
    used to pass data between functions and external services.

    APIs are interconnected concepts that enable developers to build scalable, modular,
    and efficient applications. By combining these approaches, developers can create
    flexible and resilient systems that meet the demands of modern software development.
