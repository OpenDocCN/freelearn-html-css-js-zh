In fact, HTML5 is the first version of HTML to get its own logo (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.w3.org/html/logo">http://www.w3.org/html/logo</a>). To understand the significance of that, one must first know a little history.</p><div><img src="img/5869_00_01.jpg" alt="Preface"/></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>A brief history of time (client-server edition)</h1></div></div></div><p>Enterprise application development over the decades has been a pendulum swinging back and forth between terminal and mainframe, between client and server. In the 1980s, business logic was largely pushed to the server by "dumb terminals" or "thin clients" which did very little except act as a middleman between the user and the server. Beginning in the 1990s, logic started to swing to the client with "fat clients" bearing the processing burden. With the introduction of the World Wide Web in 1991, a new breed of thin client emerged. The pendulum swung once again. Or did it?</p><p>The shift between client and server has largely been driven by cost and power. Early on, investment was made in powerful, costly servers. As PCs became more powerful in terms of memory and processing ability, as well as lower in cost, it became possible to build applications that could be distributed more easily, allow for offline capabilities, and best of all require less powerful (and less costly) server infrastructures. However, maintaining, upgrading, and deploying "fat clients" created a new burden.</p><p>Web-based applications eventually emerged to solve the problems of cost, power, and maintainability. At first, they appeared to be much like their "thin client" predecessors: merely middlemen between users and servers but without the deployment overhead. However, with the introduction of technologies such as Java and JavaScript, the "thin client" began to put on a little weight. Before long, the processing burden began to bleed to the client as applets, scripts, and plugins became more commonplace and with them the maintainability problem reappeared. Rather than managing distributions of applications, the problem shifted to managing distributions of applets, scripts, and plugins.</p><p>The situation was bifurcated by the introduction of "rich clients". Business logic became tiered. A separation of concerns became the norm. Let the server deal with server stuff. Let the client deal with client stuff. The problem with this, however, is that the client took some time to be able to handle the client stuff the world needed of it.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>A brief history of time (web browser edition)</h1></div></div></div><p>When Tim Berners-Lee introduced his World Wide Web browser to his CERN colleagues in 1990, only a glimmer could be seen of what it would one day become. Marc Andreessen would introduce Mosaic and graphical browsing in 1993 and Netscape would soon follow in 1994. After that, Microsoft jumped in with Internet Explorer in 1995. Pretty soon, the first browser wars would come and go with Internet Explorer emerging as the victor and the remnants of Netscape coalescing around Mozilla and Firefox, which was released in 2002. In the 2000s, Apple released Safari and Google released Chrome.</p><p>Web browsers however have seldom held parity with one another. The existence of web standards and a governing body called the W3C notwithstanding, browser makers have nevertheless played to their own tunes. In the beginning, implementations of HTML varied widely and the trend continued through HTML 4.0, XHTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The variance in implementations and behavior made web development difficult and time consuming.</p><p>To combat the limitations and inconsistencies of the web browser, technologies based on plugins such as Adobe Flash began to flourish continuing where browser-based technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript left off. For years, many websites consisted mostly—and sometimes entirely—of technologies such as Flash; such plugins even afforded better performance. The notion of <strong>Rich Internet Applications</strong> (<strong>RIAs</strong>) prevailed as the pendulum swung back to fatter clients.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>See Google's "The Evolution of the Web" for an interactive graphic on web browsers and their implementation of modern browser features at <a class="ulink" href="http://evolutionofweb.appspot.com">http://evolutionofweb.appspot.com</a>.</p></div></div><p>The inclusion of plugin-based technologies became a red herring for the promise of the World Wide Web. While connectivity of content was a hallmark of the original principles of HTML, content was represented by tags such as <code class="literal">embed</code>, <code class="literal">object</code>, and <code class="literal">applet</code> where application modules are embedded onto a web page constituted black boxes that hid content from the semantic web.</p><p>Web browsers nevertheless evolved. JavaScript frameworks such as jQuery emerged to abstract browser differences and offer up richer interactivity. CSS techniques emerged to overcome the limitations and inconsistencies between the browsers. Newer browsers emerged with better support for web standards.</p><p>However, something was missing. Even though applications were being developed using browser-based technologies, many application features were left out of the browser. Consistent mechanisms to add video/audio playback, offline capabilities, and even browser history management were missing. Flash was still looked upon as filling in the missing pieces of the web.</p><p>Finally, browser development coalesced around HTML5 in 2009 when XHTML 2.0 was abandoned in lieu of something more backward compatible with earlier versions of HTML. HTML5 sought to address two major areas in the browser: the need for a more consistent, semantic markup language and the demand for more natively-supported browser features. When it was introduced in 2004, it heralded a set of APIs to make the browser into a true application development platform and thus more semantically amenable.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note02"/>Note</h3><p>

With the APIs that allow for better control of the experience, the client is finally beginning to catch up to its promise. Mobile web browsers have especially become a catalyst for this. Since Adobe Flash is not supported on devices such as the iPhone and iPad, and since implementation of HTML5 features on Safari have grown, HTML5 is quickly becoming a standard for mobile web application development. However, if this trend is to continue, browser makers and application developers must adhere to the developing standards for HTML5, which brings us back to the logo. To right the wrongs of the past, HTML5 must have collective agreement on implementation. In order to inculcate this, there is a burgeoning movement to enforce standards in web browsers and applications, and speed up implementation as adoption looms. The HTML5 logo is emblematic of that effort.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note03"/>Note</h3><p>The <strong>Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group</strong> (<strong>WHATWG</strong>) formed in 2004, evolved HTML and conceived of HTML5 as the next step in the evolution of the HTML standard. At that time, the W3C was working on the XHTML 2.0 standard; however, in 2009, the W3C decided to halt this effort and join the WHATWG in its effort to develop HTML5.</p><p>In January 2011, it announced that the HTML5 standard would be referred to as "HTML" and that the specification would henceforth be a living document.</p><p>In December 2012, the <strong>World Wide Web Consortium</strong> (<strong>W3C</strong>), the international web standards body, announced that HTML5 is feature complete. Although not a standard yet, it finally gives browser makers a stable target upon which to develop HTML5 features.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>It's all about semantics</h1></div></div></div><p>HTML5 makes an attempt to codify information on the web in a more cohesive way than before. With previous versions of HTML, content is structured based on how it should be displayed rather than its inherent meaning. The <code class="literal">div</code> tag is often used, but what does a <code class="literal">div</code> tag really mean? To get around this, application developers have broken up their content using <code class="literal">id</code> attributes based on standards and best practices of web presentation.</p><p>For example, application developers use tags such as the following:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">&lt;div id="header"&gt;
&lt;div id="footer"&gt;</pre></div><p>The obvious problem is that what gets used for the <code class="literal">id</code> attribute need not follow a standard. One application developer could use <code class="literal">id="header"</code> while another uses <code class="literal">id="head"</code>. In order to standardize structure based on semantics, HTML5 introduces a set of new tags that takes the vagaries out of the process.</p><p>HTML5 introduces a set of new top-level tags, which can be broken down into the following categories: content, language, layout, and format.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl2sec04"/>Content tags</h2></div></div></div><p>The content tags introduced in HTML5 define how new types of content can be embedded into a web page. Content such as sound, video, and graphics are surfaced in much the same way text and images have been for so many years.</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">audio</code>: This tag is used for embedding sound content. Before HTML5, either some browsers implemented support for audio inconsistently or a special player typically developed using Adobe Flash would have been required to play sound. HTML5 removes that dependency and makes the audio player a consistent function of the web browser itself.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">video</code>: This tag is used for embedding video content. Like with audio, there was inconsistent support or a special player was required to play video content. Web browsers that support the <code class="literal">video</code> tag have a built-in video player.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">canvas</code>: This tag allows for basic 2D to be drawn via JavaScript. 3D graphics are not consistently supported, however, and are optional.</li></ul></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl2sec05"/>Language tags</h2></div></div></div><p>With internationalization taking on more and more precedence, localization has been a special challenge for web developers. HTML5 introduces a set of new tags to help make content more accessible to larger audiences.</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">bdi</code>: This tag defines the directionality of text. This is typically used to support languages that are read right-to-left.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">ruby</code>: The <code class="literal">ruby</code> tag in conjunction with the <code class="literal">rt</code> and <code class="literal">rp</code> tags defines the Ruby annotation for East Asian typography.</li></ul></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl2sec06"/>Layout tags</h2></div></div></div><p>HTML5 comes with a set of first-class tags that not only help with laying out the page, but also allows for the page to be broken up altogether. With HTML5, web developers have the ability to share sections of content in a more standard way:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">header</code>: This tag defines the header of the page or of a section or article.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">footer</code>: This tag defines the footer of the page or of a section or article.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">nav</code>: This tag defines the menu structure of the website. These are the navigational links used to semantically break up the website.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">section</code>: This tag defines sections of a page. The <code class="literal">article</code> and <code class="literal">aside</code> tags are in a way specialized section tags.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">aside</code>: This tag defines the sidebar content for a page. Often, a web page is broken up with ancillary content pushed to the side.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">article</code>: This tag defines the main content for a page. While tags such as <code class="literal">section</code>, <code class="literal">aside</code>, <code class="literal">header</code>, and <code class="literal">footer</code> define ancillary content to the page, the <code class="literal">article</code> tag identifies the portion of content that is considered to be the focal point. Typically, this content is unique to the URI.</li></ul></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl2sec07"/>Format tags</h2></div></div></div><p>HTML5 introduces a new set of special tags, which define how areas of content can be identified and formatted appropriately.</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">figure</code>: This tag identifies non-contiguous content that is layered into a body of text. For example, it can be used to wrap diagrams, charts, and graphs that are referenced by a body of text.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">details</code>: This tag defines content that can be toggled as visible or hidden. It is geared towards showing and hiding content based on a user action such as help-related content. Web developers have built a variety of solutions to do this and, with HTML5, the web browser takes care of it.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">hgroup</code>: This tag wraps the well-known <code class="literal">h1</code>-<code class="literal">h6</code> tags into a cohesive structure. When headings are related, <code class="literal">hgroup</code> shows that they are related. For example, for an article with a title and subtitle, the title would be wrapped in an <code class="literal">h1</code> tag while the subtitle would be wrapped in an <code class="literal">h2</code> tag. The <code class="literal">hgroup</code> tag around them signifies that the <code class="literal">h2</code> tag is associated with the <code class="literal">h1</code> tag and not part of the document outline.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">wbr</code>: This tag defines a word break opportunity. Typically, lines of text are broken up by spaces. The <code class="literal">wbr</code> tag allows for the web developer to specify where in a set of contiguous non-space characters line breaks can be introduced when there is no room to display it all on one line.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">progress</code>: This tag indicates the progress of a task and can be used in conjunction with JavaScript to display a progress bar to the user.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">time</code>: This tag is a microformat tag that allows one to specify semantically that something is a date or time.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">meter</code>: This tag is a format tag to define a scalar measurement with a known range.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">mark</code>: This tag indicates text that is relevant to the user. Typically, this would be used for highlighting specific words within a passage.</li></ul></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl2sec08"/>Forms get an upgrade</h2></div></div></div><p>Forms in HTML5 get a whole new set of functionality to allow for better validation of content and ease of use.</p><p>The following tags are new with HTML5:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">datalist</code>: This tag works similarly to a <code class="literal">select</code> tag with the added feature of being able to type ahead to select items in the list.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">keygen</code>: This tag generates a key pair for use in forms. This is typically used for client authentication.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">output</code>: This tag indicates the result of a calculation. It is associated with a <code class="literal">form</code> tag to display simple calculations to the user especially when used in conjunction with the new form input types. In addition, the <code class="literal">input</code> tag gets a new set of types. The following input types are new with HTML5:<div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">color</code>: This type displays a color picker, which submits a hex code for that color.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">date</code>: This type displays a date picker, which submits a date.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">datetime</code>: This type displays a date and time picker, which submits a date and time including time zone.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">datetime-local</code>: This type displays a date and time picker, which submits a date and time without time zone.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">email</code>: This type displays a field for entering e-mail addresses.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">month</code>: This type displays a month-year picker, which submits a month and year.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">number</code>: This type displays a field constrained for entering numeric values.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">range</code>: This type constrains the user to select numbers within a range. Typically, this will display as a slider.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">search</code>: This type displays a search field.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">tel</code>: This type displays a field that constrains the user to typing in a valid telephone number.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">time</code>: This type displays a time picker.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">url</code>: This type displays a field that constrains the user to typing in a valid URL.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">week</code>: This type displays a control for picking a week within a year.</li></ul></div></li></ul></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl2sec09"/>Enter microdata</h2></div></div></div><p>HTML5 adds the ability to define custom semantics for your content. Similar to microformats in previous versions of HTML, in which a set of predetermined attributes would allow you to ascribe the semantic meaning of content, microdata allows you to create your own semantic language to ascribe to your content. While microformats rely on generic attributes such as <code class="literal">class</code> and <code class="literal">rel</code>, microdata introduces <code class="literal">itemscope</code>, <code class="literal">itemtype</code>, and <code class="literal">itemprop</code> to describe content. The <code class="literal">itemscope</code> and <code class="literal">itemtype</code> attributes allow you to define a custom type and indicate where it is defined. The <code class="literal">itemprop</code> attribute points to a specific property within the definition:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">&lt;div itemscope itemtype="http://mysite.com/Movie"&gt;
    &lt;h1 itemprop="title"&gt;Your Favorite Movie&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p itemprop="summary" &gt;
      A summary of your favorite movie.
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>An anatomy lesson</h1></div></div></div><p>Now that we know many of the new tools for building a page in HTML5, let us dive into what a page looks like.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl2sec10"/>A word about DOCTYPE</h2></div></div></div><p>The <code class="literal">DOCTYPE</code> declaration in HTML documents has always been a signal to the browser of the standards to which the document adheres. If a web browser knows the standards used for the document, it can more efficiently process and render that document. SGML-based markup languages require this.</p><p>In order to simplify the <code class="literal">DOCTYPE</code> tag, HTML5 has only one type:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</pre></div><p>Unlike previous versions of HTML, which required references to the specific DTD being followed, HTML5 is not based on SGML and thus the DTD reference is not required.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl2sec11"/>The lang attribute</h2></div></div></div><p>HTML5 introduces a simplified <code class="literal">lang</code> attribute for specifying the language of a page. In XHTML, an <code class="literal">xmlns</code> attribute was required, but HTML5 does not require this.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl2sec12"/>Metatags are important too</h2></div></div></div><p>HTML5 adds a new metatag called <code class="literal">charset</code>. This specifies the specific character encoding of the document. It otherwise uses all the metatags from HTML 4.01.</p><p>HTML5 includes support for the <code class="literal">viewport</code> metatag. This metatag defines how the web page should be viewed and includes parameters such as width and height. It also allows you to define zoom settings such as initial scale, and minimum and maximum scale. It even allows for the ability to target a specific density DPI in case you want to change how your page looks based on different screen resolutions.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl2sec13"/>Putting it all together</h2></div></div></div><p>A basic HTML5 page will look like the following code:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;My First HTML5 Page&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
  &lt;meta name="description" content="My first HTML5 page."&gt;
  &lt;meta name="author" content="Me"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre></div><p>We will of course add more to this as we go on.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec06"/>The application</h1></div></div></div><p>For much of this book, we will be building a mobile web application that illustrates many of the features of HTML5.
