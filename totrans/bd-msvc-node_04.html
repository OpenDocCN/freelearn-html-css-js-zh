			<p>In summary, harnessing the power of the JavaScript and Node.js ecosystem for microservices development offers a dynamic and efficient approach to building scalable and modular applications. By employing the lightweight and event-driven architecture of Node.js, developers can create microservices that communicate seamlessly and handle numerous concurrent connections. JavaScript’s ubiquity also enables full stack development, allowing code to be shared between the frontend and backend. Leveraging the extensive package ecosystem, including popular frameworks such as Express.js, simplifies the creation of APIs and facilitates rapid development. Node.js’s non-blocking I/O further enhances performance, making it well-suited for microservices that demand responsiveness.</p>
			<p>Nevertheless, careful consideration must be given to challenges such as service orchestration and inter-service communication, which can be addressed through frameworks such as Seneca or NestJS. In conclusion, tapping into the JavaScript and Node.js ecosystem empowers developers to construct agile, high-performance microservices architectures that adapt to the demands of modern applications.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we are going to learn about the infrastructure of microservices in Node.js.</p>
