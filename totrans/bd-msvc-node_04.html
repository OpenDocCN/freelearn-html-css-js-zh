			<h1 id="_idParaDest-85"><a id="_idTextAnchor086"/>Integration and interoperability and support for modern web standards</h1>
			<p>Integration and interoperability, along with support for modern web standards, are crucial concepts in the world of software development and technology. Let’s explore each of these areas in <span class="No-Break">more detail.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-86"><a id="_idTextAnchor087"/>Integration and interoperability</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Integration</strong> refers to the process of combining different<a id="_idIndexMarker209"/> software systems or components so that they work together as a unified whole. This is important because many modern applications are composed of various modules or services that need to communicate and share data seamlessly. Integration can occur at different levels, such as data integration, application integration, and <span class="No-Break">system integration.</span></p>
			<p>Meanwhile, <strong class="bold">interoperability</strong> is the ability of different systems <a id="_idIndexMarker210"/>or components to work together, even if they were developed independently by different vendors or teams. This ensures that systems can exchange data and use each other’s functions without requiring major modifications. Interoperability is crucial in heterogeneous environments where multiple technologies, platforms, and software <span class="No-Break">products coexist.</span></p>
			<p>The benefits of integration<a id="_idIndexMarker211"/> and interoperability<a id="_idIndexMarker212"/> include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Efficiency</strong>: Integrated systems can automate processes and reduce manual data entry, leading to improved efficiency and reduced <span class="No-Break">human errors.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data accuracy</strong>: Integration ensures that data is consistent across different systems, preventing data discrepancies and <span class="No-Break">improving decision-making.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scalability</strong>: Integrated systems can scale more easily as an organization’s needs grow, since the systems are designed to work together. Scalability is the ability of a system to handle increasing amounts of workload without compromising its performance or reliability. For example, Node.js uses a single thread to handle non-blocking I/O calls, which means that it can accept and process multiple concurrent requests without waiting for the completion of each one, and Node.js has a built-in module and cluster that allow you to create multiple instances or workers of the same application and distribute the workload among them. Also, Node.js supports the decomposition of an application into smaller and independent services or microservices that communicate with each other through events or messages. One big benefit it is that Node.js also supports the partitioning or sharding of data into multiple instances or databases, where each instance handles only a subset of <span class="No-Break">the data.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cost savings</strong>: Integration reduces the need for redundant data entry and maintenance, saving time <span class="No-Break">and resources.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Improved customer experience</strong>: Interoperable systems can provide a seamless experience for users, allowing <a id="_idIndexMarker213"/>them to interact with different services <a id="_idIndexMarker214"/><span class="No-Break">without disruptions.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Integration and operability, working together, ensure that applications/systems can work unified and independently for different vendors <span class="No-Break">or teams.</span></p>

				<li><strong class="bold">JavaScript</strong>: Modern JavaScript frameworks<a id="_idIndexMarker219"/> and libraries (e.g., React, Angular, and Vue.js) enable developers to create dynamic and interactive <span class="No-Break">web applications.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">RESTful APIs</strong>: <strong class="bold">Representational state transfer</strong> (<strong class="bold">REST</strong>) is a widely used architectural style <a id="_idIndexMarker220"/>for designing networked applications, allowing different systems to communicate <span class="No-Break">over HTTP.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Web security standards</strong>: HTTPS, <strong class="bold">Content Security Policy</strong> (<strong class="bold">CSP</strong>), and <strong class="bold">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</strong> (<strong class="bold">CORS</strong>) are examples of security-related standards<a id="_idIndexMarker221"/> that help protect <a id="_idIndexMarker222"/>users <span class="No-Break">and data.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Web accessibility</strong>: The <strong class="bold">WCAG</strong> (<strong class="bold">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</strong>) is the most<a id="_idIndexMarker223"/> widely recognized<a id="_idIndexMarker224"/> set of accessibility<a id="_idIndexMarker225"/> guidelines. It<a id="_idIndexMarker226"/> is developed by the <strong class="bold">Web Accessibility Initiative</strong> (<strong class="bold">WAI</strong>) of the <strong class="bold">World Wide Web </strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">Consortium</strong></span><span class="No-Break"> (</span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold">W3C</strong></span><span class="No-Break">).</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>In addition to these features, supporting modern web standards<a id="_idIndexMarker227"/> offers several benefits, such as <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
