It is written for web developers who would like to learn about Highcharts. This book has the following features:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">It is a step-by-step guide on building presentable charts from basic looking ones</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">There are plenty of examples with real data covering all the Highcharts series types—line/spline, column, pie, donut, scatter, bubble, area range, column range, gauge, solid gauge, pyramid, box plot, spider, waterfall, funnel, error bar, heatmaps, and 3D charts</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Subject areas are included that haven't yet been covered in online reference manuals and demos, such as chart layout structure, color shading, and in-depth explanations of some specific options such as sizeBy in the bubble series, groupZPadding in the column series, and how to modify or create plugins</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Applications demonstrating how to create dynamic and interactive charts using Highcharts APIs and events handling are covered</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Applications demonstrating how to integrate Highcharts with a mobile framework such as jQuery Mobile and a Rich Internet Application framework such as Ext JS are also covered</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Applications demonstrating how to run Highcharts on the server side for automating charts generation and exporting their graphical outputs are also covered</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Using the latest online service Highcharts Cloud, you'll learn to embed the graphs into documents</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">You'll also learn the structure of Highcharts plugins and how to create plugins</li></ul></div><p>This book is not a reference manual as the Highcharts team has already done an excellent job in providing a comprehensive online reference, and each configuration is coupled with jsFiddle demos. This book also does not aim to be a chart design guide nor a tutorial on programming design with Highcharts.</p><p>In short, this book shows you what you can do with Highcharts.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>The second edition includes four new chapters, a rewritten chapter, and new sections in some of the existing chapters. All the contents from the previous edition have been technically revised. As a result, the new edition consists of about 50 percent new material.</p><p>As this book contains a myriad of examples, it would be impractical to include all the source code of each example. For step-by-step tutorials, the code is listed incrementally. If you want to experiment with the sample code, you are strongly recommended to download the code from the Packt Publishing website or visit <a class="ulink" href="http://joekuan.org/Learning_Highcharts">http://joekuan.org/Learning_Highcharts</a> for online demos.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Web Charts">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Web Charts</em></span>, describes how web charts have been done since the birth of HTML to the latest HTML5 standard with SVG and canvas technologies.

The chapter also explores how to create an open donut chart with specific options.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Gauge, Polar, and Range Charts">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Gauge, Polar, and Range Charts</em></span>, is a step-by-step guide on constructing a twin dial speedometer and the creation of a simple solid gauge chart. It also demonstrates the polar chart's characteristics and its similarity to a Cartesian chart. It also illustrates the use of range data on area and column range charts.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Bubble, Box Plot, and Error Bar Charts">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Bubble, Box Plot, and Error Bar Charts</em></span>, explains the characteristics of bubble charts and their specific options. The chapter establishes a gradual approach on creating a bubble chart similar to a real life sport chart, applies the same exercise to a box plot with environmental data, and provides a tutorial on error bar charts using racing data.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Waterfall, Funnel, Pyramid, and Heatmap Charts">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Waterfall, Funnel, Pyramid, and Heatmap Charts</em></span>, illustrates how to configure waterfall and funnel charts and uses the drilldown feature to link both charts. Then there is a tutorial on pyramid charts and reconstructing them from a financial brochure. Then, heatmap charts are introduced and different outputs are shown by experiencing a number of series options.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. 3D Charts">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>3D Charts</em></span>, discusses what 3D charts in Highcharts really means and demonstrates the concept of 3D charts, such as column, pie, and scatter series. It illustrates specific 3D options with experiments and reconstructs a 3D chart from infographics. The chapter also covers how to create interactive 3D orientations with mouse actions.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Highcharts APIs">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Highcharts APIs</em></span>, explains the usage of Highcharts APIs and illustrates this by using a stock market demo to draw dynamic charts.

<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>Readers are expected to have basic knowledge of web development in the following areas:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The structure of a HTML document and its syntax</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Ajax</li></ul></div><p>As this book is all about Highcharts, which is developed in JavaScript, readers should be comfortable with the language at an intermediate level. Some of the examples use jQuery as a quick way to access document elements and bind methods to events. Hence, a basic knowledge of jQuery should be sufficient. Some knowledge of jQuery UI would also be an advantage, as it is lightly used in <a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Highcharts APIs">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Highcharts APIs</em></span> and <a class="link" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Highcharts Events">Chapter 11</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Highcharts Events</em></span>.</p></div>
