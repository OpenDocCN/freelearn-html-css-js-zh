<h1 class="chapterTitle" id="_idParaDest-113">Erasers, Selections, and the Sub View Palette</h1>
<p class="normal">Whether you draw with pencils on paper and then ink digitally or draw digitally from start to finish, a certain amount of refinement is needed in most art processes. We will use a variety of tools in this chapter to refine our images, from erasers to selection tools that allow us to scale and rotate sections of our image. We will also learn about a great feature of Clip Studio Paint, the <strong class="screenText">Sub View</strong> palette, which allows us to store and use reference images easily.</p>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Erasers and using transparent color as an eraser</li>
<li class="bulletList">Lassos and other selection tools</li>
<li class="bulletList">Loading reference images to the Sub View palette</li>
<li class="bulletList">Using Layer Color to prepare a sketch</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Let’s get started with refining our pencil work!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-114">Technical requirements</h1>
<p class="normal">To get started, you need Clip Studio Paint installed on your device and a new canvas opened with any dark color. Any size is fine, but I recommend creating a 300 dpi square canvas to go through the content in this chapter.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-115">Eraser tools and transparent color</h1>
<p class="normal">No matter whether we are penciling, inking, or coloring, mishaps do happen. Especially when we are creating very neat and slick styles of art, eraser tools and transparent color become our guardians. They are not only for erasing unnecessary marks; we can also use them tactically, such as for brightness, light reflections, cut-out frames, disappearing objects, and rainy scenes. Read on to find out more.</p>
<p class="normal">There is a selection of dedicated eraser tools in Clip Studio Paint that is accessed by clicking on the <strong class="screenText">Eraser</strong> icon in the toolbar and then choosing an option from the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> palette. Each of these <strong class="screenText">Eraser</strong> sub tools has a different use. But, by using the transparent color selection in the Color Picker option in the toolbar, we can also transform any mark-making tool into an eraser. We will touch on transparent colors in more detail in the <em class="italic">Using transparent color</em> section later. Before we get into transparent colors, though, let’s talk about some of the eraser tools in Clip Studio Paint and what they do.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-116">The eraser tools</h1>
<p class="normal">Once you start <a id="_idIndexMarker415"/>drawing, you need an eraser to correct a mistake or give a half-erased texture to your image, which is the same in digital drawing. There are various useful erasers in Clip Studio Paint. The screenshot on the right shows the Eraser sub tools in Clip Studio Paint.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_06_6.1.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.1: The Eraser sub tool menu</p>
<p class="normal">Each of these <a id="_idIndexMarker416"/>tools has a different look and use. Let’s briefly explore each one now.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">If you are using a graphics tablet that has an eraser end to the stylus, like some models of <strong class="screenText">Wacom</strong> tablets have, then the currently selected <strong class="screenText">Eraser</strong> sub tool will be the one used when the <strong class="screenText">Eraser</strong> button on the stylus is activated.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-117">Hard eraser</h2>
<p class="normal">The Hard eraser is <a id="_idIndexMarker417"/>a pressure-sensitive eraser<a id="_idIndexMarker418"/> tool with a hard edge. Since it is pressure-sensitive, when a graphics tablet is being used, it is a very versatile tool because simply varying how hard you are pressing with the stylus changes how small or large the area being erased becomes. So, this eraser tool is just like a pressure-sensitive pen: you can use it to control the line width, as if you’re drawing with a pen tool!</p>
<p class="normal">The screenshot on the right shows some examples of the Hard eraser tool in action.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_06_6.2_New.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.2: Hard eraser usage</p>
<p class="normal">You can see this eraser has a very clear edge; it comes in handy when you want to erase sections with defined edges. I can say that this is the most basic eraser!</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">I strongly recommend using the <strong class="screenText">Undo</strong> button when you don’t feel right about the line<a id="_idIndexMarker419"/> you<a id="_idIndexMarker420"/> have just drawn, rather than using the Hard eraser tool to refine it, because the Hard eraser tool is best for chiseling the edge of lines, not refining them. I normally rest my left hand on top of <em class="italic">Cmd + Z</em>, then repeat: draw, undo, draw, undo… until I create the desired line. I find I always get the best result and can work faster this way. You can also map this shortcut to a button on your tablet, so it is easily on hand.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-118">Soft eraser</h2>
<p class="normal">The Soft eraser<a id="_idIndexMarker421"/> is also a pressure-sensitive tool. It has<a id="_idIndexMarker422"/> a soft, blurry edge to it, and the best usage is to reduce color in a very soft way, as shown on the right of the screenshot on the left.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_06_6.3.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.3: Soft eraser</p>
<p class="normal">This eraser is great for using in effects, such as fading one color to another or making a subtle gradient. It can be used for general erasing as well.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-119">Rough eraser</h2>
<p class="normal">The Rough <a id="_idIndexMarker423"/>eraser <a id="_idIndexMarker424"/>tool is a non-pressure-sensitive tool with a hard edge. Because it is not pressure-sensitive by default, the size of the tool will remain consistent, despite any variations in the pressure on the stylus.</p>
<p class="normal">The screenshot on the right shows an example of the Rough eraser in use.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_06_6.4.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.4: Rough eraser</p>
<p class="normal">Since it is not<a id="_idIndexMarker425"/> pressure-sensitive, it’s better to use it for<a id="_idIndexMarker426"/> rough sketches rather than detailed drawings.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-120">Vector eraser</h2>
<p class="normal">The Vector <a id="_idIndexMarker427"/>eraser<a id="_idIndexMarker428"/> can be used on raster layers, but it is most useful on vector layers because on vector layers, you can erase a whole line or a shape with one stroke of the Vector eraser! We will be discussing vector layers in detail in <em class="italic">Chapter 10</em>, <em class="italic">Exploring</em> <em class="italic">Vector Layers</em>.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-121">Multiple Layers eraser</h2>
<p class="normal">Got a speck<a id="_idIndexMarker429"/> or<a id="_idIndexMarker430"/> splotch on your image that shouldn’t be there, but you can’t find the layer it’s on? The Multiple Layers eraser can take care of it quickly. Just make sure you’re not erasing part of the image that you want to keep in the process of using it, though!</p>
<p class="normal">The Multiple Layers eraser tool erases content from multiple layers at a time. It will delete the content of the area where it is used from every layer in the stack. The following screenshot shows an image composed of multiple layers. The background color layer is locked, as you see a lock icon next to it:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_06_6.5.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.5: Multiple layers</p>
<p class="normal">There are<a id="_idIndexMarker431"/> three <a id="_idIndexMarker432"/>splotches in the preceding image, which are circled, waiting to be erased but… we don’t know which layer they are on! Instead of going through each layer to make it invisible to check which one they are on, let’s use the <strong class="screenText">Multiple Layers</strong> eraser tool. Since it affects all layers, we can clean these marks up no matter which layer they are on. One warning, though; don’t forget to lock the background color layer if you don’t want the <a id="_idIndexMarker433"/>background <a id="_idIndexMarker434"/>color to be erased, so that the layer is unaffected.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-122">Snap eraser</h2>
<p class="normal">If you need<a id="_idIndexMarker435"/> to <a id="_idIndexMarker436"/>erase only a part that is aligned to the ruler, this is the tool for you.</p>
<p class="normal">This eraser snaps to the ruler shape, so other parts of the image will not be affected. You can see this in the following screenshot on the right:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_06_6.6.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.6: Snap eraser</p>
<p class="normal">The Snap eraser tool erases following the ruler line, to express the lighting on the building. We discuss <strong class="screenText">rulers</strong> further in <em class="italic">Chapter 13</em>, <em class="italic">All about Rulers</em>.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-123">Kneaded eraser</h2>
<p class="normal">For artists who<a id="_idIndexMarker437"/> want more of an analog look to their <a id="_idIndexMarker438"/>drawings, the Kneaded eraser (or as some artists might refer to it, a <em class="italic">putty rubber eraser</em>) does a good job. It offers very delicate erasing work on the drawing, such as a skin texture, as seen in the screenshot on the left.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_06_6.7.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.7: Kneaded eraser texture work</p>
<p class="normal">Now that we’ve talked about our dedicated eraser tools, let’s talk about using the transparent option in the color picker to turn any tool into an eraser.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-124">Using transparent color</h1>
<p class="normal">At the bottom <a id="_idIndexMarker439"/>of the toolbar in the Clip Studio interface are two squares that show the currently selected foreground and background colors. Below these is also a rectangle filled with a checkerboard pattern. This is shown in the screenshot on the right, underneath the foreground and background color selections:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_06_6.8.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.8: Toolbar color swatch</p>
<p class="normal">The checkerboard pattern is how transparency is shown in digital art programs. Having this transparent swatch means that we can quickly turn any tool into an eraser just by changing our color selection to transparent.</p>
<p class="normal">This option is used to make special effects with textured erasers. The screenshot on the right shows the <strong class="screenText">G-Pen</strong> tool and <strong class="screenText">Soft</strong> decoration tool being used as an eraser with the transparent option to express the rain and atmosphere on the left, and the <strong class="screenText"><a id="_idIndexMarker440"/></strong><strong class="screenText">Pampas grass</strong> decoration tool is used as an eraser on the right:</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_06_6.9.png"/></p>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.9: Erasing by using the various drawing tools</p>
<p class="normal">Of course, these are just a few examples of the effects that can be achieved by using transparency as a painting color.</p>
<p class="normal">Surprisingly, there<a id="_idIndexMarker441"/> are more ways of erasing and editing your art! Let’s move on to the various selection tools that can be utilized in Clip Studio Paint.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-125">Lassos and other selection tools</h1>
<p class="normal">One of the most <a id="_idIndexMarker442"/>useful features of creating art in a digital space is the ability to move, scale, rotate, flip, and otherwise transform all or parts of the drawing to obtain exactly the right look. In this section, we will use selection tools to clean up and correct a sketch with several errors in it. You can follow along with a sketch of your own or use the following sketch as a reference. These tools can be used with any sketches on your canvas.</p>
<p class="normal">The following is the sketch that we will be looking at in this section:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_06_6.10.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.10: A sketch with the Clip Studio Paint interface</p>
<p class="normal">There are several issues with this drawing, and we will use the selection and transformation tools to correct them. The character’s left hand is a little too big, the bunch of hair <a id="_idIndexMarker443"/>on top of the head needs to be a different shape, and the headdress ribbon needs to be shaped better. Let’s use the selection area and other selection tools to fix these problems.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-126">The Rectangle and Ellipse selection area tools</h2>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Rectangle</strong> and<a id="_idIndexMarker444"/> <strong class="screenText">Ellipse</strong> tools <a id="_idIndexMarker445"/>both work in the same way; the only difference is the shape of the selection they produce. We can use these tools when our selection doesn’t need to be precise. For the sketch we are going to be correcting, we will use the Rectangle tool to correct the size of the character’s left hand in our drawing.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">I recommend that any overlapping objects, such as an arm in front of the body, or characters standing in front of others, should be in different layers to make manipulation easier.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Even though we are going to use the Rectangle tool, the Ellipse tool operates in exactly the same way.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s use the <a id="_idIndexMarker446"/>Rectangle <a id="_idIndexMarker447"/>tool and the <strong class="screenText">Selection Launcher</strong> options to resize a portion of our drawing by following the steps here:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Identify the area of the drawing that needs refining. In the case of our sketch, we will be resizing the character’s hand to correct the proportions.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Select the <strong class="screenText">Selection area</strong> icon from the toolbar. Then, select the <strong class="screenText">Rectangle </strong>tool from the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> palette.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Using the mouse or stylus, hold down and drag the <strong class="screenText">Selection area</strong> tool around the section of the drawing to be selected. When the appropriate area is outlined, release the mouse or stylus button to complete the selection. The following screenshot shows an example of a rectangle selection:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_06_6.11.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.11: A rectangle selection</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="4">Select the <strong class="screenText">Scale/Rotate</strong> icon, which is the fourth from the right on the <strong class="screenText">Selection</strong> <a id="_idIndexMarker448"/>command <a id="_idIndexMarker449"/>bar. Use the square handles at the corners of the selection to resize the section of the drawing by dragging them in or out.</li>
<li class="numberedList">If an undesired change is made, click on the <strong class="screenText">Cancel</strong> icon beneath the selected area.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Try keeping the wrist of the hand aligned with the arm. Once the area matches the newly desired size, click on the <strong class="screenText">OK</strong> button beneath the selection, as in the following screenshot, or press <em class="italic">Enter</em> on the keyboard to commit the changes:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_06_6.12.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.12: Resized hand image</p>
<p class="normal-one">Note that if you try to select a different tool or perform another operation while the selection is still in transform mode, a message will appear asking whether you would like to commit the changes.</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="7">Use the <strong class="screenText">Eraser</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Brush</strong> tools to correct any areas in the sketch that do not align, such as wrists and ankles.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">Selecting with rectangles and circles is all well and good, but what about when we have an <a id="_idIndexMarker450"/>area that is <a id="_idIndexMarker451"/>a much more complicated shape than that? Let’s learn how to use the other tools from the <strong class="screenText">Selection</strong> command bar.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-127">The Selection Launcher</h2>
<p class="normal">Let’s look <a id="_idIndexMarker452"/>at <a id="_idIndexMarker453"/>the launcher that appears just underneath the selection you made. You can usually get by using only your favorite functions in the launcher, but it’s always good to know other important functions too. The selection launcher contains useful tools, as the following screenshot shows.</p>
<p class="normal">From left to<a id="_idIndexMarker454"/> right, the options in<a id="_idIndexMarker455"/> the selection launcher and their functions are as follows:</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="img/6.10.png"/></p>
<p class="normal">If you hover a cursor on the horizontal bar under the command bar, the cursor turns <a id="_idIndexMarker456"/>into a<a id="_idIndexMarker457"/> hand. If you click and hold, you can move the command bar anywhere on the canvas!</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-128">The Lasso and Polyline selection area tools</h2>
<p class="normal">For more <a id="_idIndexMarker458"/>complicated<a id="_idIndexMarker459"/> selections, the <strong class="screenText">Lasso</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Polyline</strong> tools are good tools to know about. They work in basically the same way. The Lasso tool is being used in the next set of instructions, but the Polyline tool will also be covered.</p>
<p class="normal">The Lasso tool allows curved and rounded selection areas, while the Polyline tool can make complex shapes, but each segment of the selection area must be a straight line.</p>
<p class="normal">Follow these steps to select and horizontally flip a selected area of the drawing:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Identify the area of the drawing to be selected and choose the appropriate tool from the <strong class="screenText">Selection area</strong> category of sub tools. To use the Lasso tool, hold down the mouse or stylus button and drag to trace around the area, releasing the button once you’re back to the starting point. An example of the Lasso tool is shown on the right.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_06_6.14.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.14: Lasso selection area</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="2">To use the <a id="_idIndexMarker460"/>Polyline<a id="_idIndexMarker461"/> tool, click with the mouse or stylus and move to another area. Click again to set another point of the selection area border. Continue this process until you come around to the beginning point to complete the selection area, or double-click to draw a straight line from the current point to the starting point. The screenshot on the left shows the process of selecting a section using Polyline just before clicking the starting point.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_06_6.15.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.15: Polyline selection area</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="3">To begin <a id="_idIndexMarker462"/>the <a id="_idIndexMarker463"/>transformation process, click on the <strong class="screenText">Scale/Rotate</strong> icon, which is fourth from the right in the Selection Launcher.</li>
<li class="numberedList">In order to flip the selection area horizontally, we need to look at the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette. The <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette is shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_06_6.16.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.16: The Rectangle tool’s Tool property palette</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="5">In the<a id="_idIndexMarker464"/> set<a id="_idIndexMarker465"/> of rectangular icons at the top of the <strong class="screenText">Transformation settings</strong>, click on the <strong class="screenText">Flip vertical at center of rotation</strong> icon, which is the second from the left, to mirror the currently selected area vertically.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Adjust the selection area to the correct position, then click on the <strong class="screenText">OK</strong> icon beneath the selection or press <em class="italic">Enter</em> on the keyboard.</li>
<li class="numberedList">The flipped and adjusted section of the drawing is shown here:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_06_6.17.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.17: The flipped part</p>
<p class="normal">Yes, the bunch of hair is now a mirror image! Use the <strong class="screenText">Pencil</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Eraser</strong> tools to clean anything that might have been jutting out or missing after flipping the image.</p>
<p class="normal">You have<a id="_idIndexMarker466"/> seen several<a id="_idIndexMarker467"/> different ways to erase part of your art. Isn’t it great to know more about editing your art using rich functions for selection tools?</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-129">Using the Tool property palette to scale or rotate a selection</h2>
<p class="normal">As <a id="_idIndexMarker468"/>mentioned <a id="_idIndexMarker469"/>previously, the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette for the Selection area tools changes its contents when the <strong class="screenText">Scale/Rotate</strong> function is activated with a selection. The <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette becomes a transformation command center, and it’s really important to know what it’s capable of! Let’s take a closer look at this palette before we move on.</p>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Transformation settings</strong> area in the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette is shown on the left.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_06_6.18.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.18: Lasso tool properties</p>
<p class="normal">These settings<a id="_idIndexMarker470"/> are accessible when either a selection area or the contents of an entire layer are being scaled or rotated. To transform the contents of an entire layer, simply select the layer from the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette, then click on the <strong class="screenText">Scale/Rotate</strong> icon in the main menu at the top of the interface window, between the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu and the <strong class="screenText">Canvas Display</strong> area. A bounding box will appear around the contents of the layer.</p>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Transformation settings</strong> area has five icons at the top of the palette, as you can see in the following image.</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="img/6.14.png"/></p>
<p class="normal">Below these icons are other transformation options, described here:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Mode types</strong>: You can pick a mode type that decides how you transform the image from the drop-down menu<strong class="screenText">: Sacle/Rotate</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Scale</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Rotate</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Free Transformation</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Distort</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Skew</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Perspective</strong>.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Reference Point</strong>: Allows the rotation point to be set in the current bounding box. The default setting is the center of the area being transformed, but other options can be chosen from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Change vector width</strong>: This is only used when transforming vector images. We will discuss vectors in more detail in <em class="italic">Chapter 10</em>, <em class="italic">Exploring</em> <em class="italic">Vector Layers</em>.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Keep original image</strong>: This will retain the original image when the transformation takes place. For instance, with this box checked, if we move a selection to the left, then Clip Studio Paint will copy the area being transformed and create two instances of it. It’s so useful when you want to duplicate the element without growing the number of layers or layer folders! In the the screenshot on the right, the duplicated scene<a id="_idIndexMarker471"/> has <a id="_idIndexMarker472"/>been moved and re-touched to the next panel while this box is checked, resulting in a time-passing scene being created:</li>
</ul>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_06_6.20.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.20: Panels using duplicated image</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Scale ratio</strong>: Controls the ratio of both the width and height of the area <a id="_idIndexMarker473"/>being transformed. Using the sliders, the <a id="_idIndexMarker474"/>selection can be transformed precisely on either axis. Activating the <strong class="screenText">Keep aspect ratio</strong> checkbox below the sliders will ensure that the original proportions of the transformed area are preserved so that the image doesn’t become skewed in either direction.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Rotation angle</strong>: This is a slider that controls the rotation of the area being transformed. This slider can be used to rotate a selected area precisely. Alternatively, moving the mouse cursor to a corner of the bounding box and slightly to the outside of it will produce a curved double-headed arrow that can be used to free-rotate the selection.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Adjust position</strong>: This is a drop-down menu that controls the position of the transformed area. Setting this to <strong class="screenText">Free position</strong> allows us to move, rotate, and scale the transformed area however we wish. Another setting is <strong class="screenText">Canvas</strong>, which automatically resizes the selection area to the size of the canvas and sets it in the center.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Interpolation method</strong>: This contains the options for how Clip Studio Paint blends colors of adjacent pixels during scaling up and down. The <strong class="screenText">Smooth edges (bilinear)</strong> setting blends colors of adjacent pixels and smooths them, but this may lead to a blurry outline, depending on the content<a id="_idIndexMarker475"/> being <a id="_idIndexMarker476"/>transformed. <strong class="screenText">Hard edges (nearest neighbor)</strong> maintains a sharp color separation by not blending based on adjacent pixels; however, this may lead to unwanted rough edges. <strong class="screenText">Clear edges (bicubic)</strong> blends and smooths the color separations for a smooth transition, and when the image is rotated, the outline is processed so that it is more emphasized than the <strong class="screenText">Smooth</strong> option. White noise may occur around the outline, however. <strong class="screenText">High accuracy (average colors)</strong> calculates the average color of each pixel contained in an image after transformation. The image becomes clear when it’s enlarged, and softer when it’s shrunk. A thin line will not be interrupted when it’s shrunk. However, the edges of the shrunk image can be blurred, and you may need to go back and forward with other options to get your desired result on an image that contains a lot of thin lines.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A close up of two ears  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_06_6.21.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.21: Various interpolation methods</p>
<p class="normal">The most<a id="_idIndexMarker477"/> commonly <a id="_idIndexMarker478"/>used methods are the <strong class="screenText">Smooth edges </strong>option for black and white images and <strong class="screenText">High accuracy</strong> for color images.</p>
<p class="normal">Now, let’s learn about some more organic selection tools.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-130">Selection pen</h2>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Selection</strong><strong class="screenText"><a id="_idIndexMarker479"/></strong> pen is another sub<a id="_idIndexMarker480"/> tool of the Selection area tool category. To use the <strong class="screenText">Selection </strong>pen, select it from the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> palette. Then use the mouse or stylus to draw out a selection.

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.22: Area selected with the Selection pen</p>
<p class="normal">Any area highlighted by the Selection pen (which defaults to a bright green highlight color) will <a id="_idIndexMarker481"/>be included in the<a id="_idIndexMarker482"/> selection. The screenshot on the left shows the selection that is made from the highlighted area:</p>

<p class="normal">The Selection pen makes highly precise selections easier. If you need to make a smaller selection, simply make the Selection pen brush size smaller. To select large areas, make <a id="_idIndexMarker483"/>the brush<a id="_idIndexMarker484"/> size larger.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">To add more areas to a selection, hold down the <em class="italic">Shift</em> button on the keyboard while moving the mouse or stylus. To remove areas from a selection, hold down the <em class="italic">Alt</em> key.

<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-131">Shrink selection</h2>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Shrink selection</strong> tool <a id="_idIndexMarker485"/>allows<a id="_idIndexMarker486"/> us to quickly and easily isolate elements of a drawing without the tedium of having to be overly precise. Follow these steps to use the Shrink selection tool:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Select the <strong class="screenText">Shrink selection</strong> sub tool from the <strong class="screenText">Selection area</strong> category of tools.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Use the mouse or stylus to drag around the elements to be selected. As shown in the following screenshot, this selection does not need to be precise:</li>

<p class="normal">Now that we’ve learned all about the selection tools, let’s learn about a palette that is a big help <a id="_idIndexMarker495"/>in organizing<a id="_idIndexMarker496"/> your reference images. Read on to learn about the <strong class="screenText">Sub View</strong> palette.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-133">The Sub View palette</h1>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Sub View</strong> palette<a id="_idIndexMarker497"/> can seem like an enigma to some, but I find it to be one of the handiest palettes in the entire Clip Studio Paint interface. Let’s delve into this simple yet powerful little palette.</p>
<p class="normal">When you first start using Clip Studio Paint, the <strong class="screenText">Sub View</strong> palette looks as shown in the screenshot on the right.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_06_6.28.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.28: Sub View palette</p>
<p class="normal">It doesn’t seem to have any purpose when you first look at it! So, what is it for?</p>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Sub View</strong> palette allows us to load images into it and view, zoom, rotate, flip, and select colors from those images. If you are a comic book artist, this palette can be used to hold character designs, concept art, background design sketches, color swatches, and any other images you may need access to on a regular basis while making comics. For illustrators, this can be used to hold reference images or other inspiration. It’s a little reference library that remembers the images loaded into it so that you don’t have to go through the process of opening <a id="_idIndexMarker498"/>them in new windows every time you open Clip Studio Paint.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s learn how to use the <strong class="screenText">Sub View</strong> palette now.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-134">Loading images into the Sub View palette</h2>
<p class="normal">Follow these <a id="_idIndexMarker499"/>steps to load images into the <strong class="screenText">Sub View</strong> palette <a id="_idIndexMarker500"/>and navigate through the images in the library:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">In the <strong class="screenText">Sub View</strong> palette, click on the <strong class="screenText">Import</strong> icon (it looks like a folder – or a picture, depending on your device – with an arrow pointing to the right). This will open your file browser.</li>
<li class="numberedList">In the file browser, navigate to the image to be imported. Click on the file to select it. Click <strong class="screenText">Open</strong> to complete the import.</li>
<li class="numberedList">To add several images at once, hold down the <em class="italic">Shift</em> or <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> key on the keyboard and select the files, then click <strong class="screenText">Open</strong> to import all the selected files at once.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Once images are loaded into the <strong class="screenText">Sub View</strong> palette, we can see them in this palette and flip through them. The screenshot on the right shows the <strong class="screenText">Sub View</strong> palette with some of my character designs.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_06_6.29.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.29: Sub View palette with an image</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="5">To see the <a id="_idIndexMarker501"/>other images loaded into <a id="_idIndexMarker502"/>the <strong class="screenText">Sub View</strong> palette, locate the left and right arrows next to the <strong class="screenText">Eyedropper</strong> icon. Clicking on either of these arrows will navigate to the previous or next image in the <strong class="screenText">Sub View</strong> palette.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">Note that these arrows will only be active if more than one image is imported into the <strong class="screenText">Sub View</strong> palette.</p>
<p class="normal">Alternatively, you can also pick an image that you want to display from an image list view by clicking the 9 square grid icon, which is the fourth from the right, as shown in the screenshot on the right.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a video game  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_06_6.30.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.30: Image list view</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="6">You can also open the image as a new canvas by clicking the second from bottom icon, which looks like a paper and a pencil. To delete an image from the <strong class="screenText">Sub View</strong> palette, click on the <strong class="screenText">Clear</strong> icon in the bottom-right corner of the palette. This icon looks like a trash can. This will <a id="_idIndexMarker503"/>only <a id="_idIndexMarker504"/>clear the image from the <strong class="screenText">Sub View</strong> palette and will not delete it from your computer.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-135">Zooming, rotating, and picking a color from the Sub View images</h2>
<p class="normal">In addition <a id="_idIndexMarker505"/>to <a id="_idIndexMarker506"/>being <a id="_idIndexMarker507"/>able to build a reference library in the <strong class="screenText">Sub View</strong> palette, we can also zoom, rotate, flip, and select colors from those images.</p>
<p class="normal">To zoom into an image loaded into <strong class="screenText">Sub View</strong>, use the slider located directly below the image view area of the palette. Alternatively, the <strong class="screenText">-</strong> and <strong class="screenText">+</strong> magnifying glass icons located to the right of the slider can also be used to zoom in and out little by little. The <strong class="screenText">Fit to Navigator</strong> icon ensures that the image resizes to fit the <strong class="screenText">Sub View</strong> window as the palette is resized. When an image is zoomed in and the eyedropper is not active, placing the cursor over the image will change it to the <strong class="screenText">Move</strong> tool and allow you to drag the image around to view specific areas.</p>
<p class="normal">To rotate an image in <strong class="screenText">Sub View</strong>, the slider below the zoom slider can be used. Drag the rectangle in the center of the slider to the left or right to rotate the image. The <strong class="screenText">Rotate left</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Rotate right</strong> arrows can also be used to rotate the image incrementally and precisely in either direction. The screenshot on the right shows <a id="_idIndexMarker508"/>a <a id="_idIndexMarker509"/>rotated<strong class="screenText"> Sub View</strong> image.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_06_6.31.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.31: Rotated Sub View image</p>
<p class="normal">To reset the image to its original rotation, click on the <strong class="screenText">Reset Rotate</strong> icon to the right of the rotate arrows.</p>
<p class="normal">To the right of the rotation settings are two icons. They are <strong class="screenText">Flip Horizontal</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Flip Vertical</strong>, and they flip the current <strong class="screenText">Sub View</strong> image on either axis. The screenshot on the left is our <strong class="screenText">Sub View</strong> image example, flipped vertically:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_06_6.32.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.32: Flipped Sub View image</p>
<p class="normal">As mentioned<a id="_idIndexMarker510"/> previously, color<a id="_idIndexMarker511"/> selection<a id="_idIndexMarker512"/> is also possible from <strong class="screenText">Sub View</strong> images. To switch from the default hand tool used to interact with the loaded image to the color picker, click on the eyedropper icon located at the bottom right. The eyedropper will now be active over the <strong class="screenText">Sub View</strong> image. Clicking with the eyedropper will select the color from the image and make it the active foreground or background color, depending on which is selected in the toolbar.</p>
<p class="normal">In the next section, we will learn how to prepare a sketch for digital inking using the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong><strong class="screenText"><a id="_idIndexMarker513"/></strong><strong class="screenText"> Color</strong> <a id="_idIndexMarker514"/>setting <a id="_idIndexMarker515"/>that was briefly mentioned in the previous chapter. Read on to learn more.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-136">Using Layer Color to prepare a sketch for inks</h1>
<p class="normal">We’re going to<a id="_idIndexMarker516"/> wrap<a id="_idIndexMarker517"/> up this chapter by learning about one way that Clip Studio Paint solves a common digital art problem. Those of you reading this book who have done digital art in the past might be familiar with the following scenario.</p>
<p class="normal">You finalize your sketch and create a layer for your final inks. You ink for a bit and then realize that something in the sketch needs to be changed. You switch back to the sketch layer and make the correction, then continue inking. It isn’t until you finish inking that you realize you never switched back to your ink layer, and now you have your inks on the same layer as the pencil sketch and must start over.</p>
<p class="normal">This is an extremely frustrating and common problem when working with digital layers. Thankfully, the makers of Clip Studio Paint have given us a feature that makes this a thing of the past. Sure, you could prevent this by locking the sketch layer so that no changes can be made to it at all, but then if a change needs to be made, you have to spend the time unlocking it before you can correct an error or adjust a detail. This seems minor, but locking and unlocking a layer takes precious time, and I am all about streamlining the workflow as much as possible!</p>
<p class="normal">Follow these steps to turn a sketch layer blue and begin inking over it on another layer:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Open a file with a sketch layer. If you don’t have one, use the directions in <em class="italic">Chapter 3</em>, <em class="italic">Penciling: Layer and Layer Property Palettes</em>, to set up a file with layers, then make a sketch on the sketch layer.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Once we have our finished sketch layer and made sure it is the active layer in the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette, we click on the <strong class="screenText">Layer Color</strong> icon in the <strong class="screenText">Layer Property</strong> palette. This will turn the entire contents of the selected layer into a blue color that is reminiscent of the non-photo blue used in traditional pencil and paper art. In the following screenshot, the pencil layer has been turned blue:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_06_6.33.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.33: Sketch turned blue</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="3">To change <a id="_idIndexMarker518"/>the color <a id="_idIndexMarker519"/>of the layer, click on the blue rectangle that will now appear in the <strong class="screenText">Layer Property</strong> palette. This will bring up the color picker. You can select any color from the color picker to use as the layer color.</li>
<li class="numberedList">In the screenshot on the right, we can see that our colored layer is easy to discern in the list of layers because of the icon that shows above the layer’s name. Look for this icon if you have lots of layers and need to find the one that has been colored:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_06_6.34.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.34: Layer palette</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="5">With the <strong class="screenText">Layer Color</strong> option active, any new marks made on this layer will show up in <a id="_idIndexMarker520"/>the layer <a id="_idIndexMarker521"/>color. In the following screenshot, an inking pen tool has been used to make a mark on the sketch layer. Since the marks are blue, we know that we are still on the pencil layer and not on the ink layer:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_06_6.35.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.35: Inking on the sketch layer</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="6">Select the <strong class="screenText">Inks</strong> layer in the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette, above the <strong class="screenText">Finished pencils</strong> layer, and begin inking. The ink lines will now have the currently selected color in the toolbar instead of using the layer color. In the following screenshot, the ink line is black because we are on the correct layer:</li>

<p class="normal">This is such <a id="_idIndexMarker522"/>a simple <a id="_idIndexMarker523"/>solution to a common digital art problem, and a useful feature that I hope you’ll incorporate into your own workflow!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-137">Summary</h1>
