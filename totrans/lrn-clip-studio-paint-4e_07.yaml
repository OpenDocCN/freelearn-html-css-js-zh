- en: One of the brilliant things about manga and comic creations is you can make
    your characters have dialog! Lettering for this media can be a complex and nuanced
    topic that could fill an entire book of its own. The rules and conventions for
    lettering a comic are varied, and lettering in and of itself is a skill that takes
    lots of time and practice to master. Back in the days before computers, a comic
    would have a dedicated letterer who would draw all the dialog boxes, balloons,
    and words by hand using various tools. Thankfully, we can use Clip Studio Paint
    and the fonts installed on our computer to handle lettering, rather than having
    to draw every letter on our own!

    how to apply it using the Text and Balloon tools in Clip Studio Paint. Since Clip
    Studio is made for comic book artists, it naturally has tools to make the creation
    of speech balloons easy, as well as tools to create different balloon tails, and
    more.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before we learn how to create speech bubbles, let’s think a little about where
    to place them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is important to consider speech bubbles and text boxes as part of a manga
    panel and its composition on a page. Even as early as the sketching stage, we
    need to think of these elements as part of the composition along with the characters
    and environment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This means that, first of all, the text (and the panels they are a part of)
    must be in an order that’s easy to follow. This may seem obvious, but it makes
    a big difference to how people read your comic. Who is replying to who? Are the
    characters speaking before, during, or after the action shown in the artwork?
    Is it clear, from one panel to another, how much time has passed? Reading is,
    after all, a linear experience, and it’s important that we handle the flow of
    information to the reader effectively.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Perhaps more important, though, is to consider the impact of text boxes and
    balloons on a composition as a whole. The text must be placed *around* the center
    of the piece, rather than in the middle of it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'With these two aspects in mind – the sequence of the dialog and its incorporation
    into the composition – we should look at some examples. The following samples
    show text in a Western comic on the left and Japanese manga on the right:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can see from these examples that the placement of text boxes is influenced
    by the direction of reading – from left to right in the Western comic and from
    right to left in the Japanese manga. In both cases, the boxes generally flow from
    top to bottom and are near the character who is speaking. In neither case, however,
    do they overlap with important parts of the art piece.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generally, text boxes are for announcements and speech balloons are for character
    dialog. For example, you may have seen text boxes used to announce details like
    the passage of time from one panel to another. As we can see in the left example,
    announcements about the passage of time are typically placed in the corners of
    the composition.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Speech balloons can be created using different shapes, depending on the tones
    and pacing of the dialog. In the previous examples, the character’s pondering
    in the Western comic is shown with round bubbles with small tails. In comparison,
    the action-packed manga uses zig-zagging shapes and larger text.

    need to use the following settings to deal with them. Any settings I think important
    are marked as **Important**, which are **Font**, **Font size**, **Alignmen**t,
