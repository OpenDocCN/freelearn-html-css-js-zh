    you may be hacked. Even if you do everything right, you may be hacked. So it's
    important you understand the common security mechanisms to avoid exposing your
    website to vulnerabilities, and also, always follow the recommended practices
    and methodologies that have been largely tested and proven to be robust.

    means you should never use in a production system any kind of crypto algorithm
    or security model that you developed by yourself. Always use solutions that have
    been highly used, tested, and recommended by trusted sources. Even experienced
    people may commit errors and expose a solution to attacks, especially in the cryptography
    field, which requires advanced math. However, when a proposed solution is analyzed
    and tested by a great number of specialists, errors are much less frequent.'

- en: In the security world, there is a term called **security through obscurity**.
    It is defined as a security model where the implementation mechanism is not publicly
    known, so there is a belief that it is secure because no one has prior information
    about the flaws it has. It can be indeed secure, but if used as the only form
    of protection, it is considered as a poor security practice. If a hacker is persistent
    enough, he or she can discover flaws even without knowing the internal code. In
    this case again, it's better to use a highly tested algorithm than your own.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Security through obscurity can be compared to someone trying to protect their
    own money by burying it in the backyard when the common security mechanism would
    be to put the money in a bank. The money can be safe while buried, but it will
    be protected only until someone finds about its existence and starts to look for
    it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Due to this reason, when dealing with security, we usually prefer to use open
    source algorithms and tools. Everyone can access and discover flaws in them, but
    there are also a great number of specialists that are involved in finding the
    vulnerabilities and fixing them.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Authentication
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Authentication is the ability to confirm the user's identity. It can be implemented
    by a login form where you request the user to type their username and password.
    If the hashed password matches what was previously saved in the database, you
    have enough proof that the user is who they claim to be. This model is good enough,
    at least for typical applications. You confirm the identity by requesting the
    user to provide what *they know*. Another kind of authentication is to request
    the user to provide what *they have*. It can be a physical device (like a dongle)
    or access to an e-mail account or phone number.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, you can't ask the user to type their credentials for *every* request.
    As long as you *authenticate* it in the first request, you must create a security
    token that will be used in the subsequent requests. This token will be saved on
    the client side as a cookie and will be automatically sent to the server in all requests.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On AWS, this token can be created using the Cognito service. How this is done
    will be described later in this chapter.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Authorization
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When a request is received in the backend, we need to check if the user is allowed
    to execute the requested action. For example, if the user wants to checkout the
    order with ID `123`, we need to make a query to the database to identify who is
    the owner of the order and compare if it is the same user.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another scenario is when we have multiple roles in an application and we need
    to restrict data access. For example, a system developed to manage school grades
    may be implemented with two roles, such as `student` and `teacher`. The teacher
    will access the system to insert or update grades, while the students will access
    the system to read those grades. In this case, the authentication system must
    restrict the actions *insert* and *update* for users that are part of the *teachers*
    group and users in the *students* group must be restricted to *read* their own
    grades.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most of the time, we handle authorization in our own backend, but some serverless
    services don't require a backend and they are responsible by themselves to properly
    check the authorization. For example, in the next chapter, we are going to see
    how serverless notifications are implemented on AWS. When we use AWS IoT, if we
    want a private channel of communication between two users, we must give them access
    to one specific resource known by both and restrict access to other users to avoid
    the disclosure of private messages. This kind of authorization will be detailed
    in the next chapter.

- en: In [Chapter 4](274d8aba-8e7e-4c5e-b55b-a8e1797d3057.xhtml), *Hosting the Website*,
    we learned how to use AWS Certificate Manager to request TLS certificates for
    free and how to add them to CloudFront distributions. Developing a website that
    uses HTTPS for *all* requests is the main drive to achieve confidentiality in
    the communication between the users and your site. As the data is encrypted, it's
    very hard for malicious users to decrypt and understand its contents.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although there are some attacks that can intercept the communication and forge
    certificates (man-in-the-middle), those require the malicious user to have access
    to the machine or network of the victim user. From our side, adding HTTPS support
    is the best thing that we can do to minimize the chance of attacks.
  prefs: []

- en: Integrity
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Integrity is related to confidentiality. While confidentiality relies on encrypting
    a message to prevent other users from accessing its contents, integrity deals
    with protecting the messages against modifications by encrypting messages with
    digital signatures (TLS certificates).
  prefs: []

- en: Non-repudiation
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Non-repudiation is a term that is often confused with authentication since both
    of them have the objective to prove who has sent the message. However, the main
    difference is that authentication is more interested in a technical view and the
    non-repudiation concept is interested in legal terms, liability, and auditing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you have a login form with user and password input, you can authenticate
    the user who correctly knows the combination, but you can't have 100% certain
    since the credentials can be correctly guessed or stolen by a third-party. On
    the other hand, if you have a stricter access mechanism, such as a biometric entry,
    you have more credibility. However, this is not perfect either. It's just a better
    non-repudiation mechanism.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Availability is also a concept of interest in the information security field
    because availability is not restricted to how you provision your hardware to meet
    your user needs. Availability can suffer attacks and can suffer interruptions
    due to malicious users. There are attacks, such as **Distributed Denial of Service**
    (**DDoS**), that aim to create bottlenecks to disrupt site availability. In a
    DDoS attack, the targeted website is flooded with superfluous requests with the
    objective to overload the systems. This is usually accomplished by a controlled
    network of infected machines called a **botnet**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On AWS, all services run under the AWS Shield service, which was designed to
    protect against DDoS attacks with no additional charge. However, if you run a
    very large and important service, you may be a direct target of advanced and large
    DDoS attacks. In this case, there is a premium tier offered in the AWS Shield
    service to ensure your website's availability even in worst case scenarios. This
    requires an investment of US$ 3,000 per month, and with this, you will have 24x7
    support of a dedicated team and access to other tools for mitigation and analysis
    of DDoS attacks.
