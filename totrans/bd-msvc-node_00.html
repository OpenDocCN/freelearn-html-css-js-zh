			<p>Microservices are a popular architectural style for building scalable, resilient, and adaptable applications. They allow developers to decompose a complex system into smaller, independent, and loosely coupled services that communicate through well-defined interfaces. Microservices enable faster delivery, easier testing, and greater flexibility in choosing the right technologies for each service.</p>
			<p>Node.js is a powerful and versatile platform for building microservices. It offers a fast and lightweight runtime environment, a rich set of libraries and frameworks, and a vibrant and supportive community. Node.js enables developers to write microservices in JavaScript, a ubiquitous and expressive language that runs on any platform. Node.js also supports asynchronous and event-driven programming, which is essential for handling concurrent requests and building reactive systems.</p>
			<p>This book is a comprehensive guide to building microservices with Node.js. It covers the concepts, principles, and best practices of microservice architecture, as well as the tools and techniques for designing, developing, testing, deploying, and monitoring Node.js microservices. It also provides practical examples and case studies of real-world microservice applications built with Node.js.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is intended for developers who have some experience with Node.js and want to learn how to build microservice applications with it. It assumes that you are familiar with the basics of Node.js, such as modules, callbacks, promises, and events. It also assumes that you have some knowledge of web development, such as HTTP, REST, JSON, and HTML. However, you do not need to be an expert in any of these topics, as the book will explain them as needed.</p>
