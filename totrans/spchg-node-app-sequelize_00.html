<p>From idling on the runway to flying in the skies, this book will introduce you to the world of corresponding with a database for a Node.js application using Sequelize and MySQL, from generating a schema and fitted for an airline agency to deploying a web application for booking flights in the cloud.</p>
<p>Concepts such as event life cycles, associations, transactions, and pooling connections are covered to get you from start to finish when working on your next application. By the end of this book, you will be proficient and confident in creating, removing, and transforming data between a database management system and a Node.js application using Sequelize.</p>
