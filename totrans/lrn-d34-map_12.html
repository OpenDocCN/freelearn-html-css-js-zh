                    <h1 class="header-title">Publishing Your Visualization with Github Pages</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Once done with the hard work of creating your visualization, you should show it to the world, and the internet seems the perfect place for that.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you will learn how to publish your visualization online. There are several ways to do so, stretching from simple command line one-liners using your machine as a server, to full-fledged hosting services that require you to build and deploy a server yourself. We will focus on a simple, fast and convenient way—<strong>GitHub Pages</strong>. Here’s what we will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get an understanding of Git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages</li>
<li>Create a GitHub repository with your files and folders</li>
<li>Upload your files to GitHub and edit them for publishing</li>
<li>Publish your visualization on GitHub Pages</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all easy steps, no matter whether you are a seasoned Git and GitHub user or if you have just started out. Let’s dive into it.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">What we will publish</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>First, you need something to publish. Let’s assume that after mapping so many earthly things, you were reaching for outer space—mapping our solar system:</p>
<div><img src="img/b9d10ab8-3739-40a8-a02e-3de166cd7333.png"/></div>
<p>Planets in pink</p>
<p>This visual shows all planets of our solar system in a row, ordered from left to right by their distance to the sun and showing their scaled sizes in relation to each other. It also shows the sun (not a planet, but a star) and Pluto (officially, a dwarf planet).</p>
<p>So, at this stage, you have a visualization in an HTML file or in a set of files stitched together in an HTML or JavaScript file; that's all you need. Your published work is just a few clicks away, thanks to how simple GitHub Pages makes the process.</p>
<div><p>Feel free to take a peek at the GitHub account we will set up, including the code at <a href="https://github.com/GoodToBeHere/pink-planets">https://github.com/GoodToBeHere/pink-planets</a> as well as the published visual at <a href="https://goodtobehere.github.io/pink-planets/">https://goodtobehere.github.io/pink-planets/</a> or at <a href="http://planetsin.pink/">planetsin.pink/</a>.</p>
</div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Understanding the type of content you can publish</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Before we jump into it, let's briefly consider what type of content GitHub Pages can host. In short, GitHub Pages will let you serve any <strong>static web page</strong> or pages with <strong>dynamic client-side scripting</strong>. If you want to host projects with dynamic server-side scripting, you might want to opt for a different setup, for example, <strong>Heroku</strong>.</p>
<p>In simple terms, static or flat web pages consist of a set of files—or at least a single HTML file that serves the same content to every user. If you want to change the content, you need to change the source code.</p>
<p>Dynamic web pages consist of a set of files that await external requests or inputs to then build, change, and serve the content on the fly. They might show different contents for different users, or for different times of the day or operating systems.</p>
<p>There are two types of dynamic web pages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web pages with <strong>client-side scripting</strong> usually use JavaScript and its derivatives to translate user input to a changed DOM structure. It does so <em>client-side</em>, which means that it happens entirely within the bounds of the browser.</li>
<li>Web pages with <strong>server-side scripting</strong> require input parameters passed all the way to the application’s server. Server-side languages such as PHP, Python, Node.js, or the like assemble the page content in a situation-bespoke way, often with information retrieved from databases.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, you can host your project on GitHub Pages if it’s not dependent on server-side scripting. You can facilitate user input as long as it happens within the bounds of the client. You can join and update all data that comes from a flat file stored as such on your GitHub page. This can be a <kbd>.csv</kbd> or otherwise delimited data file, but you can’t connect to, for example, a relational SQL database (which relies on structured interrelationships). You can, of course, calculate and recalculate data, as long as it happens client-side.</p>
<p>It is important to be aware of this limitation in order to choose the right hosting technology to publish your visualization. However, many D3 projects in the wild can be hosted as static web pages or dynamic pages with exclusive client-side scripting.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Hosting your code on GitHub</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this section, we’ll set you up for the publishing of your visual. We’ll explain a few key terms that will help understand GitHub and its purpose; we create an account, upload our content, and prepare it for publishing. This will be a gentle introduction to GitHub. If you already have an account and know about repositories, committing, pulling, pushing, merging, and branches feel free to jump on to the <em>Publishing your project on GitHub Pages</em> section.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Making sense of some key terms and concepts</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="mce-root">Let’s look at some terminology first. If you are a seasoned Git or GitHub user, feel free to skip this introduction.</p>
<div><p>This is a very high-level introduction to Git and GitHub, and by no means complete. If you want to learn more about Git, I recommend reading the excellent documentation at <a href="https://git-scm.com/">https://git-scm.com/</a>. If you want to know more about GitHub, <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/</a> is a great place to start.</p>
</div>
<p>Git is a <strong>distributed version control system</strong>. Let’s break that down. <strong>Version control</strong> of a file (usually a text file such as a <kbd>.html</kbd> or <kbd>.js</kbd> file) just means keeping track of all the changes made to the file. Before you can use it, you need to download, install, and initialize it in the folder you would like to track files in. Git has three core concepts that make your coding life easier.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Tracking historic changes of your files</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Once initialized in a folder, Git allows you to save or <strong>commit</strong> a file to that folder after you changed it. Without Git, you might stoop to making explicit copies of a file you’re working on and misusing its name to represent the version such as <kbd>myFile-v01.html</kbd> and <kbd>myFile-v02.html</kbd>. Instead, Git will assign a commit ID to each commit. Going back through all your commits is easy; just open or check out the version you would like to see. Usually, you don’t just version control a single file but many files living in different project folders. The root folder of all the key files you want to version control, the one you initialized Git in, is called the Git <strong>repository</strong>.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Collaborating on a project</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="mce-root">The big advantage of Git, as compared to its predecessors, is that it is distributed. It allows many people to access the same project files and each person with granted access sees the full history of versions for each file. It is made for collaboration. To share a repository, it needs to be accessible by some sort of network, for example, the internet. This is where GitHub comes into play.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Assuming that you start a project with the bold goal of visualizing our solar system, you can start coding on your own. You create your own local repository and add and commit the files you want to track in the repository. A few days and many commits later, you realize that this is much too large a task for you to pull off alone. You invite friends to help you. In order to work on the code base together, you upload all your files to GitHub and tie it to your local repository via Git. Git now knows that there is a local repository of your project and a remote repository mirroring the local repository.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Once you have made changes to a file locally and committed them, you can overwrite the same file on the remote GitHub repository by <strong>push</strong>ing this file up. Your friends can <strong>pull</strong> the changes you made down to their local machines and see the exact same files you see, including the file with the changes you just made and all changes made previously.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Working on project branches</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>You can also maintain parallel <strong>branches</strong> of your project. Each branch is a copy of your project.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Imagine that you have a production version of your project that lives on a website visited by millions of people each day. This production version will be your <strong>master branch</strong>. Now you want to add a new feature; for example, a button that changes the planets’ color from pink to purple. You don’t want to develop this feature in the production version. This can be dangerous as things might break and your millions of visitors might turn away in disgust. So, you create a copy of your project—a branch you might call the <em>purple</em> bra<em>nch</em>. You can now merrily develop locally, commit different versions of it, and make and fix mistakes. You can push your changes up to GitHub to collaborate with your friends until it works, is tested, and makes you happy. Then, you copy all changes from the <em>purple</em> branch to the <em>master</em> branch, or better expressed in Git-terminology: you <strong>merge</strong> the purple branch into the master branch.</p>
<p>As said, this can only be a quick tour past the bare bones of Git and GitHub. There’s surely more, but being comfortable with these key concepts and terms, you can now confidently set up yourself and your project on GitHub.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Setting up a GitHub account</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>As setting up an online account is something you have probably done a lot of times in your life, we won’t spend much time on this. Here we go:</p>
<div><img height="380" width="1064" src="img/22b4086e-691e-4227-b433-b0080388f7c5.png"/></div>
<p>Setting up a GitHub account</p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a>, click on <strong>Sign in</strong>, and follow the steps. We express our generally positive attitude to GitHub by choosing the Username <kbd>GoodToBeHere</kbd> and enter our email address and a Password. On the second screen, we opt for the free account and, after answering a few optional questions on the third screen, we complete our signup.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Creating a repository</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Next, we want to set up a repository. Remember that a repository is the root folder of your project holding all your files and folders. There are two ways to create this repository on GitHub:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can push up a local repository—a project folder on your local machine</li>
<li>You can create a new repository online via GitHub</li>
</ul>
<p>In this chapter, we will only look at the second way and do everything online.</p>
<div><p>It makes sense to connect your project to GitHub via the command line if you are working continuously with Git and GitHub. It only requires basic familiarity with the command line, and you can learn more about it at <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/">https://help.github<em>.com</em>/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>After setting up your account, you will be directed to your very own GitHub dashboard, as you can see in the URL:</p>
<div><img height="457" width="768" src="img/62f695cc-f087-452e-8467-6e2cefe538b3.png"/></div>
<p>Your GitHub dashboard</p>
<p>To create a new repository, click on New repository.</p>
<p>Considering the next screenshot, we will first name our repository. All your repositories will be owned by you, so they will all start with your username. Each repository needs to have a unique name within your list of repositories. For now, you are pretty flexible as this is your first and only repository so far. We’ll appropriately call our repository <kbd>pink-planets</kbd>, avoiding any spaces in the name:</p>
<div><img height="655" width="733" src="img/bef6f303-8c15-4c3b-b9ac-8e005326155c.png"/></div>
<p>Creating a repository</p>
<p>All our repositories will be Public, which means that everyone can see all your code! If you would like or need to keep your code private, you can opt for a paid personal plan.</p>
<p>It’s a good practice to initialize the repository with a <kbd>README</kbd> file, which allows a description of your project. Don’t worry about the <kbd>.gitignore</kbd> file, we won’t need it here. Lastly, we add a license, in our case, an Apache License 2.0. There are several licenses you can choose from, and it’s a good idea to make yourself acquainted with the options here.</p>
<p>Lastly, we hit the big green Create repository button, which does exactly that and brings us straight to the repository’s page:</p>
<div><img height="575" width="818" src="img/280cad99-6f50-4c59-9dce-72fcc2f153bc.png"/></div>
<p>Our repository’s page</p>
<p>You can see the name of your repository, a control bar with several tabs displaying the contents of the Code tab in focus, and a quick description. Next, there’s a bar showing you some general information such as how many commits (or file saves) have been done, how many branches (or project copies) this repository boasts, how many releases there are, and how many contributors have access to this repository.</p>
<p>After the row of button controls, we have a folder view of all files and folders in our repository. Currently, there are only the two files we just created: the <kbd>LICENSE</kbd> and the <kbd>README.md</kbd> file; <kbd>.md</kbd> stands for <strong>markdown</strong>, which allows you to format text files with a simple syntax. You can learn the gist of it within a few minutes at, for example, <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/</a>.</p>
<p>At the bottom, you see the contents of the <kbd>README</kbd> file, giving visitors or collaborators a quick summary of what your project is about.</p>
<p>It’s still a little bland, so let’s change it and, at the same time, learn how to edit a file via GitHub.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Editing a file on GitHub</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>If you want to edit a file, you first need to click on its link in your repository. Next, you click on the Edit this file pencil in the upper-right corner:</p>
<div><img height="343" width="522" src="img/790d7b46-6bcb-40d4-8f9c-1a66923687f3.png"/></div>
<p>Opening a file for edit</p>
<p>This will direct you to an editable view of the file. In here, you can change the name of the file above the editor window (we leave that as we’re happy with <kbd>README.md</kbd> as a name), and you can change the file’s content in the Edit file view:</p>
<div><img height="322" width="943" src="img/93bc1d88-95a6-4738-8fc8-5ca5aeaef2f9.png"/></div>
<p>Changing the README.md file</p>
<p>We’ve only done a few changes here: we capitalized the title and added some text to describe what the project is about. We’re using markdown syntax to mark the headline as headline 1 with the <kbd>#</kbd> before the text. We also use markdown to print <kbd>sun</kbd> in bold with the prepending and trailing asterisks. The great thing about markdown files is that we can also use normal HTML tags for styling, as we do here with the word <kbd>dwarfed</kbd><em>—</em>writing it in subscript.</p>
<p>Once done with our edits, we can change from the Edit file tab to the Preview changes tab and see what we’ve done. The preview marks our changes clearly with coloring and strike-through:</p>
<div><img height="636" width="727" src="img/10a92c3e-5afb-498e-8888-4af87ec2c8be.png"/></div>
<p>Previewing our changes</p>
<p>We now want to save these changes, which, in Git's language, means <strong>commit</strong>. We can do this with the big green button at the bottom. However, before we do so, we have to add a commit message consisting of a mandatory short summary line and an optional extended description. We can add those to the text fields under Commit changes. Think of the commit summary line as an email title and the extended description as the email body.</p>
<p>A good commit summary line is short (less than 70 characters) and completes the sentence <em>This commit will…</em>, summarizing concisely what the changes include. GitHub is so kind as to offer us a predefined description depending on the changes we made. In this case, it offers us Update README.md, which we’re perfectly happy with, so we won’t change it. We’ll leave the optional extended description field blank, and click on Commit changes.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Uploading files to the repository</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Let’s now upload our project files and folders. Back on our repository page, we find the Upload files button:</p>
<div><img height="462" width="547" src="img/3d31e71c-d58a-4b06-bcbf-fb7bfc5e7a38.png"/></div>
<p>Uploading files</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT">We get to an upload field and drag all our project files over, like this:</p>
<div><img height="379" width="839" src="img/c95c1668-df42-4910-a82c-d3eed5ac0d7c.png"/></div>
<p>Dragging our files to upload</p>
<p>Our project consists of four files in three folders. We have a <kbd>planets.html</kbd> file in the root directory, three folders called <kbd>/css</kbd>, <kbd>/data</kbd>, and <kbd>/js</kbd> containing the <kbd>planets.css</kbd>, <kbd>planets.csv</kbd> and <kbd>planets.js</kbd> files. We just grab them from our folder and drag them over.</p>
<div><img height="538" width="618" src="img/d99a0ba6-ec44-42f0-bf41-4b0f3ec22f26.png"/></div>
<p>Committing our project files and folders</p>
<p>Once uploaded, we need to commit our changes. We add a short commit message summary and click on Commit changes.</p>
<p>We’ll be redirected to the repository page and can see all our uploaded files:</p>
<div><img height="619" width="716" src="img/7580a636-0193-4ccb-973b-ae2348e6830f.png"/></div>
<p>The repository with all our project files</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Publishing your project on GitHub Pages</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Great, you have your project on GitHub. It doesn’t get any more complex. You’re just two small preparations and a few clicks away from having your project online!</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Preparing the files for publishing</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Before we can click on that publish button, we need to ensure that your files are interlinked in the right way, and that your main HTML file is called <kbd>index.html</kbd>.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Keeping your paths absolute</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>First, let’s check all our file references. There are two links from within our HTML file, one to our <kbd>.css</kbd> file and one to our <kbd>.js</kbd> file:</p>
<div><img height="676" width="798" src="img/03061ce8-853f-4112-ac9b-c8f59a6db320.png"/></div>
<p>Correct links within the HTML file</p>
<p>All paths on GitHub can be referenced as absolute paths pointing to the root directory. This saves you from working out the relative path from any file at any depth of your directory tree. However, it also means that you might have to change relative paths from your local directory to root-based absolute paths. Your HTML file <kbd>planets.html</kbd> (we will change this to <kbd>index.html</kbd> in the next step) lives in the root directory. Both the <kbd>css</kbd> and <kbd>js</kbd> folders are also saved in the root directory, so the two paths are absolute to root and will work locally as well as in GitHub.</p>
<p>However, in our project, we’re also referencing the <kbd>data/planets.csv</kbd> file from the <kbd>js/planets.js</kbd> file. Locally, you may reference this as a relative path, first moving up a level with <kbd>../</kbd> as in <kbd>'../data/planets.csv'</kbd>. However, in GitHub, the following will work:</p>
<div><img height="430" width="479" src="img/48bf7bec-46ea-4d24-80bf-6b079eddb9e8.png"/></div>
<p>An absolute path used within a nested file</p>
<p>In short, you can always use absolute paths relative to root within your GitHub project.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Changing the main HTML filename to index.html</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Your main HTML file might already be called <kbd>index.html</kbd>. If it’s not, just go to the file and rename it to <kbd>index.html</kbd>, as follows:</p>
<div><img src="img/a09ed18f-716e-458d-a317-07a0e3f57008.png"/></div>
<p>Ensuring that our main HTML file is called <strong>index.html</strong></p>
<p>Well done, that’s all the preparation required. Now, let’s publish!</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Publishing your project</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>After all that, erm, hard work, you deserve a simple process to publish. Well, you are exactly five clicks away from viewing your project online. Here they are:</p>
<p>1. Click on the Settings tab from your repository home page:</p>
<div><img height="632" width="374" src="img/34bf895c-e6eb-4495-9a4f-ac61cae97a65.png"/></div>
<p>Your repository settings</p>
<p>2. Navigate to the GitHub Pages area and expand the drop-down menu in the Source field:</p>
<div><img height="581" width="742" src="img/9592f97b-5faa-4ebd-83f9-882a304fb9a6.png"/></div>
<p>You are nearly there</p>
<p>3. Choose the master branch to publish from (we didn’t create any other branches, so this is the one) and 4. click on Save.</p>
<p>Next, you will see the following message offering you a link to your online project:</p>
<div><img height="165" width="478" src="img/91640700-0595-44ca-bf10-50065e17cdb6.png"/></div>
<p>Just one more click!</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT">5. Click it! It might take a moment for the project to take its rightful place, so you might want to wait a painful minute, but eventually, it will be published:</p>
<div><img height="424" width="860" src="img/3c9c90b1-fc15-4753-bfb0-76b8d7ee4c3d.png"/></div>
<p>Your published work</p>
<p>Marvelous! Your work is published, and the rest is history! Congratulations.</p>
<p>Our URL is <a href="https://goodtobehere.github.io/pink-planets/">https://goodtobehere.github.io/pink-planets/</a>, or more generally, <kbd>https://&lt;your username&gt;.github.io/&lt;the repository’s name&gt;</kbd>. Although this is a logical construct, it might appear a little clunky. You can change it to a custom URL, like we did in our example:</p>
<div><img height="328" width="619" src="img/bc37aa2a-fb49-4229-94a5-c3adc230955b.png"/></div>
<p>A custom domain</p>
<p>It will require you to use a domain you have secured with the DNS Provider of your choice, and change a few settings on the DNS Provider side as well as, in some cases, on GitHub, but it’s also a simple process that you might want to consider.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this chapter, you learned how to publish your visualization, or in fact any project, on GitHub Pages. You learned what type of pages you can and can’t publish on GitHub Pages. You glimpsed the powers of Git and the merits of GitHub before using it as a home for your code. After minor tweaking and prepping, you eventually published your project online. One way to look at this feat is that your project now claims the same online real estate as any other page on the web, which is something to build upon.</p>
