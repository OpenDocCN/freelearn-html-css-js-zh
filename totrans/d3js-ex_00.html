There are literally thousands of examples online with differing degrees of effective, or ineffective, explanation.</p><p>This book uses examples that take you right from the beginning, with the basic concepts of D3.js, using practical examples that progressively build on each other both within a specific chapter and also with reference to previous chapters.</p><p>We will focus on the examples created for this book as well as those found online that are excellent but could use some additional explanation. Each example will explain how the example works either line by line or by comparison with other examples and concepts learned earlier in the book.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "Now using the selector variable we call the <code class="literal">.enter()</code> function and assign it to a variable named <code class="literal">entering</code>."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">&lt;div id='div1'&gt;A&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id='div2'&gt;B&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id='div3'&gt;C&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id='div4'&gt;D&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
    var selector = d3.select('body')
                     .selectAll('div');
&lt;/script&gt;</pre></div><p> When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">function render(dataToRender) {
    var selector = d3.select('body')
        .selectAll('div')
        .data(dataToRender);

<strong>    var entering = selector.enter();</strong>
    entering.append('div')
        .text(function(d) { return d; });
} </pre></div><p>
<strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "The value for <strong>Mikael</strong> was changed to <strong>25.</strong>"</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip01"/>Tip</h3><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p></div></div></div>
