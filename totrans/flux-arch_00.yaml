- en: I love Backbone.js. It's an amazing little library that does so much with so
    little. It's also unopinionated—there are endless ways to do the same thing. This
    last point gives many Backbone.js programmers a headache. The freedom to implement
    things the way we see fit is great, until we start making those unavoidable consistency
    errors.

- en: When I first started with Flux, I couldn't really see how such an architecture
    could help out a mere Backbone.js programmer. Eventually, I figured out two things.
    First, Flux is unopinionated where it matters—the implementation specifics. Two,
    Flux is very much like Backbone in the spirit of minimal moving parts that do
    one thing well.

- en: As I started experimenting with Flux, I realized that Flux provides the missing
    architectural perspective that enables scalability. Where Backbone.js and other
    related technologies fall apart is when something goes wrong. In fact, these bugs
    can be so difficult that they're never actually fixed—the whole system is scarred
    with workarounds.

    of JavaScript, can experience the same level of enlightenment as I have working
    with this wonderful technology from Facebook.
