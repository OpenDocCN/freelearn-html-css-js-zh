<p><strong>JavaScript Fatigue</strong> was a trendy term back in 2016, a time when new libraries and frameworks emerged on a daily basis. This promoted diversity, but also crippled developers with too many options. Even today, developers are expected to have experience working with <span><strong>build tools</strong>, <strong>linters</strong>, <strong>testing frameworks</strong>, <strong>assertion libraries</strong>, <strong>package managers</strong>, <strong>module loaders</strong>, <strong>module bundlers</strong>, <strong>routers</strong>, <strong>web servers</strong>, <strong>compilers</strong>, <strong>transpilers</strong>, <strong>static typecheckers</strong>, <strong>virtual DOM</strong> libraries, <strong>state management</strong> tools, <strong>CSS preprocessors</strong> and <strong>UI Frameworks</strong> (I've probably missed a few).</span></p>
<p><span>No wonder people find it difficult to get started, or even keep up, with JavaScript. </span><span>Many have spent days learning a dozen different tools just to set up their project. And that's before they write a single line of code! </span></p>
<p><span>Nonetheless, this boom in diversity does bring tangible benefits—it pulls us away from</span> <span>opinionated</span><span> frameworks and allows us to tailor our application as a composite of many smaller modules. </span><span>Therefore, i</span>nstead of bemoaning the state of the ecosystem, we should spend the time to learn each tool.</p>
<p>If that sounds like a tortuous undertaking, then <span>this book will save you a lot of time.</span></p>
<p><span>Whilst most programming books tod</span><span>ay examine a single framework, library, or language in great detail, t</span><span>his book provides you with a solid foundation on a wide range of tools and practices commonly used in enterprise environments. </span><span>Each of them contributes to building a reliable, production-ready application. In other words, we focus on <em>breadth</em> over <em>depth</em>.</span></p>
<p><span>We also value structure over chaos; as such, there's a heavy emphasis on establishing <strong>best practices</strong>, following <strong>processes</strong>, <strong>testing</strong>, <strong>infrastructure</strong>, and <strong>automation</strong>. If these words whet your appetite, then this book is perfect for you.</span></p>

<p><span>Traditionally, most tech companies followed a horizontal structure, where development, testing, and operations are separated into different departments. Since they are interdependent, every team can only work at the pace of the slowest team.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><span>In recent years, however, we have seen a shift towards </span><strong>vertical</strong><span> </span><strong>teams</strong><span>. Vertical teams are formed based on project requirements, where each team is responsible for all stages of the process—from gathering requirements to deployment. This allows teams to take <em>full</em> ownership of the entire feature, as they become self-reliant and can move at their own pace. Consequently, many companies require their developers to command </span>a broad skillset.</p>
<p>Therefore, this book is not just written for JavaScript developers who are eager to learn new tools, but for all developers who wish to stay relevant in today's job market.</p>

<p>Unlike online blogs and websites, physical books have a page limit. Consequently, we had to be rigorous in our choice of tools to include. In the end, we hand-selected tools and frameworks based on two criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>It must be commonly encountered in <span>an enterprise environment.</span></li>
<li><span>It must have a high likelihood of remaining relevant for a long time (no hype-driven development!).</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>This narrowed down the list to these tools—Git, npm, yarn, Babel, ESLint, Cucumber, Mocha, Istanbul/NYC, Selenium, OpenAPI/Swagger, Express, Elasticsearch, React, Redux, Webpack, Travis, Jenkins, NGINX, Linux, PM2, Docker, and Kubernetes. </span>We will utilize these tools to build a simple, but robust, user directory application that consists of a backend API and a frontend web user interface (UI).</p>
<p>This book is divided into five sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapters 1 to 3 – Overview of theories and practices that provide the context for the rest of the book</li>
<li>Chapters 4 to 13 – Developing a backend API</li>
<li>Chapters 14 to 16 – Developing a frontend web application that links up with the API</li>
<li>Chapters 17 to 18 – Deploying our services on<span> a scalable infrastructure using Docker and Kubernetes</span></li>
<li>Chapters 19 to 20 – Explaining important JavaScript concepts and syntax</li>
</ul>

<p>As you may appreciate, by covering all these tools in a single book, it's impossible to<span> examine any of them in great detail. Thus, we've selected the most fundamental concepts to cover, leaving </span><span>the finer details to more advanced books.</span></p>
<p><span>There were also topics that we wanted to include but simply did not have the page count to do so. Notably, these important concepts are <em>not</em> covered:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Static type checking with TypeScript or Flow</span></li>
<li><span>Configuration management with Puppet/Ansible</span></li>
<li>Monitoring and visualizing metrics using Prometheus and Grafana</li>
<li>Distributed logging using Logstash/Kafka</li>

                    <h1 class="header-title">To get the most out of this book</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p><span>We've structured this book so that each chapter builds on the previous one. As such, this book is meant to be read in a sequential manner.</span></p>
<p><span>This book focuses on the tools and frameworks in the JavaScript ecosystem,</span><span> not on </span><span>the JavaScript language itself</span><span>. Therefore, I'd expect readers of this book to have a basic understanding of the JavaScript syntax.</span></p>
<p>Before we introduce each tool, <span>we'll try to answer the following questions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>What problems is it trying to solve?</span></li>
<li>How does it work under the hood?</li>
<li><span>Why did we pick this tool over its alternatives?</span></li>
</ul>
<p>You should consider this book as a learning exercise, rather than a reference manual. <span>We want you to understand <em>why</em> a tool is needed</span><span>, and not just copy-and-paste sample code into your terminal or editor. Ergo, there will be instances where we implement a feature in a sub-optimal way, only to improve it at a later date.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root">We also expect you to get hands-on and write a lot of the code yourself. In many parts of the book, we will teach you the required concepts, guide you through a few examples, and leave you to implement the rest. We strongly encourage you to use this opportunity to practice what you've learned; however, if you ever get stuck, or are eager to move on to the next chapter, you can always refer to the code bundle that comes with the book.</p>
<p><span>Due to the fast-changing nature of the ecosystem, many tools will inevitably introduce breaking changes after the publication of this book. As a result, some of the instructions may not work as described. In those cases, you should read the release notes or migration guide published by the tool's author; alternatively, you may search for help on the internet and Q&amp;A sites. On our end, we will try to maintain up-to-date package versions and instructions in our code bundle, which is hosted on GitHub.</span></p>
<p>The instructions in this book are intended to run on a machine running GNU/Linux, specifically Ubuntu 18.04. Readers using other operating systems should still be able to follow along but may require more effort in setting up and debugging. Readers using Windows machines should set up their computers to dual boot Ubuntu and Windows; you can find detailed instructions at <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot">help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot</a>. Alternatively, if you're using Windows 10, you can install <strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux</strong> (<strong>WSL</strong>), which allows you to natively run command-line tools and applications you'd normally expect to see in GNU/Linux. You can find detailed instructions at <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/">docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, this book is the <span>culmination of a 16-month journey. I have learned a lot along the way, and have also gained a few gray hairs. I hope you enjoy reading this book as much as I've enjoyed writing it!</span></p>
