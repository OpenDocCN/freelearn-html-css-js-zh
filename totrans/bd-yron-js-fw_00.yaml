- en: This book is about crafting, understanding, and maintaining JavaScript frameworks
    – the critical building blocks of many modern web applications. The ecosystem
    of software frameworks, particularly JavaScript ones, has been highly interesting
    for many developers in the past 10-plus years. In addition, JavaScript has been
    arguably the most influential and ubiquitous programming language, enabling millions
    of critical web applications and services. Powered by the vibrant community of
    developers and innovative companies, the development of JavaScript frameworks
    has since emerged as a dynamic and exciting space, with opportunities for innovation
    and exploration. Each new framework brings its own philosophy and approach, representing
    a unique set of solutions to common web application and web services challenges.

- en: It is important to note that this book is not solely for those planning to develop
    their JavaScript frameworks from scratch. While it provides valuable wisdom in
    creating a well-maintained system, its primary goal extends beyond that. It is
    also designed to refine your understanding of frameworks operating under the hood,
    refining your JavaScript or software developer skills. It encourages you to think
    from a framework’s perspective, thus fostering a more profound comprehension of
    reusable software architectures. Whether you’re an experienced developer looking
    to delve deeper into your toolkit or a newcomer seeking to understand the framework
    landscape, this book will be advantageous to your career.
