<p class="nonindent">“<em class="calibre4">The only way to discover the limits of the possible is to go beyond them into the impossible</em>.” – Arthur C. Clarke</p>
<p class="nonindent">Throughout the book, we learned many important concepts and methods of utilizing Node.Js and Express.Js for the API needed for a project management software. With the help of this single example, we designed the necessary APIs for users, projects, tasks, and more. If you followed the chapters and did your own version of APIs, you should have a functioning backend of a PMS.</p>
<p class="nonindent">There is a lot more which can be done, but it cannot be covered in a single book alone. This chapter will try to cover what can be done further, along with best practices which can be followed. In executing all that, you should have pretty decent software at hand.</p>
<p class="nonindent">The journey has just begun.</p>
<h1 class="sec" id="s269"><a href="toc.xhtml#s269a" class="calibre6">Structure</a></h1>
<p class="nonindent">In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li class="calibre9">The Story so Far</li>
<li class="calibre9">Next Steps</li>
<li class="calibre9">Staying Ahead</li>
<li class="calibre9">Further Readings</li>
<li class="calibre9">Wrapping Up</li>
</ul>
<h1 class="sec" id="s270"><a href="toc.xhtml#s270a" class="calibre6">The Story So far</a></h1>
<p class="nonindent">Recalling the Node.js demonstration at JSConf 2009 by Ryan Dahl, we began learning about Node.js. Starting from the basics of Node.js and its beautiful way of working with Event Loop, we learned where it can be used and also discussed some pros and cons.</p>
<p class="nonindent">We learned the installation of Node.js on multiple platforms and created the basic HTTP and HTTPS servers with and without the module cluster. Cluster module helps to harness the capability of the machine and significantly improves performance.</p>
<p class="nonindent"><a id="page355"/>People had been writing the code of Node.js applications in JavaScript the usual way, but then Microsoft released TypeScript in 2012. Being open source, cross-platform, and supporting object oriented programming with its strong type checking made developers’ life easier by detecting bugs and mistakes . Therefore, developers started adapting to TypeScript.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Keeping this in mind, <em class="calibre4"><a href="c02.xhtml">Chapter 2, “Introduction to TypeScript”</a></em> focused on covering the basics of TypeScript. After the necessary packages installation, a basic application and some tiny examples helped us understand the key concepts of the language.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Next, we learned about Express.js and how it could be used to create API endpoints easily. We installed necessary packages of Express.js, and gained familiarity with the core concepts, along with the pros and cons.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Understanding Node.js applications in Express.js through discrete examples is feasible, but developing a cohesive application provides deeper insight into application planning, design, and execution. Hence we started writing one application to understand it all. In <em class="calibre4"><a href="c04.xhtml">Chapter 4, Planning the App</a></em>, we started with the planning of the application — a project management system. We did a setup of the project, necessary dependencies, directory structure, and also created the needed database tables along with routes skeleton.</p>
<p class="nonindent">We laid the foundation so that we can begin building the API, a project management software would require.</p>
<p class="nonindent">For any enterprise application, whether it is only backend API or full stack, access management is a must have feature. That is what we did too — by creating APIs for user management, and further enhanced the chapter with a ‘<em class="calibre4">forgot password</em>’ feature. We created a token based authentication system for which we used the <code class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre3">jsonwebtoken</strong></code> package.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Once we had the users in the system, we began writing the project and task module in <em class="calibre4"><a href="c06.xhtml">Chapter 6, “REST API for Project and Task Modules”</a></em>. We covered the basic crud operations for projects and tasks entities, along with assigning to users.</p>
<p class="nonindent"><em class="calibre4"><a href="c07.xhtml">Chapter 7, “API Caching”</a></em> focused on caching that is crucial for performance enhancement in high-traffic applications. We implemented Redis for data caching and developed a Cache Util to manage Redis interactions.</p>
<p class="nonindent">In web applications where communication is the key, integrating a notification module is essential. We not only implemented this feature in <em class="calibre4"><a href="c08.xhtml">Chapter 8, “Notification Module”</a></em> but also utilized Redis Queues to enhance its efficiency. As an example of using the notification system, we modified the code to automatically send notifications to relevant project members whenever a new task was created.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Needless to say how important unit testing is, we learned the basics of unit testing in <em class="calibre4"><a href="c09.xhtml">Chapter 9, “Testing API”</a></em>. <a id="page356"/>After necessary configuration, we used the Mocha framework along with Chai to write unit tests.</p>
<p class="nonindent">For the final touch, we delved into a crucial aspect with <em class="calibre4"><a href="c10.xhtml">Chapter 10, “Building and Deploying Application”</a></em> while covering a notable concept of code obfuscation.</p>
<p class="nonindent">The journey so far has been an extensive exploration of building a robust application with Node.js and Express.js, covering everything from basics to more advanced topics like caching, unit testing and deployment strategies. This should equip you with the skills and knowledge to create, optimize and deploy efficient, scalable web applications.</p>
<h1 class="sec" id="s271"><a href="toc.xhtml#s271a" class="calibre6">Next Steps</a></h1>
<p class="nonindent">There is only a small part of “<em class="calibre4">what’s possible</em>” that could be covered in this book. Depending on the context, further development can be achieved. In this section, we will enlist some of the features which can be developed to enhance the application further.</p>
<p class="nonindent">The points being discussed can be thought of — things that can be added further, and the best practices on how it can be done. The following points not only cover what could enhance the application but also the ways to make it scalable and maintainable.</p>
<h1 class="sec" id="s272"><a href="toc.xhtml#s272a" class="calibre6">FrontEnd</a></h1>
<p class="nonindent">A project management software is usually a web-application. The days of desktop applications are over. The time now is of collaboration, communication, and most importantly of availability. A web application can be available anywhere in the world. It can be accessed through a laptop, or a mobile phone, and that serves the purpose. Development of the front end was not in the scope of the book. However, let us discuss some aspects of how to get it done.</p>
<p class="nonindent">There are many popular frameworks at the time of writing this book — React, Angular, Vue.js. All of these are capable of making it a dynamic and responsive user interface. Additionally, Bootstrap can help with a uniform and responsive styling.</p>
<p class="nonindent">A project management application could have the following pages in user interface:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre3">Dashboard</strong>: To show the project activities, summary of assigned tasks, quick actions such as creating a new task, <a id="page357"/>new project, and more. The counts of all projects, assigned projects, tasks assigned could also be shown as big numbers.</li>
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre3">Projects</strong>: All of the assigned projects can be listed as a table. Some buttons to perform some actions such as adding a new project, managing project memberships can also be shown for the project manager roles. For each project in the list, users should be able to open the list of all issues, list of outstanding issues, and more. The options can be customized to open the list of issues in testing for QA team members.</li>
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre3">Users</strong>: Admins can be facilitated with a page to manage users.</li>
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre3">A User profile Icon</strong>: An icon on the top right which opens the user profile where a user can manage his/her own profile, for example, name, timezone settings, password, notification settings, and more.</li>
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre3">Reports</strong>: For project managers it could be a useful page to analyze the project status.</li>
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre3">Server Status</strong>: A page for admin, where current CPU, memory and storage status can be shown.</li>
</ul>
<p class="nonindent">There could be more, depending on the requirements and scale of the project.</p>
<h1 class="sec" id="s273"><a href="toc.xhtml#s273a" class="calibre6">Reporting</a></h1>
<p class="nonindent">Reporting is a crucial aspect of the project management application. It might look like a huge task, but it is not so difficult to implement.</p>
<p class="nonindent">It is important to analyze what kind of reports we are seeking. A set of simple time-series showing the number of active and closed issues to show the progress of the project could be useful. In the case of Agile development, showing project progress as velocity could be important.</p>
<p class="nonindent">A pie chart of the number of issues in each phase— backlog, development, testing, and closed can also be shown. A report of the number of opened issues versus number of closed issues is also a good performance index for a project.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Reporting would need key changes at front end and back end as well. It would be wise to create a dedicated module at the back end to generate reports. Some reports could be generated through a scheduler (for example, generating reports at midnight everyday) to persist in order to avoid doing repetitive processing for every request. Some reports would be on-request and real-time. Abstraction of the reporting module will provide clean implementation.</p>
<p class="nonindent">A data visualization library will be needed to generate reports with charts. Open-source libraries like <code class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre3">D3.js</strong></code>, <code class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre3">Chart.js</strong></code>, <code class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre3">Plotly</strong></code>, <code class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre3">Vis</strong></code>, and others can be a good option. If cost is not an issue, <code class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre3">Highcharts</strong></code> and <code class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre3">amCharts</strong></code> are among the top tools that can be tried.</p>
<h1 class="sec" id="s274"><a href="toc.xhtml#s274a" class="calibre6">Applying Machine Learning</a></h1>
<p class="nonindent">There are many opportunities to apply machine learning in a web-application. If you track the user traffic, a surge detection in traffic could help to maintain high-availability by taking appropriate action at the right time.</p>
<p class="nonindent"><a id="page358"/>By tracking user activities and applying machine learning to it, a tailored user-interface could be provided to users for a more engaging application.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Tracking user activities can also help to analyze which actions are taken or which pages are visited more than others. Back end operations such as caching, database queries, and others could be optimized for top actions.</p>
<p class="nonindent">A prediction could be done for project completion date, or sprint performance in case of Agile development. There are numerous such applications which can be done.</p>
<h1 class="sec" id="s275"><a href="toc.xhtml#s275a" class="calibre6">Server Monitoring</a></h1>
<p class="nonindent">As the traffic grows, the resource usage grows and it is vital to keep track of the CPU, RAM, and storage of the servers along with database and network. There are ways in which the server can be monitored.</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre3">Using built-in operating system tools</strong>: Most operating systems, specially servers where applications are usually deployed, offer tools for monitoring resources such as <code class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre3">top</strong></code>, <code class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre3">htop</strong></code>, <code class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre3">vmstat</strong></code>, and so on, for Linux.</li>
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre3">A separate module inside the application</strong>: The application could be modified to create a module which periodically tracks and stores the resource usage in the database. This data can be shown, visualized in the front end. A separate page could be created. Additionally, alerts can be implemented whenever a resource usage crosses the set threshold. For example, if available RAM is 16 GB, then a threshold can be set to 12 GB. Whenever RAM usage crosses 12 GB, a notification alert can be sent to Admin to take necessary actions.</li>
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre3">Custom scripts</strong>: Python, Bash, or other languages can also be used to write scripts which can monitor the resource usage of machine and server externally and it can be integrated with an alerting system.</li>
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre3">Other tools</strong>: Prometheus, complemented with Grafana can be used to see real time statistics of the servers.</li>
</ul>
<p class="nonindent">Depending on the deployment other tools can be of help. For cloud deployment, there are cloud provider specific tools, for example, AWS Cloudwatch, Azure Monitor, and Google Cloud operations suite.</p>
<h1 class="sec" id="s276"><a href="toc.xhtml#s276a" class="calibre6">Security Features</a></h1>
<p class="nonindent">As of now, the application uses a token system to provide authentication and authorization for users. We created <code class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre3">access_token</strong></code> and <code class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre3">refresh_token</strong></code> using <code class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre3">jsonwebtoken</strong></code>. Front end could use the <code class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre3">access_token</strong></code> for every request and if <code class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre3">access_token</strong></code> expires, and <code class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre3">refresh_token</strong></code> is available, it could be used to generate a new <code class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre3">access_token</strong></code>.</p>
<p class="nonindent"><a id="page359"/>This could be improved with other grant types and features necessary for <code class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre3">OAuth2</strong></code> implementation.</p>
<h1 class="sec1" id="s277"><a href="toc.xhtml#s277a" class="calibre6">SSL/TLS Encryption</a></h1>
<p class="nonindent">Necessary support for SSL should be there. This means, if we need to host the application with a url such as HTTPS://, it should be possible, although there can be strategies to implement this. One is to make the application configurable to choose between HTTPS and HTTP. Another one is to use <code class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre3">nginx</strong></code> in front and use SSL certificates with help of a Certification Authority (CA). Let us Encrypt is a free service and is widely recognized. It is easy to set up and provides a necessary level of encryption for secure communication.</p>
<h1 class="sec1" id="s278"><a href="toc.xhtml#s278a" class="calibre6">Social Media Login</a></h1>
<p class="nonindent">In case the application is going to be in public domain, it could be nice to implement login via social media platforms such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, and so on, to provide a seamless user registration and login.</p>
<h1 class="sec1" id="s279"><a href="toc.xhtml#s279a" class="calibre6">Two-Factor Authentication</a></h1>
<p class="nonindent">Every now and then, we see the passwords and other details being hacked from websites with less secure infrastructure. It becomes indispensable to implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) to add an additional layer of security.</p>
<h1 class="sec1" id="s280"><a href="toc.xhtml#s280a" class="calibre6">LDAP Integration</a></h1>
<p class="nonindent">If the application is deployed as a private to an organization, and if the organization has their own LDAP server in place, it could be great to make an application integrated with LDAP for user management. It can streamline the authentication and authorization process within the application.</p>
<h1 class="sec" id="s281"><a href="toc.xhtml#s281a" class="calibre6">Container-Based Deployments</a></h1>
<p class="nonindent">Sometimes, it is necessary to deploy the application as containers. Containerization with Docker and its orchestration with help of Kubernetes is the way to go. Together they provide a smooth and scalable deployment.</p>
<p class="nonindent">To enable containerized deployment, you need to create:</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre3">Dockerfile</strong>: a Dockerfile is needed by Docker for specifying the base image (linux flavor and version needed for running the application), dependencies, variables, commands, and so on.</li>
<li class="calibre9"><a id="page360"/><code class="calibre7"><strong class="calibre3">docker-compose.yml</strong></code>: This is a YAML file that defines how the docker container should behave in production. This is used with Docker Compose, which is a tool for running the multi-container docker applications. With this file, we can also configure the application’s service.</li>
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre3">Kubernetes configs</strong>: We need to write Manifests for deployment, ConfigMaps, and other files to configure Kubernetes to orchestrate the Docker Containers.</li>
</ul>
<p class="nonindent">Usually when there is a need for this expertise, there are dedicated teams to do this job within the organization. In case you are willing to give it a try, installation of docker, writing a simple Dockerfile, and learning basic commands to run the container is the starting point.</p>
<h1 class="sec" id="s282"><a href="toc.xhtml#s282a" class="calibre6">Swagger UI</a></h1>
<p class="nonindent">Since the application currently in place offers APIs, it is important to provide API testing and documentation. Swagger UI provides a web-based user interface where users can see the API endpoints, access the documentation associated with each endpoint, and make a call to it directly from the browser.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Swagger UI is a tool provided by <a href="https://swagger.io">https://swagger.io</a>. It is popular due to its ease of use, one place to test endpoints and access documentation, security in place and being real-time and accurate.</p>
<p class="nonindent">It is not something to be shown to website users, for example, project managers and members since they do not need to know the underlying endpoints. However, for developers and QA team members it is an essential tool.</p>
<h1 class="sec" id="s283"><a href="toc.xhtml#s283a" class="calibre6">Staying Ahead</a></h1>
<p class="nonindent">At the time of writing, there are many Large Language Models (LLMs) available, for example, OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. This is not traditional machine learning. This is an era of Generative Artificial Intelligence. AI is not just a tool to predict a value, for example, a house price, or to classify something into categories anymore. AI can also generate content for us. Given a context, AI can provide a paragraph, a page, a book in no time. AI can find errors in a code. Impressively, it can write code too. GitHub’s co-pilot is capable of providing in-place code snippets relevant to your application. AI can teach you a topic if you are willing to.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Keeping in mind all of this, it is important to think and pen down how Generative AI can help. Considering our prime example, Project Management System, we could give a basic idea of what we are trying to manage and AI could help with creating the tasks for us. If we provide the complete Software Requirement Specification (SRS) to the AI, it can generate all of the details of tasks as well.</p>
<p class="nonindent"><a id="page361"/>Generative AI can be used in the following key areas (keeping it focused to the PMS):</p>
<ul class="bull">
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre3">Project planning</strong> : If provided input goals such as what are we trying to achieve with the project, number of resources, timelines and constraints, GenAI can help with a comprehensive project plan, sprints, or milestone planning.</li>
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre3">Risk Assessment</strong> : If the project status does not meet the milestone timelines, a risk assessment can be provided.</li>
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre3">Resource Allocation</strong>: If the resources are to be picked from a pool, given the history of resources work in other projects, a decision could be made for picking up the right resource for the project.</li>
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre3">Preparing Reports</strong>: Based on the current status of the project, automated reports can be generated.</li>
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre3">Task Prioritization</strong>: Tasks can be given priority at the beginning of the project and the priority can be changed, if needed, based on the project status.</li>
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre3">Predictive Analysis</strong>: Based on the tasks complexity, status and in which phase it is, milestones status, a project end date of the next milestone date can be predicted.</li>
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre3">Preparing Lessons Learned</strong>: At the end of the project, a list of lessons learned can be prepared to avoid making mistakes next time.</li>
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre3">Real-time Sentiment Analysis</strong>: A task is usually commented on by the developers. A real-time sentiment analysis could be done.</li>
</ul>
<p class="nonindent">There could be a lot more ways GenAI can help.</p>
<h1 class="sec" id="s284"><a href="toc.xhtml#s284a" class="calibre6">Further Reading</a></h1>
<p class="nonindent">This book covered Node.js, TypeScript, Express.js, Mocha, Chai, Redis, and some other tools. A book covering many aspects could only touch basic to medium levels of knowledge. For further learning, there are some suggestions for you to try.</p>
<h1 class="sec" id="s285"><a href="toc.xhtml#s285a" class="calibre6">Advanced Node.js Development</a></h1>
<p class="nonindent">Topics such as streams, child processes, performance optimizations, and other such advanced topics can be learned further. Moreover, using decorators and design patterns will make your code neat, near zero defect, and maintainable.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Node.js can also be a great choice for applications needing heavy, real-time communication. Technologies such as Socket.io and websockets offer the necessary features.</p>
<p class="nonindent">One popular architecture is microservices. Resources focusing on microservices architectures can be considered for further learning.</p>
<h1 class="sec" id="s286"><a id="page362" class="calibre6"/><a href="toc.xhtml#s286a" class="calibre6">Full Stack Development</a></h1>
<p class="nonindent">A browser understands only three things— HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Since the underlying language, JavaScript, is the same for back end, for example, Node.js and front end, for example, React, Angular, Vue, and many more frameworks, getting into the shoes of a full-stack developer becomes rather easier.</p>
<p class="nonindent">After gaining a good understanding of Node.js/Typescript, getting familiar with React or Angular is a common trend as seen recently.</p>
<h1 class="sec" id="s287"><a href="toc.xhtml#s287a" class="calibre6">Test-Driven Development</a></h1>
<p class="nonindent">There are many books that offer guidance on implementing projects using Test-Driven development. The TDD approach, if followed religiously, results in bug free projects. Not only does it allow you to catch the bugs at early stages, but it also lowers the cost of development and maintenance.</p>
<p class="nonindent">In this approach, the test cases are written first and then the code is written in a way that the test would pass. Hence it is vital to write test cases which cover testing for all possible inputs.</p>
<p class="nonindent">There is usually a negative mindset when you talk about TDD. It is mostly about the time and learning needed to write the test cases upfront. However, when studies were performed, overall time and cost of the projects were much less as compared to projects executed without TDD.</p>
<h1 class="sec" id="s288"><a href="toc.xhtml#s288a" class="calibre6">Performance Tuning</a></h1>
<p class="nonindent">There would be a point in life when you would have realized that the queries being used in the applications are taking more time than expected. You try to optimize the database using indexes, growing RAM size, and more. However, there is more to database management and optimization than just these tunings.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Application logic is another place where the optimization is done. Finding memory leaks and CPU-hungry logics is critical. The scary part is that developers often forget or do not take care of the optimization at the time of development. Sometimes, stress tests are also following the same path so they do not cover all parts of the code and thus some issues remain unidentified. These issues arise at the production instance, and at that time, it becomes challenging to fix.</p>
<h1 class="sec" id="s289"><a href="toc.xhtml#s289a" class="calibre6">Other Topics</a></h1>
<p class="nonindent">Apart from the aforementioned topics, the resources on serverless architecture, DevOps practices, and functional programming in Node.js can also be tried.</p>
<p class="nonindent"><a id="page363"/>Integration of AI/ML, data analysis and visualization libraries is a key to get into a Data Science background.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Another important aspect is the security of your application. Although we have covered topics such as OAuth and JWT, more can be learned on how to secure Node.js applications.</p>
<h1 class="sec" id="s290"><a href="toc.xhtml#s290a" class="calibre6">Final Thoughts</a></h1>
<p class="nonindent">As we reach the end of the book, it is important to reflect on the vast landscape that we have traversed. From the basics to building the API powered with authentication, caching and unit tests, we have covered significant ground.</p>
<p class="nonindent">As you progress further, you shall witness the power of JavaScript and will realize why it is becoming the most popular language of all time. The introduction to TypeScript made it more powerful by offering type safety and enhancing the code quality.</p>
<p class="nonindent">Remember that the landscape of web development is ever-changing. Technologies evolve. A decade ago everything was Java, Dot net, and Python. Today JavaScript is the one rocking and being bread and butter for a significant percentage of developers. The developers survey by Stackoverlfow.com in 2022 revealed that 67% developers use JavaScript for their work.</p>
<p class="nonindent">As you continue your journey, keep experimenting, keep innovating, keep learning. Most importantly, keep your passion for coding, for learning, for trying new things, alive. After all, the <em class="calibre4">journey has just begun</em>.</p>
