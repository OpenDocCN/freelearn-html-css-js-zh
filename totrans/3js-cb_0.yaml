- en: Each year, web browsers become more powerful, increase in features, and improve
    in performance. Throughout the last couple of years, browsers have emerged as
    a great platform to create immersive, complex, and beautiful applications. Most
    of the current applications that are being built use modern HTML5 features such
    as web sockets, local storage, and advanced CSS techniques for styling.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most modern browsers, however, also have support for a technology that can be
    used to create beautiful, 3D graphics and animations that use the GPU to achieve
    maximal performance. This technology is called WebGL and is supported by the latest
    versions of Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Internet Explorer. With WebGL, you can
    create 3D scenes that run directly in your browser, without the need for any plugins.
    Support on the desktop for this standard is great, and most modern devices and
    mobile browsers fully support this standard.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To create WebGL applications, however, you need to learn a new language (called
    GLSL) and understand how vertex and fragment shaders can be used to render your
    3D geometries. Luckily, though, there are a number of JavaScript libraries available
    that wrap the WebGL internals and provide a JavaScript API that you can use without
    having to understand the most complex features of WebGL. One of the most mature
    and feature-rich of those libraries is Three.js.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Three.js started in 2010 and provides a large number of easy-to-use APIs that
    expose all the features of Three.js and allows you to quickly create complex 3D
    scenes and animations in your browser.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Through its APIs, you can do pretty much everything that you want with Three.js.
    However, because it has so many features, it's sometimes difficult to find the
    right way to accomplish something. Throughout the years, Three.js has been under
    heavy development, but it is stabilizing now. So many examples and tutorials that
    you find online are outdated and don't work anymore. In this book, we'll provide
    you with a large number of recipes that you can follow to accomplish some common
    tasks with Three.js. Each example is accompanied with a runnable example that
    you can examine to better understand the recipe or adapt for your own purposes.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Getting Started"), *Getting Started*, covers
    the basic recipes that you can use when you create new Three.js-based applications.
    We''ll show you how you can set up a basic Three.js skeleton using any of the
    available Three.js renderers. We''ll further show you WebGL detection, loading
    resources, setting up an animation loop, adding drag and drop support, and controlling
    your scene through the keyboard.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Geometries and Meshes"), *Geometries and
    Meshes*, shows you a number of recipes that focus on creating, working with and
    manipulating geometries and meshes. We''ll go into detail on how to rotate meshes
    in different ways, manipulate them using matrix transformations, generate geometries
    programmatically, and load models from Blender and in other formats.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Working with the Camera"), *Working with
    the Camera*, focuses on recipes that manipulate the cameras available in Three.js.
    It shows you how to work with the perspective and the orthogonal camera. This
    chapter also shows you recipes that explain how to rotate a camera, center a camera,
    and follow objects around.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Materials and Textures"), *Materials and
    Textures*, contains recipes that explain how to get good results working with
    the materials provided by Three.js. It has recipes on transparency, reflections,
    UV mapping, face materials, bump and normal maps and also explains how the various
    blend modes work.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Lights and Custom Shaders"), *Lights and
    Custom Shaders*, has recipes that deal with the workings of the different light
    sources in Three.js and shows you how to work with WebGL shaders. It shows you
    how to correctly set up shadows, create a sun-like lighting source, and goes into
    the differences between spot lights, point lights, and directional lights. In
    this chapter, we''ll also provide you with a couple of recipes that explain how
    to create a custom vertex shader and a custom fragment shader.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Point Clouds and Postprocessing"), *Point
    Clouds and Postprocessing*, provides you with recipes that show you how to set
    up postprocessing. With postprocessing, you can enhance your scene with blurring,
    coloring, or other types of effects. This chapter also contains recipes that explain
    features of a particle system, such as animation and particle materials.'

    shows you a number of recipes that help you in animating the objects in your scene
    and show you how to add physics (such as gravity and collision detection) to your
    scene.'

- en: The only thing that you need for this book is a simple text editor to experiment
    with the provided recipes and a modern web browser to run the examples. For some
    of the advanced recipes, it is preferred to have a locally installed web server
    or disable some security settings in your browser. In [Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Getting
    Started"), *Getting Started*, recipes are provided that explain how to set up
    such a server and disable the relevant security settings.
