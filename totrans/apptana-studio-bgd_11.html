<div class="section" title="Sharing or restoring your configurations"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl1sec142"/>Sharing or restoring your configurations</h1></div></div></div><p>As you already know, configuring the Aptana <a id="id657" class="indexterm"/>Studio can be a very long process. You may have already adjusted a lot of settings and there are nevertheless a lot of settings that you can still adjust. Thankfully you don't have to select all these settings twice, as the Aptana Studio comes with a lot of import and export features. If you have to reinstall a new instance of Aptana Studio or set up a new instance, you can easily import all your settings without you have to reconfigure them all again.</p><p>This feature is much more useful, for development teams, especially in the beginning of the project when the project leader elaborates a basic configuration. This task should be done with a handful of senior or lead developers, but not too many (if the group is too large the process may unnecessarily take a long time). The important points for elaborating the basic configuration are as follows:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Base configuration: We start with the base <a id="id658" class="indexterm"/>configuration. We have already covered this basic configuration in <a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Working with Workspaces and Projects">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Working with Workspaces and Projects</em></span>. There we had examined the behavior, in which, <a id="id659" class="indexterm"/>when we had created a new workspace, all of our settings were lost. We do however, also need this functionality when we are setting up a completely new instance of Aptana Studio. As you may remember, we found this import/export feature by going to <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> and navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>General</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> within the tree. More information about performing an import or export can be found in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Importing and exporting preferences</em></span> section of <a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Working with Workspaces and Projects">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Working with Workspaces and Projects</em></span>. Among the many general settings, there are also settings such as the Bookmarks view configuration, Key Preferences, Tasks view configuration, and so on.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Connection settings: The export of the <a id="id660" class="indexterm"/>connection settings, as we already learned in <a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Remotely Working with FTP">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Remotely Working with FTP</em></span>, contains all configured connections from the Connection Manager. If the development team works frequently with the connections to different servers, it's very useful to create an export file which contains all of the required connections. After importing the connections, the user might have to just change the username for each connection, and enter their password (Note that no passwords are exported by the Connection settings export). As you may remember, this import/export feature can be found by going to <span class="strong"><strong>File</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Import</strong></span> and by navigating to <span class="strong"><strong>Aptana Studio</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Connection Settings</strong></span> <a id="id661" class="indexterm"/>within the tree. More information about performing an import or export can be found in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Importing and exporting FTP settings</em></span> section of <a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Remotely Working with FTP">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Remotely Working with FTP</em></span>.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Syntax highlight: The team should <a id="id662" class="indexterm"/> work together to create a syntax highlight configuration for the most frequently used programming languages. This gives you the advantage when a team member needs help from another team member. The ones helping are able to orient themselves faster within the source code of the other. They quickly recognize all important keywords and code structures. We have already covered the topic of creating and configuring a syntax highlight theme in this chapter. We have also seen how to change a theme in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Time for action – changing the color theme</em></span> section in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Customizing Aptana Studio 3</em></span> section of <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Basics and How to Use Perspectives and Views">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Basics and How to Use Perspectives and Views</em></span>. We will look at how you can import and export themes in the next few pages of this chapter but in the meantime we will complete this listing.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Code formatting: For the same reason stated earlier, the team should format all their project source code in the same way. Therefore, they should work together to configure a code formatter <a id="id663" class="indexterm"/>profile that every developer must use. One bonus for doing this is that every developer can read the code faster when he has to read it on another team member's workstation, and it will also save a lot time and stress when they don't have to format each file before they can work with it. In <a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. PHP Projects">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>PHP Projects</em></span>, in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Using and configuring the code formatter</em></span> section, we have already seen how we can create some profiles. How we can import and export these profiles will be seen later in this chapter.</li></ul></div><p>These were the important points for importing and exporting a lot of settings from Aptana Studio. Importing and exporting the base configuration and the connection settings has already been seen in the previous chapters. However, importing and exporting syntax highlight themes and code formatting profiles is something we will take a look at in the next section.</p><p>If you have already created your own syntax highlight theme, you will now surely want to know how to export it and restore it at a later point in time. So, let's take a look at this.</p></div>

</h2></div></div></div><p>We just navigated into the preferences and exported an existing syntax highlight theme to our local file system. Then we went back to the preferences and imported the theme back into Aptana Studio. With this process you can restore your syntax highlight theme to other Aptana Studio instances, or share it with other developer's code formatter profiles.</p><p>In <a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. PHP Projects">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>PHP Projects</em></span>, we have seen how we can create our own code formatting profile. However, like the syntax highlight themes, it's best practice to export these code formatting profiles in order to create a backup of these settings or to share it with other developers. It's just as easy as importing and exporting syntax highlight themes. Let's try it!</p></div></div>

</h2></div></div></div><p>We have just navigated through the preferences and exported an existing code formatter profile to our local filesystem. After that, we went back to the preferences and imported the profile back into Aptana Studio. Using this process, you can restore your code formatter profile to other Aptana Studio instances, or share it with other developers.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Sharing Aptana Studio preferences"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl1sec145"/>Sharing Aptana Studio preferences</h1></div></div></div><p>In the previous section, we have seen how you can export a lot of the settings and preferences of Aptana Studio. If your team now starts the developing process and has to configure the Aptana Studio workspace of each of their workstations, they can save a lot of time by simply importing the settings. When new developers join your team<a id="id674" class="indexterm"/>, they can be up and running with a fully configured Aptana Studio version in a few minutes without having to do endless amounts of <a id="id675" class="indexterm"/>configuration.</p><p>Here's the process again in a few steps:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Create your first Aptana Studio instance and configure it completely to the needs of your upcoming project.</li><li class="listitem">Export all settings and share them with other team members.</li><li class="listitem">Each team member now installs the current version of Aptana Studio on their workstation and imports the shared settings.</li></ol></div><p>The sharing of the team's settings, templates, and much more could be handled over an integrated source control, such as SVN. The team leader simply creates a new repository and defines the team members who can work on files and then commit it. This small circle can now extend the team's settings and template base to other team members , who can just check out each new project convention from the SVN and use it immediately. A further advantage of using version control is the history of the development of the configuration and template usage.</p><p>An additional solution of sharing a fully configured instance of the Aptana Studio is to make a complete copy of this basic installation of the Aptana Studio. One disadvantage of this process is that you have to create a basic installation for each operating system. Although, another advantage is that the team members will already have the <a id="id676" class="indexterm"/>required plugins installed. After installing a copy of the basic installation, the developer just has to perform an update of the IDE.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip60"/>Tip</h3><p>

Luckily Aptana Studio provides you with the ability to do this. You can place a bookmark simply on a line of any source code file without changing its content. <a id="id678" class="indexterm"/>Aptana Studio then remembers all bookmarks within your project.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip61"/>Tip</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Using bookmarks in libraries</strong></span>
</p><p>If you're using external libraries and you have to often look up functionalities within other files, it is worth using bookmarks in order to jump quickly and easily to the required places. The only requirement for this is that the external libraries must be within an Aptana Studio project.</p></div></div></div>

To enable us to do this Aptana Studio provides us a bookmark view. Let's take a look and see how to work with this view.</p></div><div class="section" title="The bookmark view"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec160"/>The bookmark view</h2></div></div></div><p>The bookmark view is a list that contains all of the available <a id="id681" class="indexterm"/>bookmarks in your currently opened project.

It then places the cursor on the line where the bookmark is located.</p><p>Unfortunately, over time, your list of bookmarks can become quite untidy and you may need to clean up or filter the bookmark view. We will now see how this can be done. For the next <span class="emphasis"><em>Time for action</em></span> section, <a id="id682" class="indexterm"/>we will give ourselves the task of filtering all of the available ZendFramework bookmarks.</p></div></div>

As discussed previously, it's always recommended that you provide your commits with detailed comments about what you have done. Hence, when you often make similar changes, it's a good idea to create a template for these comments.</p><p>Many development teams also use the post-commit hook of the SVN Repository in order to further process the committed data in additional ways. Therefore, it could be advantageous that every team member writes his comments <a id="id688" class="indexterm"/>in the same style and structure so that automatic processing is possible. </p><p>In order to make this easier, you can create templates for your SVN comments.</p></div>

<div class="section" title="Working with tasks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl1sec151"/>Working with tasks</h1></div></div></div><p>While developing a web application, it may often be the case that you are working with sections that are not currently of high importance or are not completely coded, and you want to finish this part at a later time. Unfortunately, as your project gets larger and larger, that you may forget these sections within your source code, leaving holes in your code. What is the best solution to allow your to remember these positions?</p><p>How great would it be if there was a self-organizing to-do list that contains points such as to-dos and fix-mes, and the entries may also have different <a id="id692" class="indexterm"/>priorities. For this reason, the Aptana Studio provides you a Task view. This view helps you to remember all of the positions where you have to do or fix something. All entries within the list are automatically added while coding on your project. Aptana Studio understands by default the <a id="id693" class="indexterm"/>
<code class="literal">@TODO</code> and the <a id="id694" class="indexterm"/>
<code class="literal">@FIXME</code> tags, used for tagging task entries.</p><p>The tags that Aptana Studio generally understands can be configured within the preferences. Let's take a look at how this works.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Time for action &#x2013; configuring the tasks and managing the task tags"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl1sec152"/>Time for action – configuring the tasks and managing the task tags</h1></div></div></div><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">First navigate to <span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Preferences</strong></span> and go to <span class="strong"><strong>Aptana Studio</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Tasks</strong></span>. The <span class="strong"><strong>Tasks</strong></span> window is shown in the following <a id="id695" class="indexterm"/>screenshot:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8246_11_18.jpg" alt="Time for action – configuring the tasks and managing the task tags"/></div></li><li class="listitem">In this preference window, we firstly need to make a decision whether we want to use case-sensitive or case-insensitive task tags, via the <a id="id696" class="indexterm"/><span class="strong"><strong>Case sensitive task tags</strong></span> checkbox, located near the bottom of the window. Based on this decision, we either select the case-sensitive task tags or we don't. It is often a good choice to use case-sensitive task tags because if you write a comment where the tag name is contained in the comment text, <a id="id697" class="indexterm"/>the comment will be marked as a task.</li><li class="listitem">The list above the checkbox allows us to get an overview of the currently available task tags. On the left, we see the tag name itself; and on the right, the related priority of each tag. In order to edit an entry, select the entry you want to change and click the <a id="id698" class="indexterm"/><span class="strong"><strong>Edit...</strong></span> button.</li><li class="listitem">Within the edit window, you can change the tag name or priority of the task. After you have adjusted the task tag to fit with your requirements, click on <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span> to save your changes, as shown in the following screenshot:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8246_11_19.jpg" alt="Time for action – configuring the tasks and managing the task tags"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Now we can add a new task tag by clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>New...</strong></span> button in order to open the creation window. This window has the same structure as the edit window. You only need to enter the tag name and the required priority of your new task tag, and that's it. At this point you can create a task tag named <code class="literal">OPTIMIZE</code> for source code parts that function <a id="id699" class="indexterm"/>well, but they might need to be optimized at a later date. An example of this task creation is shown in the following screenshot:<div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/8246_11_20.jpg" alt="Time for action – configuring the tasks and managing the task tags"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Now click on <span class="strong"><strong>Apply</strong></span> and then on the <span class="strong"><strong>OK</strong></span> button to complete the configuration of the tasks.</li></ol></div><div class="section" title="What just happened?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec163"/>

</h2></div></div></div><p>We have just configured the task behavior and managed the task tags that the Aptana Studio uses for feeding its task list. We have seen how we can add new task tags, and how to edit or remove the available task tags.</p><p>If you work within a development team, you may need to add some some more tags but thanks to the management of the tags this is not a problem, and you can create as many tags as you need.</p><p>Now we will see how we can work with the task tags.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Creating tasks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl1sec153"/>Creating tasks</h1></div></div></div><p>Creating tasks can be done in two different ways.

<span class="strong"><strong>Where are my tasks?</strong></span>
</p><p>What if you have created your task as described here, <a id="id705" class="indexterm"/>but they don't appear within the task list? Make sure that your project has a nature type, otherwise the build process won't read out the task comments.</p></div></div><p>But, you surely may wonder, which method should I prefer? Well, it turns out that the comment-based method of creating tasks has more advantages. Firstly, the Tasks can be shared with Git and SVN; and secondly, if the comments are PHPDoc conform, you will also be to fill in these tasks into your PHPDoc documentation. The latter method of creating tasks is perhaps better for a single developer who doesn't want to equip his/her code with all the things that he/she still has to create.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip64"/>Tip</h3><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Tasks within developer teams</strong></span>
</p><p>When working on large projects, it's very advantageous when all team members have marked their tasks, bugs, and optimizations with the related tags. When all occurrences are marked accordingly, the project leader is can easily gain a rough overview of how many points are left to solve without getting in contact with each developer.</p></div></div></div><div class="section" title="Have a go hero – try out what you have learned"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec166"/>Have a go hero – try out what you have learned</h2></div></div></div><p>Your task now is to create your own syntax highlight theme with the highlight that you prefer.</p><p>After that, export all of your Aptana Studio settings, themes, code formatter, and so on, so that you can restore them later. After you have finished exporting your data, try to import the files back in.</p><p>Finally, when you've tried out the import and export features, make yourself familiar with the bookmarks and tasks. To do this, open one of your projects and navigate through the contained files and then place a bookmark on the lines which you use often.

<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl1sec156"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>By the end of this chapter, you should be able to create and manage your own syntax highlight themes. Additionally, you should be able to import and export the most important settings and configurations of the Aptana Studio. You should also be able to manage and optimize your work by using bookmarks and tasks.</p><p>Aptana Studio can however do much more than what we have covered here. For example, you could extend the available bundles, templates, and snippets or create new ones, as you need within your project. Further more, there is the possibility of sharing them within your development team, like the Aptana Studio team does.</p><p>When your project environment has reached such a point, the bundle keeps learning with your increasing project. Integrate all the frequently used code structures into snippets, then create file templates with the base structure of your project where all headers and footers are already contained, extend the menu functionality of the bundle so that all developers are able to use the bundle features over the menu (writing their own commands that they will be executing directly from the editor), and much more.</p><p>In the next and last chapter, we will take a look at what we have to do when errors occur.</p></div></body></html>
