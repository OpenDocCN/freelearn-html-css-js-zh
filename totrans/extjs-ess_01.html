Designing and developing apps presents numerous challenges to software engineers, which can hinder our ability to release these apps quickly and remain agile in our development process.</p><p>Assistance from frameworks and libraries is better now than ever before, and with Sencha's latest release, Ext JS 5, we can produce even richer, real-time, and engaging experiences for our users.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Ext JS Essentials</em></span> aims to touch upon all the major topics on Ext JS. By the end of this book, you'll understand:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How to use Ext JS to build rich and responsive applications</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Web <a id="id0" class="indexterm"/>application architecture with<a id="id1" class="indexterm"/> the <span class="strong"><strong>Model-View-Controller</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>MVC</strong></span>) and <span class="strong"><strong>Model-View-ViewModel</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>MVVM</strong></span>) patterns</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The framework's fundamentals, including classes, events, and user interactions</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Ext JS' core layouts, widgets, and components</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The main concepts of the data package and two-way data binding</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Methods to visualize datasets with charts</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The tools you can use to enhance your development experience</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Where to start when customizing your interface with SASS</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What you can do to test your application</li></ul></div><p>This chapter will provide a high-level overview of the framework, and explain why you should invest time and energy into learning its techniques, technology, and tools.</p><p>It's expected that you already have a programming background, but you'll discover the knowledge you require to get the most from the framework. The examples worked upon throughout the book will center on a single application, and by the end of the chapter, your development environment will be ready, and the application will run!</p><div class="section" title="What is Ext JS"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec08"/>What is Ext JS</h1></div></div></div><p>Sencha Ext JS is an application development platform that allows you to build rich user experiences<a id="id2" class="indexterm"/> using web technologies and standards. Ext JS is ideally suited to building single-page applications and provides all the tools required to enable this. However, if you only want to use a small subset of the framework, it is possible to incorporate just the widgets and classes you require. You can embed these directly on a web page, just like you would a jQuery component.</p><p>Unlike other application development frameworks, Ext JS comes with a few tricks up its sleeve. Firstly, it has been specifically designed to work cross-platform and cross-browser. Much of the headache that comes with cross-browser development has been removed for us. With little effort, your apps will run on:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Internet Explorer 8 and above</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Firefox</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Chrome</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Safari 6 and above</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Opera 12 and above</li></ul></div><p>Sencha hasn't forgotten iOS and Android either. From Ext JS 5, you'll be able to run your apps smoothly on iOS 6+ and Android 4.1+.</p><p>Secondly, Ext JS encourages best practices and the use of architectural patterns in web apps. Ext JS is an object-oriented framework with a clearly defined structure and naming convention. Ext JS supports MVC and MVVM architectures, but you're not limited by Sencha; feel free to override and extend the framework to meet your needs.</p><p>Finally, the framework is supported by thorough and well-written documentation alongside an outstanding community of users, often found on the Sencha forums or StackOverflow. There is also a community of plugins available from the Sencha Market or on GitHub. The resources are out there for you to find. Go looking, and if you can't find something just ask.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="What Ext JS isn't"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec09"/>What Ext JS isn't</h1></div></div></div><p>Before<a id="id3" class="indexterm"/> you go any further, it might be worth taking a few seconds to consider what Ext JS is not. It's not for you if you're looking to design for mobile first. Sencha has made major advancements with the framework recently to give it touch support, but it's still not best suited for mobile phones. Sencha Touch, on the other hand, is a framework specifically designed for mobile applications.</p><p>Ext JS also isn't best suited for use on websites, unless you have a specific use case. For example, if you're looking for a drop-down menu or tab panel for your website, you might be better off looking at other frameworks, such as jQuery. We're not saying that Ext JS can't do these things, but the framework has a large overhead and might be too much for these simple use cases.</p><p>As the <a id="id4" class="indexterm"/>framework is complex and contains a large number of components, it can sometimes be cumbersome to customize components and/or the look and feel of your application to suit your needs. Doing it well requires time, patience, and knowledge, but the results speak for themselves.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Use cases"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec10"/>Use cases</h1></div></div></div><p>Ext JS is<a id="id5" class="indexterm"/> used across the globe by thousands of organizations to deliver web applications to their users. The architectural patterns and components, such as grids, make it particularly well-suited to business-related applications.</p><p>Commonly, developers are using Ext JS for:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Trading apps with real-time data</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Enterprise data management apps</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Intranet applications</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Visualization applications</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Consumer-facing web apps</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Native-wrapped desktop apps</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Data capturing and monitoring systems</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Dashboards and portals</li></ul></div><p>Obviously, this list is not exhaustive, but it should give you an idea of how others are using Ext JS in the real world.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="What's new in Ext JS 5"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec11"/>What's new in Ext JS 5</h1></div></div></div><p>Ext JS 5 <a id="id6" class="indexterm"/>is yet another step forward for application developers and the end user. Its new features make it one of the world's most advanced multi-device JavaScript<a id="id7" class="indexterm"/> frameworks. Here's a summary of the major enhancements in this framework.</p><div class="section" title="Touch support"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec07"/>Touch support</h2></div></div></div><p>From <a id="id8" class="indexterm"/>one codebase, you can now build truly cross-platform apps. This release of Ext JS introduces touch capability, enabling you to deliver your desktop applications on touch-enabled devices. This puts an end to the frustration felt by users on tablets, such as iPads, or touch-screen laptops.</p><p>Sencha has provided a theme called <span class="emphasis"><em>Neptune Touch</em></span> which is more appropriate for use on touch-enabled devices. This is primarily done by increasing the size of the tappable components on-screen.</p><p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>Crisp</em></span>, version of Nept<span class="emphasis"><em>une Touch</em></span> gives you further choice as a starting point for your apps.</p></div><div class="section" title="Architectural improvements"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec08"/>Architectural improvements</h2></div></div></div><p>Further <a id="id9" class="indexterm"/>efficiencies and architectural improvements help make the framework more responsive and better for building applications. The most notable improvement here is the new MVVM architectural pattern, which enables us to develop with Ext JS using less application logic. <a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Reacting to User and Application Interactions">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Reacting to User and Application Interactions</em></span>, will take a much deeper dive into MVVM and will explain how to produce apps using it.</p></div><div class="section" title="Responsive layouts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec09"/>Responsive layouts</h2></div></div></div><p>Ext JS 5 <a id="id10" class="indexterm"/>provides the ability for your apps to have an optimal viewing experience across desktops and tablets, regardless of orientation changes, using a new responsive config system.</p></div><div class="section" title="Component enhancements"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec10"/>Component enhancements</h2></div></div></div><p>Sencha <a id="id11" class="indexterm"/>has made a number of enhancements to the components in the framework. For example, grids have the ability to have widgets added directly to the grid cell. This is going to be great for data visualization and flexible user experiences. The charting package has been upgraded for financial charting as well as to be touch-optimized.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="What you need to know"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec12"/>What you need to know</h1></div></div></div><p>Getting<a id="id12" class="indexterm"/> started with Ext JS doesn't require a huge amount of upfront knowledge, as there are plenty of examples and resources to help. However, having experience of general programming and object-oriented programming will stand you in good stead. If you happen to know JavaScript (and JSON), that is even better.</p><p>We'll be covering the MVC and MVVM architectural patterns in this book, but any prior knowledge you might have from another framework will make it easier for you. The same applies for theming your application: we'll demonstrate using SASS in an Ext JS app, but won't cover the technology in detail.</p><div class="section" title="Development environment"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec11"/>Development environment</h2></div></div></div><p>The development environment for Ext JS need be no more than a basic text editor, a local web<a id="id13" class="indexterm"/> server, and a web browser to view the output. Having said that, there are tools, some freely available, that will make your experience better. We would recommend getting familiar with your browser's built-in tools and add-ons:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Developer Tools in Chrome</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Firebug in Firefox</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Developer Tools in Internet Explorer</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Dragonfly in Opera</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Developer Tools in Safari</li></ul></div><p>Finally, it's <a id="id14" class="indexterm"/>worth noting that in recent years, JavaScript support for <span class="strong"><strong>Integrated Development Environments</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>IDEs</strong></span>) has improved greatly. Ext JS works particularly well with JetBrains IntelliJ Idea (or WebStorm if you're looking for something more basic), Eclipse, and Spket among others.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Project introduction"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec13"/>Project introduction</h1></div></div></div><p>In order to<a id="id15" class="indexterm"/> make our journey through the Ext JS framework as informative and relevant as possible, we will be developing a real-world application from start to finish. We will cover each step of the application building process and we will incorporate every new concept, widget and class that we come across into this application to impart practical knowledge that can be put to use straight away.</p><p>Our application will be a business dashboard application that will present a variety of information in a number of different formats; it will allow users to create and manipulate data structures and create a customized look and feel.</p><p>By the end of the book, our application will look like the screenshot that follows and will include the following features:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">MVVM architecture</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Data displayed in a variety of different charts</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Interactive data grids</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Custom data views</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Two-way data-bound forms</li></ul></div><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/3717_01_01.jpg" alt="Project introduction"/></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Creating our application with Sencha Cmd"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec14"/>Creating our application with Sencha Cmd</h1></div></div></div><p>Sencha Cmd is<a id="id16" class="indexterm"/> a command-line tool that automates<a id="id17" class="indexterm"/> a variety of tasks relating to the creation, development, and deployment of Ext JS and Sencha Touch applications. It has a huge number of features, many of which will be discussed in detail in <a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Reacting to User and Application Interactions">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Reacting to User and Application Interactions</em></span>. In this section, we will discuss how to install Sencha Cmd, use it to generate our business dashboard application, and ready it for production deployment.</p><div class="section" title="Installing Sencha Cmd"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec12"/>Installing Sencha Cmd</h2></div></div></div><p>Sencha <a id="id18" class="indexterm"/>Cmd is a cross-platform tool and has variations available for each major platform, but it relies on a couple of dependencies that must be installed first. These are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Java Runtime Environment v1.7</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Ruby<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">This comes preinstalled on OS X</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">For Windows, this is available from <a class="ulink" href="http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/">http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/</a></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">For Ubuntu, download this with <code class="literal">sudo apt-get install ruby2.0.0</code></li></ul></div></li></ul></div><p>With these<a id="id19" class="indexterm"/> installed, head over to the Sencha website (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.sencha.com/products/sencha-cmd/download">http://www.sencha.com/products/sencha-cmd/download</a>) to download the package relevant to your OS. Follow the instructions within the installer and you should be ready to go.</p><p>To verify<a id="id20" class="indexterm"/> that the installation has been successful, open a new Terminal or Command Prompt window and run the command <code class="literal">sencha</code>. You should see the Sencha Cmd help text appear, listing the available commands.</p></div><div class="section" title="Downloading the framework"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec13"/>Downloading the framework</h2></div></div></div><p>Before <a id="id21" class="indexterm"/>we can create our application, we must first download the Ext JS framework from the Sencha website (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/#try">http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/#try</a>). Extract this archive to a suitable location. We're now ready to create our application.</p></div><div class="section" title="Applications, packages, and workspaces"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec14"/>Applications, packages, and workspaces</h2></div></div></div><p>There <a id="id22" class="indexterm"/>are three main entities to understand when it comes to structuring<a id="id23" class="indexterm"/> your application: applications, packages, and workspaces.</p><p>An <span class="strong"><strong>application</strong></span> is a complete product that brings all your functionality and features together. Each <a id="id24" class="indexterm"/>application has its own <code class="literal">index.html</code> page and generally stands on its own.</p><p>A <span class="strong"><strong>package</strong></span> is a self-contained piece of code designed to be shared between applications and could be local to your workspace or distributed through the Sencha Package Manager and a remote repository. An example of a package may be a custom UI component.</p><p>Finally, a <span class="strong"><strong>workspace</strong></span> is a special folder that groups multiple applications and packages, allowing them to share common code and framework instances.</p></div><div class="section" title="Generating our workspace"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec15"/>Generating our workspace</h2></div></div></div><p>We <a id="id25" class="indexterm"/>will use Sencha Cmd's <code class="literal">generate</code> command to create our basic application structure, but we will start by creating a workspace.</p><p>First, we open a Terminal/Command Prompt window and navigate to the Ext JS framework folder we extracted earlier. We then run the following command:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>sencha generate workspace /your/workspace/path</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>This tells Sencha Cmd to generate a new workspace in the specified folder, which will be created if it doesn't already exist. The contents of the workspace can be seen in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/3717_01_03.jpg" alt="Generating our workspace"/></div><p>The <code class="literal">.sencha</code> folder is a hidden folder that contains configuration files that Sencha Cmd makes<a id="id26" class="indexterm"/> use of. You will only need to delve into this folder if you are customizing the build process or heavily customizing the application.</p><p>The <code class="literal">ext</code> folder contains the Ext JS framework code which our new application will make use of.</p><p>Finally, the empty <code class="literal">packages</code> folder will be the home of any packages that we choose to include. This could be user extensions, themes, or simply common code to be shared between applications.</p></div><div class="section" title="Generating our application"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec16"/>Generating our application</h2></div></div></div><p>Now <a id="id27" class="indexterm"/>that we have a workspace for our application to live in, we can create it using the <code class="literal">generate app</code> command and pass to it the name of our application and the path to the application's folder, within the workspace:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>sencha generate app BizDash /your/workspace/folder/BizDash</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>This command will create a basic application and folder structure inside a folder named <code class="literal">BizDash</code>, as shown in the following screenshot. We will explain what all the folders and files inside this folder are in the next section.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/3717_01_02.jpg" alt="Generating our application"/></div><p>This structure will form the basis of our business dashboard application.</p><p>You can navigate to the <code class="literal">index.html</code> file with your browser and see what it looks like. You should see a simple application with a tab bar and a button.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Getting production ready"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec15"/>Getting production ready</h1></div></div></div><p>Obviously, we're a long way off from the production of our application, but it is important to<a id="id28" class="indexterm"/> have things set up correctly from the start so that we can quickly deploy when we need to and have this process continually running.</p><p>When we view our application now, and monitor the file requests in the Developer Tools, we will see a lot of activity—totaling over 350 requests and 6 MB of data transfer! This is far from ideal for end users, and so, we want to combine these requests into a single minified and compressed file.</p><p>We do this by building our application with Sencha Cmd. This process will combine all of the class files used by the application (that is, the 350 requests we mentioned earlier) into a single JS file, along with other building tasks. There are two types of builds: testing and production. A testing build will combine the code but leave it unminified, whereas a production build will minify it fully.</p><p>We build the application for production with the following command:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>sencha app build production</strong></span>
</pre></div><p>This outputs our built application to the <code class="literal">build/production/BizDash</code> folder. If you load this page in your browser, you will see that the number of requests has dropped to 6 and only totals 1.3 MB. Much better!</p><p>In addition to<a id="id29" class="indexterm"/> concatenating and minifying our JavaScript, this process will compile our SASS styles, generate image sprites for older browsers, and build a cache manifest file.</p><div class="section" title="Deployment recommendations"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec17"/>Deployment recommendations</h2></div></div></div><p>Although <a id="id30" class="indexterm"/>we have already saved ourselves over 5 MB, there are still further enhancements that should be made to ensure our application loads as fast as possible. We will outline a few of these methods here, but for a more complete list, check out Google's PageSpeed or Yahoo's YSlow, which will analyze the application and make suggestions.</p><div class="section" title="GZip"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec01"/>GZip</h3></div></div></div><p>GZipping <a id="id31" class="indexterm"/>allows compression of the content sent to the browser, making it much quicker to download. This is a setting that can be enabled on most web servers.</p></div><div class="section" title="Minification and concatenation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec02"/>Minification and concatenation</h3></div></div></div><p>We<a id="id32" class="indexterm"/> have already talked about<a id="id33" class="indexterm"/> these two processes, which are taken care of by the Sencha Cmd process. However, it is important to remember when including third-party libraries and frameworks into your applications.</p></div><div class="section" title="Image optimization"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec03"/>Image optimization</h3></div></div></div><p>A lot <a id="id34" class="indexterm"/>of emphasis is placed on JavaScript size when it comes to page weight, but often, removing a single image will cut your page size in half. If images can't be removed, then make sure they are fully optimized, using a tool such as ImageOptim.</p></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Anatomy of our application"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec16"/>Anatomy of our application</h1></div></div></div><p>Let's take <a id="id35" class="indexterm"/>a step back and understand what Sencha Cmd has created in<a id="id36" class="indexterm"/> our application's folder, and where our app's code will belong:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">.sencha</code>: Our app's <code class="literal">.sencha</code> folder is similar to the one found in the workspace. The files within it allow us to gain fine-grain control over aspects of the app itself and its build process.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">app</code>: The <code class="literal">app</code> folder is where we'll spend most of our time, as it contains all of our JavaScript source code. Each of the main class types has its own folder in here by default, including controllers, models, stores, and views. New folders<a id="id37" class="indexterm"/> can be added here at any time, as required by the application.<p>Ext JS 5 introduces a new architecture concept to the framework called MVVM, which will be discussed further in a later chapter. When using this structure, we will include our ViewModels and ViewControllers in the <code class="literal">view</code> folder.</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">Application.js</code>: This file is where the application is defined and where it will be<a id="id38" class="indexterm"/> launched from. In this file, we will define which controllers, stores, and views we want to load, and the code we want to run when the browser and framework are ready.<p>You will note that there is also an <code class="literal">app.js</code> file at the root level. This file should not need to be edited and with any "application" customizations being added to <code class="literal">Application.js</code>.</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">overrides</code>: Any overrides we want to make to the framework's code can be added here.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">resources</code>: This folder will contain any assets (images, icons, fonts, and so on) that our application will make use of. These are all copied into our production <code class="literal">build</code> folder when the application is built.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">sass</code>: The <code class="literal">sass</code> folder will be the home of all of our custom SASS styling rules, which will be compiled during the Sencha Cmd build process.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">app.json</code>: Our <code class="literal">app.json</code> file contains a large number of configuration options for our application and can be used to configure things such as JavaScript and CSS files included in the build, AppCache details, and the active theme.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">build.xml</code>: This file allows us to hook into each step of the automated build process and add our own steps. This is useful if we want to customize the process to fit our workflow.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">bootstrap.css</code>, <code class="literal">bootstrap.js</code>, and <code class="literal">bootstrap.json</code>: These three files are required to launch the application, but are generated by the Sencha Cmd build process, so should not be edited by hand.</li></ul></div></div>
<div class="section" title="How it works"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec17"/>How it works</h1></div></div></div><p>At this point, we have created a working skeleton application ready to be fleshed out with our business logic and user interface, but how does the framework actually work and what does it do for us that other frameworks don't?</p><div class="section" title="The bootstrapped launch process"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec18"/>The bootstrapped launch process</h2></div></div></div><p>The <a id="id39" class="indexterm"/>process for launching and running our applications is simple with the framework taking responsibility for including all assets, in the correct order, as and when they're needed. We simply define which classes rely on which other classes, and the framework builds this relationship map for us.</p></div><div class="section" title="JavaScript to HTML"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec19"/>JavaScript to HTML</h2></div></div></div><p>Ext JS<a id="id40" class="indexterm"/> manages the entire HTML generated to display our user interface to the user. We deal primarily in JavaScript configuration of interface components that are then rendered as HTML. By doing this, we are able to be abstracted from the complex HTML and CSS that is needed to render the rich widgets perfectly across all platforms.</p></div><div class="section" title="The event system"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec20"/>The event system</h2></div></div></div><p>Ext JS<a id="id41" class="indexterm"/> classes make use of an event system that allows them to communicate seamlessly with each other. This makes it easy to keep coupling low and is perfect to simplify the handling of the asynchronous nature of JavaScript.</p></div><div class="section" title="Managing data"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec21"/>Managing data</h2></div></div></div><p>One <a id="id42" class="indexterm"/>of the big strengths of the framework is that it allows you to model your data structures and manage data within your applications effectively. The support for creating associated data models, reading and saving data to various sources, and binding interface components directly to these data sources, makes the framework extremely powerful.</p></div><div class="section" title="Browser API interaction"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec22"/>Browser API interaction</h2></div></div></div><p>There<a id="id43" class="indexterm"/> are numerous browser APIs that Ext JS abstracts and interacts with on our behalf, to simplify and unify the way we use them.
