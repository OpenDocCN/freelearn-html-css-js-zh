    is turned to the camera. Besides `THREE.MeshNormalMaterial`, we also add `THREE.MeshBasicMaterial`,

    the box. To best learn how to use the geometries, experiment with the geometries.
    Use the examples in this chapter to get to know the properties you can use to
    customize the standard set of geometries available from Three.js. It is also a
    good thing that when you start with geometries, you choose a basic material; don't
    go directly for the complex materials, but start simple with `THREE.MeshBasicMaterial`
    with the wireframe set to `true`, or `THREE.MeshNormalMaterial`. That way, you'll
    get a much better picture of the true shape of a geometry. For two-dimensional
    shapes, it's important to remember that they are placed on the *x*-*y* plane.
    If you want to have a two-dimensional shape horizontally, you'll have to rotate
    the mesh around the *x* axis for `-0.5 * PI`. And finally, take care that if you're
    rotating a two-dimensional shape, or a three-dimensional shape that is *open*
    (for example, a cylinder or a tube), remember to set the material to `THREE.DoubleSide`.
    If you don't do this, the inside or the back of your geometry won't be shown.
