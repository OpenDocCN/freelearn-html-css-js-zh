<h1 class="chapterTitle" id="_idParaDest-90">Pages and Panels to Shape Manga</h1>
<p class="normal">Now that we’ve gotten Clip Studio Paint installed and have gone over the basics of layers and brushes, in this chapter, we’ll take a closer look at our workspace. There are plenty of settings when preparing a new file that we should look at now that we’ve started creating artwork.</p>
<p class="normal">Importantly, we’ll build on what we know about layers by setting up comic panels on new pages. This process is just like setting up a studio table to work on, choosing what paper to use, and knowing the correct tools to use to create panels.</p>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Making and saving workspaces</li>
<li class="bulletList">Creating a custom-sized page and saving a preset</li>
<li class="bulletList">Adding templates to a new file</li>
<li class="bulletList">Making comic panels</li>
<li class="bulletList">Creating new files and templates</li>
<li class="bulletList">Using template panels and creating and editing them</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Let’s dive right in!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-91">Making and saving workspaces</h1>
<p class="normal">One of the best features of Clip Studio Paint is the ability to create and save different workspaces for different tasks. A workspace is a collection of palettes and their position on the interface. Clip Studio Paint comes with a few workspace options already in the program, but we can also create our own workspaces.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-92">Saving a workspace</h2>
<p class="normal">Follow these<a id="_idIndexMarker272"/> steps to create and save a workspace:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Use the directions in <em class="italic">Chapter 2</em>, <em class="italic">Installing Clip Studio Paint Pro and Interface Basics</em>, to move, collapse, and close palettes to set up a workspace. In the following screenshot, the palettes have all been moved to the left-hand side of the interface to make it easier to select items with your left hand, supposing you’re a right-handed user drawing with your right hand:</li>

<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="2">To save the <a id="_idIndexMarker273"/>current workspace, click on <strong class="screenText">Window</strong> in the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu, then go down to <strong class="screenText">Workspace</strong> and click on <strong class="screenText">Register Workspace</strong>. A box as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.2</em> will appear.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_05_02.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.2: Register Workspace box</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="3">Enter a name for the workspace in the text entry box. Then, click <strong class="screenText">OK</strong> to save the workspace settings.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">Your workspace<a id="_idIndexMarker274"/> is now saved!</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-93">Switching between workspaces</h2>
<p class="normal">Now that we’ve<a id="_idIndexMarker275"/> saved one of our own workspaces, we can switch to that workspace again whenever we like. Follow these steps to load a previously saved workspace:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Click on <strong class="screenText">Window</strong> in the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu, then go to <strong class="screenText">Workspace</strong> to see the following options:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_05_03.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">FIgure 5.3: Workspace options</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="2">To switch back to the default workspace, click on the <strong class="screenText">Reset to Default</strong> option.</li>
<li class="numberedList">To change to one of the workspaces included in Clip Studio, click on the <strong class="screenText">Illustration</strong> or <strong class="screenText">Comic</strong> option.</li>
<li class="numberedList">To load a custom workspace, locate it in the area above the <strong class="screenText">Illustration</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Comic</strong> workspace names and click on the name of the workspace to reload.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">The new workspace<a id="_idIndexMarker276"/> will be loaded.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-94">Managing and deleting workspaces</h2>
<p class="normal">Sometimes, you<a id="_idIndexMarker277"/> may want to rename or delete workspaces that you’ve saved. We can do this easily just by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">In the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu, click on <strong class="screenText">Window</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Workspace</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Manage Workspace...</strong>. The menu in <em class="italic">Figure 5.4 </em>will appear.</li>
<li class="numberedList">To delete a workspace, click on the name of the workspace on the left-hand side of the menu to highlight it in blue. Then, click on the button marked <strong class="screenText">Delete</strong> on the right-hand side.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_05_04.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.4: Manage Workspace box</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="3">To rename a workspace, click on the workspace name to highlight it in blue. Then, click on the button on the right-hand side marked <strong class="screenText">Change name of settings</strong>. Enter the new name for the workspace and click on <strong class="screenText">OK</strong> to save the new name.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">As you can see, it is easy to make new workspaces and change between them! Perhaps you want <a id="_idIndexMarker278"/>to make a workspace for drawing and inking, and another for coloring. The sky is the limit, so get creative with your workspaces and use them to maximize your workflow for efficiency.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">If you’re using a tablet or cellphone version of Clip Studio Paint, you might want a quick sketch with simple functions. In that case, you can switch between Studio Mode (the interface you are looking at now) and Simple Mode (limited tools and functions). The following diagram shows the comparison of the two different modes.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_05_05.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.5: Studio Mode and Simple Mode interfaces</p>
</div>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">The step to switch is easy: just click the Clip Studio icon in the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu, then select <strong class="screenText">Switch to Simple Mode</strong> from the drop-down menu. When you want to go back to Studio Mode again, click the three-dots icon on the top right of the screen, then select <strong class="screenText">Switch to Studio Mode</strong>.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">In the <a id="_idIndexMarker279"/>next section, we’ll start making new files and also learn about file templates.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-95">New files and templates</h1>
<p class="normal">Making a new file in<a id="_idIndexMarker280"/> most computer <a id="_idIndexMarker281"/>programs is pretty easy, and it is no different here. In Clip Studio Paint, you can simply start the program, click <strong class="screenText">Draw</strong>, and then from<strong class="keyWord"> </strong><strong class="screenText">Project</strong> select<strong class="keyWord"> </strong><strong class="screenText">Illustration</strong><strong class="keyWord">, </strong>then press <strong class="screenText">OK</strong>.<strong class="keyWord"> </strong>Now you have a blank canvas in front of you!</p>
<p class="normal">If you want to dive deeper into comic creation, there are some terminologies and options that need to be explained so that you can create files that will have the right specifications for your projects. For anyone planning to print manga later, they can be very important. In this section, we will discuss the relevant terms when creating<a id="_idIndexMarker282"/> a new file and learn how to <a id="_idIndexMarker283"/>create or load templates into new pages. Let’s get started!</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-96">The New file window – explained</h2>
<p class="normal">When first creating <a id="_idIndexMarker284"/>a new file in Clip Studio Paint, the number of options can look daunting. Not to worry though – in this section, we will learn about the most important options. That said, we can also explore each option in the new window and explain what each one means, so please feel free to choose whether you skip the parts that are not flagged as important.</p>
<p class="normal">The following screenshot shows the new file dialog box. Note that if you are using Clip Studio Paint Pro, you will not have the <strong class="screenText">Multiple pages</strong> or <strong class="screenText">Cover page</strong> settings that are available in Clip Studio Paint EX:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_05_06.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.6: New file window</p>
<p class="normal">Wow, that’s a lot of<a id="_idIndexMarker285"/> options! It can look scary at first, but let’s break it down piece by piece and talk about each option individually so that we know what they all do. The most important are flagged as<em class="italic"> important</em>, if you just want to know the crucial options:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Important: </strong><strong class="screenText">Project</strong> is the area where we can select a category from preset document options.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">The categories are <strong class="screenText">Illustration</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Webtoon</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Comic</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Printing of fanzine</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Show all comic settings</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Animation</strong>. Clicking on one of these categories changes the available settings as well as the presets, depending on which <strong class="screenText">Project</strong> category is selected. For instance, selecting the <strong class="screenText">Illustration</strong> category hides any settings related to making a comic.</p>
<p class="normal">We will look closely at the <strong class="screenText">Webtoon</strong> category in <em class="italic">Chapter 19</em>, <em class="italic">Exporting, Printing, and Uploading Your Manga</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Important:</strong><strong class="screenText"> File name</strong> is a textbox where the name of the file can be added. This field must be filled in when making multiple-page files.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Important:</strong><strong class="screenText"> Save to</strong> is the folder where a multiple-page file is saved to. To change the destination folder, click on the <strong class="screenText">Browse</strong> button to the right of the current file path.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Preset</strong> is a drop-down menu of preset page sizes and settings that correspond to the current <a id="_idIndexMarker286"/>selection made in the <strong class="screenText">Use of work</strong> section. This is also where any user-made page presets will appear. We’ll learn more about saving our page settings in an upcoming section.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Important:</strong><strong class="screenText"> Unit</strong> is where we can set the unit of measurement for the page. In the preceding screenshot, it is set to <strong class="screenText">mm</strong>. It can be set to <strong class="screenText">cm</strong>, <strong class="screenText">in</strong>, <strong class="screenText">px</strong>, or <strong class="screenText">pt</strong> via the drop-down menu.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">In the <strong class="screenText">Canvas</strong> section, we have several options. <strong class="screenText">Width</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Height</strong> are the measurements of the new canvas that will be produced, in whatever unit of measurement is set in the <strong class="screenText">Unit</strong> drop-down menu. These can be adjusted either via the arrows to the right of the textbox, or we can click inside the box and simply type in a new measurement. To switch the measurements for the height and width, click on the curved double-headed arrow button to the left of the <strong class="screenText">Width</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Height</strong> boxes.</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Important:</strong><strong class="screenText"> Resolution</strong> is where you can set the resolution in dpi for the new document. For print projects, this should be at least 300 dpi.</li>
</ul>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Create all of your projects in at least 300 dpi (or larger, if your computer can handle it!) so that you never have to redo something if you decide after making it that you want to print it. Images with low resolution will look pixelated and blurry when printed.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Basic expression color</strong> is where you can set the default expression color of the image. <strong class="screenText">Basic expression color</strong> can be changed via individual<a id="_idIndexMarker287"/> layers in the image later, no matter what the expression color is set to during this step. However, if you are creating a pure black and white or grayscale image, it can save time (and file space!).</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Paper color</strong> is where you can set a default paper color. Activating the checkbox here will create a <strong class="screenText">Paper</strong> layer in the file with the indicated paper color as a fill. This paper color can be edited later. If the paper color is not active, then the new file will be transparent.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Template</strong> is the checkbox where we can load a template into the new file. We’ll discuss templates more in the next section.</li>
<li class="bulletList">The <strong class="screenText">Comic Settings</strong> section activates the <strong class="screenText">Binding (finish) size</strong> and border size options. Let’s discuss the <strong class="screenText">Binding (finish) size</strong> and border size options in more detail:</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Binding (finish) size</strong> is the dimensions of the finished page after printing. In printing, we have a bleed area that is cut off the edges of paper after documents are printed. This is how a full bleed (an image going off the edge of the paper) is achieved:<ul>
<li class="bulletList level-2">The <strong class="screenText">Width</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Height</strong> settings in the Canvas area should be the paper size, including any bleed area.</li>
<li class="bulletList level-2">The <strong class="screenText">Binding (finish) size</strong> <strong class="screenText">Width</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Height</strong> should be the finished dimensions of the page after trimming has occurred. For instance, if we had a 6 x 9-inch finished page with a .25-inch bleed margin, then we would need to add .25 inches to all four sides of the paper.</li>
<li class="bulletList level-2">This would make our canvas <strong class="screenText">Width</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Height</strong> 6.5 x 9.5 inches, but our <strong class="screenText">Binding (finish) size</strong> would be 6 x 9 inches.</li>
<li class="bulletList level-2">Preset finish sizes can be selected from the drop-down menu or entered manually via the text entry boxes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Default border (inner) size</strong> is the size of the margin on the finished page. This is sometimes called the safe area. We want to keep any important elements of the art in a comic or other printed design away from the very edges of the page, especially when doing a bleed. This is because<a id="_idIndexMarker288"/> the very edges of the paper are cut down to the finished size, and sometimes those cuts aren’t precise. Having text or other important elements too close to the edge can result in those things getting cut off! As with the binding size, the border size can be selected from the drop-down menu or entered manually in the textboxes.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">X offset and Y offset</strong> are used to offset the border to the left, right, up, or down. This feature is very handy if you need to move the margins to the left or right to compensate for the binding of a book, or if you want to move the inner border up slightly to allow for page numbers or notes at the bottom of the page.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Align crop mark </strong>is used to align crop marks on two-page spreads. When you turn it on, the crop marks are combined by aligning the positions of the cropped border. The position of the cropped border on the left and right pages can be adjusted by typing numbers in the <strong class="screenText">Gap</strong> section. When it’s off, crop marks are created at the position where the paper edges of the left and right pages match.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Safety margin</strong> is a border for manuscripts printed in multiple formats, showing the areas that will be printed in all formats. When it’s on, the safety margin border will be shown in green on a canvas.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Setting for fanzine</strong> is used to export work with data capable of being used by a fanzine printer. This option is used mainly for Japanese doujinshi.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Multiple pages</strong> is an option that’s only available in Clip Studio Paint EX. Checking this box allows you to make a file with multiple page files nested in it. This option is invaluable for anyone making longer-chapter comics. By using a multiple-page file, you can look at all the pages in the file at once, check the flow of the work, and rearrange, delete, or add pages.</li>
<li class="bulletList">The <strong class="screenText">Number of pages</strong> box controls how many pages should be created in<a id="_idIndexMarker289"/> the new file and can be set either using the downward pointing arrow to the right of the text entry box or by typing in a number manually:<ul>
<li class="bulletList level-2">You can select how you want to view the pages, with either <strong class="screenText">Page-by-page</strong> (like bound books) or <strong class="screenText">Webtoon</strong> (vertical scrolling).</li>
<li class="bulletList level-2">The setting and <strong class="screenText">Story</strong> window will change depending on the view you selected.</li>
<li class="bulletList level-2">The <strong class="screenText">Combine into two-page spreads </strong>checkbox will turn facing pages into a two-page spread automatically.</li>
<li class="bulletList level-2"><strong class="screenText">Binding point</strong> controls which side of the book the binding will be on. For instance, English books are bound with the spine on the left-hand side while Japanese books have the spine on the right.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">When creating a multiple-page file, the <strong class="screenText">Cover page</strong> option can be used. When active, this creates a front and back cover for the file. Note that these covers are included in the page count. Therefore, a 24-page file will yield 20 inner pages, a front outside cover, a front inside cover, a back inside cover, and a back outside cover. Just like when setting up the rest of the canvas, <strong class="screenText">Resolution</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Color</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Paper color</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Template</strong> can also be set for the cover.</p>
<p class="normal">There are also two options for <strong class="screenText">Cover page layout</strong>. The first icon is to make the cover a two-page spread so that the back and front of the cover are one continuous page and can both be designed and drawn on at the same time. When this option is selected, the <strong class="screenText">Specify spine width</strong> option can be used to set the width of the spine of the finished book so that the appropriate width spine can be added to the cover. The icon on the right under <strong class="screenText">Cover page layout</strong> separates the cover<a id="_idIndexMarker290"/> pages into individual pages.</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">The <strong class="screenText">Story information</strong> section of the <strong class="screenText">New</strong> file window is optional but can be very helpful, especially if working with a team or when sending files out to a printer. <strong class="screenText">Story name</strong> allows you to enter the name of your story. The drop-down menu to the right of the text entry box controls where the story name will appear on the new page. By activating the <strong class="screenText">Number of stories</strong> checkbox, the number of the current story can be entered.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal-one">The <strong class="screenText">Subtitle</strong> textbox can be used to add any additional title information. The <strong class="screenText">Author</strong> box can be used to add the name of the author of the comic story, and the drop-down menu to the right can be used to determine where on the page to display the author’s name. By activating the <strong class="screenText">Page number</strong> checkbox, a page number will be displayed automatically in the bleed area of the pages. The drop-down menu to the right of the <strong class="screenText">Page number</strong> checkbox can be used to control where to display this number. The <strong class="screenText">Start number</strong> box is used to indicate what number should be the first in the number series.</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">The <strong class="screenText">Folio</strong> section of the <strong class="screenText">New File</strong> window is where folio information can be added to new pages. Folio is another name for page numbering. The <strong class="screenText">Folio</strong> option will leave visible page numbers on the new pages, inside of the bleed area. <strong class="screenText">Start number</strong> allows us to set the number to begin the page numbering with. The color of the page number can be set with the <strong class="screenText">Color</strong> drop-down menu. To add a stroke to the outside of the page numbers, activate the <strong class="screenText">Put edges</strong> checkbox and then indicate the desired thickness of the outline in the text entry box to the right. The <strong class="screenText">Folio</strong> checkbox is used to activate the <strong class="screenText">Folio</strong> options and indicate that folio information should be included in the new file.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">The drop-down menu to the right of the checkbox allows you to customize where the page number shows up on the page. The <strong class="screenText">Format</strong> text entry boxes are used to format any text around the page number (for instance, Page 1 of 35 could be entered in the text entry boxes). <strong class="screenText">Gap with default border</strong> is used to set the gap between the folio information and the default border of the page. The larger the number<a id="_idIndexMarker291"/> in the gap options, the larger the space between the folio information and the default borderline. The <strong class="screenText">Font</strong> drop-down menu allows us to set the desired font to use for the folio information, and the <strong class="screenText">Size</strong> option next to it sets the size of the folio text. <em class="italic">Figure 5.7</em> is a screenshot of the <strong class="screenText">Folio</strong> section.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_05_07.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.7: Folio section of the New file window</p>
<p class="normal">There is a <strong class="screenText">Blind folio</strong> checkbox underneath. <strong class="screenText">Blind folio</strong> puts a page number on the inside edge of the page, where the spine would be when the pages are bound into a book. These folio numbers are not visible when the book is bound.</p>
<p class="normal">Finally, if you wish to record a timelapse of your manga creation, click the <strong class="screenText">Record timelapse</strong> checkbox at the very bottom of the window underneath the <strong class="screenText">Multiple pages</strong> section, as<a id="_idIndexMarker292"/> shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.8</em>. It will allow you to record and share the timelapse.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_05_08.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.8: Timelapse section of the New file window</p>
<p class="normal">Now that we know what all of these terms and options are, we can make a new page! In the next section, we are going to create a custom page, sized to the standard American <a id="_idIndexMarker293"/>comic book size paper with the recommended margins. We will save this page as a preset and then create a new file with a template added to it as well. Let’s get started!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-97">Creating a basic square canvas</h1>
<p class="normal">Let’s start out by <a id="_idIndexMarker294"/>creating a basic illustration canvas, before <a id="_idIndexMarker295"/>we learn how to create custom pages for manga. It is pretty easy by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Go to <strong class="screenText">File</strong> | <strong class="screenText">New</strong> or press <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">N</em> to open the <strong class="screenText">New</strong> dialog box.</li>
<li class="numberedList">In the <strong class="screenText">Project</strong> section, click on the <strong class="screenText">Illustration</strong> icon on the far left.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Set <strong class="screenText">Unit</strong> as <strong class="screenText">px</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Width</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Height</strong> as <code class="inlineCode">1000</code>, and <strong class="screenText">Resolution</strong> as <code class="inlineCode">300</code>.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Set <strong class="screenText">Basic expression color</strong> as <strong class="screenText">Color</strong>, then press <strong class="screenText">OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">Now you have a nice square canvas in front of you to draw anything!</p>
<p class="normal">Once you’re ready to try controlling the specifications, we can move on to more precise<a id="_idIndexMarker296"/> file<a id="_idIndexMarker297"/> settings.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-98">Creating a custom-sized page and saving a preset</h1>
<p class="normal">While it<a id="_idIndexMarker298"/> provides <a id="_idIndexMarker299"/>Japanese <a id="_idIndexMarker300"/>and European<a id="_idIndexMarker301"/> comic sizes, Clip Studio Paint doesn’t come with the sizes that are common to American comic books. We are going to create a standard American comic book size page and save it as a preset for use later. Follow these steps to complete this activity:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Go to <strong class="screenText">File</strong> | <strong class="screenText">New</strong> or press <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">N</em> to open the <strong class="screenText">New</strong> dialog box.</li>

<li class="numberedList">In the <strong class="screenText">Height</strong> entry box, enter <code class="inlineCode">10.50</code>.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Set <strong class="screenText">Resolution</strong> to <code class="inlineCode">300</code> dpi (or more, depending on your computer hardware).</li>
<li class="numberedList">Set <strong class="screenText">Basic expression color</strong>. I usually leave this as <strong class="screenText">Color</strong>, but if the majority of your work is in black and white or grayscale, you may wish to choose a different mode. Individual layers can be adjusted later in the file, so even if we choose grayscale mode in this step, we will still be able to color our work later if we decide to.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Set <strong class="screenText">Paper Color</strong> by clicking on the checkbox if it’s not checked already, then click on the color selector box to choose the paper color. For this example, we will be leaving the paper color white.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click the checkbox next to <strong class="screenText">Comic settings</strong> to activate it if it is not already active. In <strong class="screenText">Binding (finish) size</strong>, enter <code class="inlineCode">6.75</code> for <strong class="screenText">Width</strong> and <code class="inlineCode">10.25</code> for <strong class="screenText">Height</strong>.</li>

<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-99">Adding templates to a new file</h1>
<p class="normal">Templates can<a id="_idIndexMarker314"/> save a lot of time. For<a id="_idIndexMarker315"/> instance, if you are making a series of comics that all have the same four-panel layout, then by using Clip Studio Paint EX, you can make a multiple-page file and load the four panels into every page of the file upon creation, saving valuable time! No matter whether you’re using the Pro or the EX version, though, using templates can save a lot of tedious work. So, let’s learn how to load a page template into a new file by following these simple steps:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Open the <strong class="screenText">New</strong> dialog box by going to <strong class="screenText">File</strong> | <strong class="screenText">New</strong> (or press <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">N</em>).</li>
<li class="numberedList">If you saved the preset page from the previous exercise, now is a great time to try it out by selecting it from the <strong class="screenText">Preset</strong> drop-down menu.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Under the <strong class="screenText">Canvas</strong> section, click the checkbox next to the word <strong class="screenText">Template</strong>. This will bring up the <strong class="screenText">Template</strong> dialog box.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Scroll down through the template selections to find the desired template. For this example, we will be using the <strong class="screenText">4 frames 2 strips with titles</strong> template. Click on the template to select it.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on <strong class="screenText">OK</strong> in the <strong class="screenText">Template</strong> window. Now, the chosen template will be shown next to the <strong class="screenText">Template</strong> checkbox. To change to a different template, click on the button with the name of the current template on it to bring the <strong class="screenText">Template</strong> dialog box up again.</li>
<li class="numberedList">For EX users, check the box next to the <strong class="screenText">Multiple pages</strong> option. In the drop-down menu, select <strong class="screenText">8</strong> as the number of pages. Add a title in the <strong class="screenText">File name</strong> textbox at the top of the window, and choose a folder to save the new file in.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Your screen should now look something like <em class="italic">Figure 5.11</em>. Click on <strong class="screenText">OK</strong> to create the new file.</li>

<p class="normal">Wow, now you have comic pages in front of you to work on! And you know how to use panel <a id="_idIndexMarker318"/>templates. Shall <a id="_idIndexMarker319"/>we proceed to the next stage – making your own comic panels?</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-100">Making comic panels</h1>
<p class="normal">It’s always faster to <a id="_idIndexMarker320"/>use already prepared templates for manga<a id="_idIndexMarker321"/> panels, but if you need to create your own, there is a variety of tools and options for frame border layers. These frame borders make comic panels – the individual boxes that each piece of sequential art in a story is drawn inside of. </p>
<p class="normal">These frame border layers can be created easily, edited in just a few clicks, and even set to mask out any content outside of the panel – which makes for a much easier drawing experience. If you want to know more about layers, check out <em class="italic">Chapter 3</em>, <em class="italic">Penciling: Layer and Layer Property Palettes</em>.</p>
<p class="normal">For now, let’s start making some comic panels!</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-101">What are frame border layers?</h2>
<p class="normal">First of all, frame <a id="_idIndexMarker322"/>border layers are what Clip Studio <a id="_idIndexMarker323"/>Paint calls the specific type of layers that it makes comic panels from. Panels in comics are like shots in a movie or TV show. They contain the action and can also give a sense of the amount of time that’s passed or how much weight the action carries. Panels can also bring lots of drama and excitement to a page and can lead the reader’s eye around the composition, telling them what is important and what they should be looking at.</p>
<p class="normal">Panel layouts can be straightforward or much more detailed. Let’s take a look at a few comic panel examples, along with the way that their frame border layers are laid out in the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette.</p>
<p class="normal">The following image is the first example of three panels on one page:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_05_13.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.13: Manga page and the Layer palette 1</p>
<p class="normal">In a quiet, conversational-based <a id="_idIndexMarker324"/>storytelling layout, time<a id="_idIndexMarker325"/> passes at a consistent tempo. So, we use roughly the same-sized frames to indicate a stable passing of time. In the example shown here, there are two people talking. A girl is sitting; we can see her full body on the first panel, then the close-up of her face on the second panel (it is Japanese style, so it reads from right to left), and a boy is slowly leaving the place.</p>
<p class="normal">In the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette at the bottom right of the screenshot, you will see the various frames of the comic. Each panel is created in its own frame or frame border folder, and you can tell which panel it is by looking at the black and white mask of each of the layers. (For more information on layer masks, see <em class="italic">Chapter 12</em>, <em class="italic">Making Layer Masks and Screentones</em>.) The following screenshot shows another example of comic paneling:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_05_14.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.14: Manga page and the Layer palette 2</p>
<p class="normal">In the <a id="_idIndexMarker326"/>preceding <a id="_idIndexMarker327"/>example, the characters are involved in more actions than in the previous image! The bottom two frames depict the disappearing body of a boy, showing the two characters at the same angle. These two frames stay within the inner border of the page, but the top panel has been extended out beyond the margins to create a dynamic action scene of the characters.</p>
<p class="normal">This is called a <strong class="screenText">bleed</strong>, as we discussed earlier in the <em class="italic">The New file window – explained </em>section. It refers to any art that goes off the edge of the page. When printed, the paper will be trimmed down to the final finished size so that there is no white margin around the edge of the paper. This trimming of the paper after printing occurs in traditional book publishing, which is why we must always keep the interior margins of the page (<strong class="screenText">Default Bordersize</strong> in the <strong class="screenText">New</strong> file options in Clip Studio Paint – see <em class="italic">Chapter 2</em>, <em class="italic">Installing Clip Studio Paint Pro and Interface Basics</em>, for more information on creating a new file) in mind. Artwork, text, and anything else <a id="_idIndexMarker328"/>that is too close to the edge of the page <a id="_idIndexMarker329"/>are at risk of being cut off in the trimming process, so it is a good idea to keep anything important, such as dialog and speech balloons, inside the inner margins at all times.</p>
<p class="normal">Here is a third example of a comic panel layout, along with its corresponding <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette from Clip Studio Paint:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_05_15.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.15: Manga page and the Layer palette 3</p>
<p class="normal">It is a page showing<a id="_idIndexMarker330"/> the girl’s confession of her indulgence<a id="_idIndexMarker331"/> in blind love, symbolized by the puppy in the middle of the page. The panels are round shapes that soften the impression of the page as it’s told in a dreamy state of mind. Believe it or not, this set of panels was just as easy to create as the other panel examples; it just required a little bit of pre-planning to keep everything together!</p>
<p class="normal">Of course, these three examples do not cover the entire spectrum of comic book paneling. Just like shooting a movie, there are countless ways to tell a story. Page compositions depend on the style of the artist and the type of story they are telling to inform the style of paneling.</p>
<p class="normal">So, now tha<a id="_idIndexMarker332"/>t we’ve <a id="_idIndexMarker333"/>talked about panels and what they are, let’s get into the tools we use to make them.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-102">Creating, editing, and using template panels</h1>
<p class="normal">In order to create <a id="_idIndexMarker334"/>frame <a id="_idIndexMarker335"/>border<a id="_idIndexMarker336"/> panels, you will need an open page. I<a id="_idIndexMarker337"/> recommend<a id="_idIndexMarker338"/> using <a id="_idIndexMarker339"/>one of the templates under the comic category to test out the panel creation tools, but use any size canvas that you feel comfortable with! I recommend the comic templates because they already have the inner border size set, so it’s easy to see where you should keep the panels to avoid them getting cut off.</p>
<p class="normal">Before we get into actually creating some panels, let’s take a look at the subtools used to make them and some of the options for those subtools. The <strong class="screenText">Frame Border</strong> subtools can be found under the <strong class="screenText">Figure</strong> category of tools in the toolbar. These subtools are shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.16</em>.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_05_16.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.16: Create frame subtools</p>
<p class="normal">In <a id="_idIndexMarker340"/>this <a id="_idIndexMarker341"/>section, we <a id="_idIndexMarker342"/>are <a id="_idIndexMarker343"/>going <a id="_idIndexMarker344"/>to concentrate<a id="_idIndexMarker345"/> on the <strong class="screenText">Rectangle frame</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Polyline frame</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Frame border pen</strong> tools. We will discuss the other two types of subtools in the <em class="italic">Dividing and editing panels</em> section coming up later in this chapter.</p>
<p class="normal"><em class="italic">Figure 5.17</em> shows the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> options for the <strong class="screenText">Rectangle frame</strong> subtool. The list that <a id="_idIndexMarker346"/>follows <a id="_idIndexMarker347"/>provides<a id="_idIndexMarker348"/> details <a id="_idIndexMarker349"/>about<a id="_idIndexMarker350"/> each <a id="_idIndexMarker351"/>of these options:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Draw border</strong>: This checkbox controls whether a line is drawn around the outside of the created frame or not. When unchecked, Clip Studio Paint will create a panel with no outline.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">How to add</strong>: The options under this drop-down menu are <strong class="screenText">Create a new folder</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Add to selected folder</strong>. Depending on the setting selected, new panels will either be made in a folder of their own or will be created all in the same folder. We will discuss this more in the next section of this chapter.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Raster layer</strong>: When checked, this option will automatically create a new raster layer underneath the new panel folder.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Fill inside the frame</strong>: Automatically creates a background fill layer in the new frame.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Aspect type</strong>: When checked, this option controls the aspect ratio of the created panel with either a set ratio or a set length. For example, to create frames that are all exactly the same size, that size can be specified by setting <strong class="screenText">Width</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Height</strong> under the <strong class="screenText">Set Length</strong> option.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Brush Size</strong>: Controls the thickness of the created border outline.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Anti-aliasing</strong>: Sets the anti-aliasing of the border outline.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Brush shape</strong>: Controls the brush used to draw the outside border. For example, a border of dashed lines or hearts can be set using this drop-down menu.</li>
</ul>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.17: Rectangle frame subtool</p>
<p class="normal">Now that we know a<a id="_idIndexMarker352"/> little<a id="_idIndexMarker353"/> about<a id="_idIndexMarker354"/> the panel options, let’s create some panels<a id="_idIndexMarker355"/> using<a id="_idIndexMarker356"/> the <a id="_idIndexMarker357"/>first three subtools in the <strong class="screenText">Frame border</strong> category.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-103">Using the Rectangle frame tool</h2>
<p class="normal">Follow these<a id="_idIndexMarker358"/> steps to create a comic <a id="_idIndexMarker359"/>panel using the <strong class="screenText">Rectangle frame</strong> tool:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Select the <strong class="screenText">Rectangle frame</strong> tool from the <strong class="screenText">Frame border</strong> category.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Edit the tool properties to your desired settings.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Decide where you want your panel to be located on your open page.</li>

<li class="numberedList">Repeat to create additional panels.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Rectangle frame</strong> tool can be used to create circle- and polygon-shaped panels, as well as squares and rectangles. Simply click on the icon at the bottom of the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> <a id="_idIndexMarker360"/>palette to bring up the<a id="_idIndexMarker361"/> screen shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.18</em>.</p>

</div>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-104">Using the Polyline frame tool</h2>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Polyline frame</strong> tool <a id="_idIndexMarker364"/>allows us to create <a id="_idIndexMarker365"/>more complicated and irregularly shaped frames.</p>
<p class="normal">Select the <strong class="screenText">Polyline frame</strong> tool and look at the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette. If the <strong class="screenText">Curve</strong> options are not visible, they can be accessed through the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool Detail</strong> palette, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5.19</em>.</p>
<p class="normal">The very first icon will produce straight lines between the points of your frame, and the second option is the <strong class="screenText">Spline</strong> setting, which will create curves between each point of the frame. To use either of these options, simply click on the point in the canvas where you want the frame to start. Then, click again where the second point should be. Continue clicking on each corner of the frame until you reach the starting point and double-click to finish the frame.</p>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.20: Frames made using the Straight line option</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-105">Using the Quadratic Bezier option</h2>
<p class="normal">Using the <strong class="screenText">Quadratic Bezier</strong> option<a id="_idIndexMarker370"/> for a panel <a id="_idIndexMarker371"/>takes a little getting used to and usually requires some refinement after the initial points are laid out. Follow these steps to create a curved panel with Quadratic Bezier:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Select <strong class="screenText">Polyline frame</strong> and then the Quadratic Bezier option from the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on the canvas once, at the point where you’d like the frame to start.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on the point where you would like the frame to start curving. This will create a small square handle at the clicked point.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Move the cursor to another point on the canvas. The line of the frame will bend according to where the second click was placed and where the cursor is now.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Continue clicking to add boxes and curves to the frame until it is the desired length. Double-click to end the frame when the starting point is reached.</li>
<li class="numberedList">To adjust the frame, select the <strong class="screenText">Operation</strong> category of tools and then the <strong class="screenText">Object</strong> tool in its category. Click on the frame outline to select it and reveal the handle controls. In <em class="italic">Figure 5.21</em>, on the left image, the control handles are on the straight lines and the frame has the curved lines.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_05_21.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.21: Frames made using the Quadratic Bezier line option</p>
<p class="normal">The right side of the preceding screenshot is a sample panel depicting a character’s patchy memory, where the character only remembers parts of what they saw. This<a id="_idIndexMarker372"/> has been done by creating <a id="_idIndexMarker373"/>abstract shapes with the <strong class="screenText">Quadratic Bezier</strong> option. This tool has its own way of handling the shape. You can try moving each point to see how the tool modifies the shape!</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-106">Using the Cubic Bezier option</h2>
<p class="normal">Another option<a id="_idIndexMarker374"/> for making curved frames is <a id="_idIndexMarker375"/>using the Cubic Bezier setting. Follow these steps to create a frame using Cubic Bezier:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Select the <strong class="screenText">Cubic Bezier</strong> setting from the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette of the <strong class="screenText">Polyline frame</strong> tool.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on the first point of the frame.</li>
<li class="numberedList">When clicking to add the first curve, hold down the mouse button and drag it in the direction your line is going. (For example, if you are starting on the left-hand side of the canvas and heading toward the right, drag the mouse to the right while holding down the button. Going in the direction of the line will prevent the control handles from reversing and making “snarls” in the line.) The line between the two clicked points will curve.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on a third point and drag with the mouse while holding down the button to continue making the curve.</li>
<li class="numberedList">To end the frame creation process, click on the starting point to enclose the frame.</li>
<li class="numberedList">To edit the Cubic Bezier frame, select the <strong class="screenText">Operation</strong> category of tools and select the <strong class="screenText">Object</strong> tool. Click on the frame to reveal the control handles. The control <a id="_idIndexMarker376"/>handles are shown by the <a id="_idIndexMarker377"/>red lines on the left image in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_05_22.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.22: Frames made using the Cubic Bezier line option</p>
<p class="normal">Cubic Bezier has a unique function with the red handles: they make it possible to create the exact smooth shape you need! In the image on the right, the scene captures a memory inside a man’s silhouette. This is an example of how a panel can depict a past scene (in the character’s memory) within a modern-day image (the silhouette<a id="_idIndexMarker378"/> of the<a id="_idIndexMarker379"/> man in a hat).</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-107">Using the Frame border pen</h2>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Frame border pen</strong> is a<a id="_idIndexMarker380"/> versatile tool that<a id="_idIndexMarker381"/> allows you to freehand any shape into a frame border. It’s so easy to use!</p>
<p class="normal">Follow these steps to create a frame with the Frame border pen:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Select the <strong class="screenText">Frame border pen</strong> subtool from the <strong class="screenText">Frame border</strong> category.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Using the mouse or tablet stylus, draw the desired shape for the panel outline.</li>
<li class="numberedList">When the entire shape is enclosed, release the pressure on the mouse button or stylus tip to complete the frame creation process.</li>
<li class="numberedList">As shown in the following screenshot, more complex frame shapes can be made with the Frame border pen tool than with the other frame creation tools.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_05_23.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.23: Frames made using the Frame border pen option</p>
<p class="normal">The Frame border pen is for more complicated shapes and is easy for just drawing freehand! It will give you more freedom with panel shapes. On the right-hand side <a id="_idIndexMarker382"/>of the preceding screenshot, you <a id="_idIndexMarker383"/>can see a frame border of eerie blood streams created by the Frame border pen.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-108">One layer and many panels, or one layer for each panel?</h2>
<p class="normal">You may be<a id="_idIndexMarker384"/> wondering: why use the <strong class="screenText">Frame Border</strong> tools to<a id="_idIndexMarker385"/> create panels when we can use the various shape tools to simply draw a border and create our art inside of it?</p>
<p class="normal">Frame Border panels come with a feature that makes them a lot more convenient than just using the <strong class="screenText">Direct Draw</strong> tools to make a square and drawing your comic art inside of it. As you may have noticed from the screenshots, the outsides of the comic borders are shaded in purple. This is because the frame borders are made with a layer mask automatically on the outside of them. Because of this layer mask, we can create artwork that goes outside of the panel but that is automatically cleaned up. For instance, let’s look at the images in <em class="italic">Figure 5.24</em>.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_05_24.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.24: Drawing and the same image with a panel</p>
<p class="normal">The line on the left was drawn quite big, and in the right image, only the parts of the line inside the frame border panel are visible. Because of this layer mask, we don’t need to spend time tediously making sure that our art doesn’t go outside of the panels.</p>
<p class="normal">However, we can create our panels either all on their own layer or with every panel on the same layer. In <em class="italic">Figure 5.25</em>, one panel has been created on its own layer and <a id="_idIndexMarker386"/>two<a id="_idIndexMarker387"/> more panels have been created on the same layer.</p>
<p class="normal">You can see the outlines of each layer by looking at the black and white layer mask icons to the left of the layer names. The <strong class="screenText">Frame 1</strong> layer contains one panel at the top, while the <strong class="screenText">Frame 2</strong> layer contains a panel at the bottom left, and also the bottom right. These were created by toggling between the two options in the <strong class="screenText">How to add</strong> drop-down menu in the Tool Properties for the <strong class="screenText">Rectangle frame</strong> tool.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_05_25.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.25: A layer with Frame Border panels</p>
<p class="normal">As shown on the left-hand side of <em class="italic">Figure 5.26</em>, the <strong class="screenText">Frame 1</strong> layer allows us to see only what is inside the attached layer mask. The other two panels are shaded <a id="_idIndexMarker388"/>out <a id="_idIndexMarker389"/>and the contents of those frames will not be visible, and not affected when you draw.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_05_26.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.26: Page with different layers selected</p>
<p class="normal">If we create all our panels on separate layers, then each will be independent of the others. However, with panels created on the same layer, artwork can be shown in multiple panels continuously, so you don’t need to switch layers every time you are inking a different panel. Fewer steps, less hassle!</p>
<p class="normal">Ultimately, the decision of whether to put all your frames on their own layers or all on one layer is yours to make. Putting each on its own layer means more layers to manage and more clicking around to complete your comic page. But putting them all on one layer means managing more of your creation process to ensure that artwork is only in the frame it’s supposed to be in.</p>
<p class="normal">Personally, I work more comfortably using only one or two panel layers, just because there are fewer layers to toggle around, and it can make the work simple. But of course, the right choice for you will depend on your working style and preferences. This is especially true when you’re working on commissions and need to do a quick amendment of the panel order; it saves a lot of time having each panel in a separate layer so you can move the panel layer folders instead of re-drawing the contents!</p>
<p class="normal">You now know why <a id="_idIndexMarker390"/>we<a id="_idIndexMarker391"/> need frame border panels, and how to create them in various ways. If the panel shape you have created is not entirely as you desired, don’t panic; you can always edit it! Read on to find out how.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-109">Dividing and editing panels</h1>
<p class="normal">A big advantage <a id="_idIndexMarker392"/>to working in the digital realm is the <a id="_idIndexMarker393"/>ability to make edits on the fly. Yes, our frame border panels can be edited even after we’ve created them. Resizing, rotating, and even completely changing the position of our frames is possible, as is adding a new one or deleting one entirely. In this section, we will learn how to modify the frames we’ve created.</p>
<p class="normal">If you haven’t created panels already, follow the instructions in the <em class="italic">Making comic panels</em> section of this chapter and put some panels on a page!</p>
<p class="normal">To resize a comic panel, you’ll need to first select the <strong class="screenText">Object</strong> tool from the <strong class="screenText">Operation</strong> category of tools. Then click on the outside edge of the comic panel to select it. When selected, a red line will show along the outline of the panel, as well as some light-blue handles and small yellow arrows. Around the outside edge of the panel, a rectangle with a light-blue handle at each corner and a handle at the center top will also show.</p>
<p class="normal">To resize the panel manually, click on one of the light-blue handles and drag. Once the desired size is reached, let go of the mouse button.</p>
<p class="normal">The small yellow arrows can also be used to resize a panel quickly. Clicking on one of the yellow arrows will automatically either take that edge of the panel out to the same size as a nearby panel (if there are any nearby panels) or take that side of the panel to the edge of the page. In <em class="italic">Figure 5.27</em>, the yellow arrow on the left-hand side of the panel was used to quickly make the panel bleed off <a id="_idIndexMarker394"/>the <a id="_idIndexMarker395"/>edge of the page.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_05_27.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.27: Panel resizing</p>
<p class="normal">Rotating a panel is just as simple as resizing one! To rotate a panel, simply move the mouse over the light-blue handle sticking up outside of the bounding box at the top of the panel. The cursor will change to a curved double-headed arrow once it is in the correct position for rotating. Click and drag to rotate the panel to the desired position. In <em class="italic">Figure 5.28</em>, the handle was used to rotate the panel clockwise.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_05_28.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.28: Panel rotating</p>
<p class="normal">To move the<a id="_idIndexMarker396"/> selected panel, put the <strong class="screenText">Object</strong> tool over the<a id="_idIndexMarker397"/> red outline around the edge of the panel. Click and drag to move the panel to the new location. Release the button once the new position is reached to stop moving the panel. <em class="italic">Figure 5.29</em> shows that the panel edges have been moved down and to the right from their starting position.</p>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.29: Panel expanding</p>
<p class="normal">So now you know<a id="_idIndexMarker398"/> you can move/edit panels<a id="_idIndexMarker399"/> around even after you have already drawn artwork. Phew, what a relief!</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-110">Dividing existing frames</h2>
<p class="normal">Remember how I said <a id="_idIndexMarker400"/>earlier that we would cover the <strong class="screenText">Divide frame folder</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Divide frame border</strong> tools later? Now is the time!</p>
<p class="normal">With these tools, it is easy to cut a whole framed page into pieces, rather than creating each frame using frame drawing tools. The <strong class="keyWord">Divide frame folder </strong>and <strong class="keyWord">Divide frame border </strong>tools can <a id="_idIndexMarker401"/>take one frame and turn it into two. But, just as their names suggest, they each perform that division a little differently.</p>
<p class="normal">Earlier, we discussed how we can either make our frames all on one layer or each on their own layer. These two dividing tools divide the existing frames into either separate layers or frames all on one layer. Let’s look at each tool and how to use it.</p>
<p class="normal"><em class="italic">Figure 5.30</em><em class="italic"><a id="_idIndexMarker402"/></em> shows the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette for the <strong class="screenText">Divide frame folder</strong> tool. In the following list, you <a id="_idIndexMarker403"/>will find a description of each of these settings:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_05_30.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.30: Tool property palette of the Divide frame folder tool</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Shape of division</strong>: Controls how the panel is divided. The options are <strong class="screenText">Divide by straight line</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Divide by polyline</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Divide by spline</strong>. Using the straight-line option will produce a panel division that is one straight line. Polyline division allows us to create a panel division using a segmented line. The spline division option allows us to create a curved panel division.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Dividing method</strong>: Controls how the panel division operation is carried out. The options are <strong class="screenText">Divide frame folder and duplicate inside layer</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Divide frame folder and create empty layer</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Divide not folder but frame border</strong>. The first two options will create a new panel folder after the division is completed, but the first option will duplicate the layer inside the existing panel, while the second will create an empty layer inside the folder.</li>
</ul>
<p class="bulletList">The third option turns the <strong class="screenText">Divide frame folder</strong> tool into the <strong class="screenText">Divide frame border</strong> tool by splitting the frame but keeping both new frames on the same layer.</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Space of frame border in Preferences</strong>: Uses the value set in the program preferences to set the gutter space between panels.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Vertical gutter</strong>: When the option to use program preferences isn’t in use, this sets the width of the vertical gap between panels.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Horizontal gutter</strong>: When the preceding option is not checked, this sets the height of the horizontal gap between panels.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Using the <strong class="screenText">Divide frame folder</strong> tool is easy. Simply select the tool and click on or near the edge of <a id="_idIndexMarker404"/>the panel to divide. While holding<a id="_idIndexMarker405"/> down the mouse button or stylus, drag to where you want to divide the panel. A set of lines will show a preview of the panel division so you can see exactly what your new panels will look like. Once the preview lines are in the correct spot, release the mouse button to complete the division.</p>
<p class="normal">In <em class="italic">Figure 5.31</em>, our panel has been divided into two panels, each in its own folder. This comes in handy when you want to apply different effects to a scene divided into two frames. For example, you might want to divide a scene to show a fall into a character’s monologue, or into the past. The left-hand side panel in <em class="italic">Figure 5.31</em> is selected for editing. The <strong class="screenText">Divide by straight line</strong> option in <strong class="screenText">Shape of division</strong> was used to split the the frames.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_05_31.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.31: Panel divided into two</p>
<p class="normal"><em class="italic">Figure </em><em class="italic"><a id="_idIndexMarker406"/></em><em class="italic">5.32</em> shows the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette<a id="_idIndexMarker407"/> for the <strong class="screenText">Divide frame border</strong> tool. Refer to the preceding list for a breakdown of each of these options. This tool divides an existing frame but keeps each new frame on the same layer, making connected<a id="_idIndexMarker408"/> panels.<img alt="" src="img/B22275_05_32.png"/></p>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.32: Tool property for the Divide frame border tool</p>
<p class="normal">In <em class="italic">Figure 5.33</em>, the panel has been split using the <strong class="screenText">Divide by spline</strong> setting, in order to make a curved division. </p>

<p class="normal">Now we know<a id="_idIndexMarker409"/> how to create, edit, and divide <a id="_idIndexMarker410"/>panels. We can also use panel templates to help save time with page creation. Keep reading to find out how!</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-111">Using framing template materials</h2>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> <a id="_idIndexMarker411"/>palette has tons of useful resources that can save lots of time when working on your creative projects. Included in the <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> palette are a large number of framing templates that can be used to easily and quickly set up a comic page.</p>
<p class="normal">You will find out more about the <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> palette in <em class="italic">Chapter 09</em>, <em class="italic">Inking Special Effects and the Material Palette.</em></p>
<p class="normal">The comic panel templates can be found in the <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> palette, under the <strong class="screenText">Manga material</strong> folder, and in the <strong class="screenText">Framing template</strong> sub-folder. This folder is shown in <em class="italic"><a id="_idIndexMarker412"/></em><em class="italic">Figure 5.34</em>.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_05_34.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.34: Material palette</p>
<p class="normal">The icons on the right-hand side of the <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> palette show a preview of the layout of the comic panels. To add one of these to your page, locate the desired framing template and click to select it. The selection will be highlighted in blue. To add the material to your page, click on the <strong class="screenText">Paste selected material to canvas</strong> icon at the bottom of the <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> palette, which looks like the following screenshot:</p>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 5.35: Paste selected material to canvas icon</p>
<p class="normal">The left-hand <a id="_idIndexMarker413"/>side of the following screenshot shows the <strong class="screenText">4 frames 2 strips with titles</strong> framing template added to canvas, and the right-hand side shows that each panel in the template is in its own empty folder in the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette. By using the framing<a id="_idIndexMarker414"/> templates, we can also concentrate more on the art of drawing our comics!</p>

<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Want to save some time by using a framing template but each of your comic pages has a different panel layout? Create a framing template with one large panel around the inner border of the page and apply it to the story file. Then, use the <strong class="keyWord">Divide Frame Folder</strong> or <strong class="keyWord">Divide Frame Border</strong> tool to slice one large panel into smaller panels!</p>

<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-112">Summary</h1>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we covered all manner of ground regarding manga creations! First, we learned how to set up workspaces, then about creating new files and templates, and finally, all about frame border panels!</p>
<p class="normal">You may come back to this chapter for more adjustment of your workspace as you find easier workspace layouts, and to try out new file settings or panel layouts for more complex storytelling.</p>
<p class="normal">For file configurations, I personally recommend you stick to the new file template settings we used in the example in the <em class="italic">Adding templates to a new file</em> section, unless you are required to create your manga in specific settings. In that way, you don’t need to worry about what settings you should configure each time you create a new file; it’s great to jump into creation quickly! Just ensure to keep the file resolution around 300 dpi.</p>
<p class="normal">Now you have a great manga workspace to draw your stories onto and panel variations, shall we move on to exploring erasers? In the next chapter, we will learn about erasers, selection tools, Sub view palette, and how we can use them. Let’s read on!</p>
