- en: Welcome to *Instant HTML5 Geolocation How-to*. This guide will help you make
    any web application aware of a user's location, quickly and easily. You will learn
    how to map a user's geographic location, integrate with popular mapping platforms,
    and track the user over time. In the process, you will create a simple application
    that generates a KML file containing both a path and points that you choose to
    save along that path (which can then be imported into Google Maps).

- en: The iPhone changed the way we use the web. It was the first mobile device that
    included web browsing as a primary function. Suddenly, with mobile data and a
    phone like the iPhone, the web could be in your pocket, wherever you went. Through
    HTML5 and APIs, web applications could be truly context sensitive; they could
    know where you were, if you wanted them to, and react accordingly.

- en: The Geolocation API is not part of HTML5, and is, instead, a JavaScript API
    standard. However, it sits alongside the evolving HTML5 specification as an important
    part of any modern web development toolkit.

    how to create the KML feed from coordinates you have saved in previous sections,
    and test it by importing it into Google Maps. KML feeds are supported by popular

- en: '*Tracking and updating the user''s location (Intermidiate)* illustrates how
    to track the user and show his/her path, using simple web technologies. Sometimes,
    tracking the user''s movements is important. Here we will use `watchPosition()`
    and `clearPosition()` to track the user''s location over time, and change the
    maps that were created in the previous section.'

- en: '*Instant HTML5 Geolocation How-to* is for web developers who want to incorporate
    Geolocation technology into their applications. There is no need to know anything
    about Geolocation software or standards; each section has been designed to help
    you understand how the API works from beginning to end. However, this book assumes
    a general understanding of web technologies, and both JavaScript and jQuery in
    particular.'
