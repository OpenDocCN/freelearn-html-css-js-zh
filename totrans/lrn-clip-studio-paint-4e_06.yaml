    from start to finish, a certain amount of refinement is needed in most art processes.
    We will use a variety of tools in this chapter to refine our images, from erasers
    to selection tools that allow us to scale and rotate sections of our image. We
    will also learn about a great feature of Clip Studio Paint, the **Sub View** palette,
    which allows us to store and use reference images easily.

    Especially when we are creating very neat and slick styles of art, eraser tools
    and transparent color become our guardians. They are not only for erasing unnecessary
    marks; we can also use them tactically, such as for brightness, light reflections,
    cut-out frames, disappearing objects, and rainy scenes. Read on to find out more.

    accessed by clicking on the **Eraser** icon in the toolbar and then choosing an
    option from the **Sub Tool** palette. Each of these **Eraser** sub tools has a
    different use. But, by using the transparent color selection in the Color Picker
    option in the toolbar, we can also transform any mark-making tool into an eraser.
    We will touch on transparent colors in more detail in the *Using transparent color*

    draw, undo, draw, undo… until I create the desired line. I find I always get the

    (bilinear)** setting blends colors of adjacent pixels and smooths them, but this
    may lead to a blurry outline, depending on the content being transformed. **Hard
    edges (nearest neighbor)** maintains a sharp color separation by not blending
    based on adjacent pixels; however, this may lead to unwanted rough edges. **Clear
    edges (bicubic)** blends and smooths the color separations for a smooth transition,
    and when the image is rotated, the outline is processed so that it is more emphasized
    than the **Smooth** option. White noise may occur around the outline, however.
    **High accuracy (average colors)** calculates the average color of each pixel
    contained in an image after transformation. The image becomes clear when it’s
    enlarged, and softer when it’s shrunk. A thin line will not be interrupted when
    it’s shrunk. However, the edges of the shrunk image can be blurred, and you may
    need to go back and forward with other options to get your desired result on an
    image that contains a lot of thin lines.'

    flip, and select colors from those images. If you are a comic book artist, this
    palette can be used to hold character designs, concept art, background design
    sketches, color swatches, and any other images you may need access to on a regular
    basis while making comics. For illustrators, this can be used to hold reference
    images or other inspiration. It’s a little reference library that remembers the
    images loaded into it so that you don’t have to go through the process of opening
    them in new windows every time you open Clip Studio Paint.

    Paint solves a common digital art problem. Those of you reading this book who
    have done digital art in the past might be familiar with the following scenario.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You finalize your sketch and create a layer for your final inks. You ink for
    a bit and then realize that something in the sketch needs to be changed. You switch
    back to the sketch layer and make the correction, then continue inking. It isn’t
    until you finish inking that you realize you never switched back to your ink layer,
    and now you have your inks on the same layer as the pencil sketch and must start
    over.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is an extremely frustrating and common problem when working with digital
    layers. Thankfully, the makers of Clip Studio Paint have given us a feature that
    makes this a thing of the past. Sure, you could prevent this by locking the sketch
    layer so that no changes can be made to it at all, but then if a change needs
    to be made, you have to spend the time unlocking it before you can correct an
    error or adjust a detail. This seems minor, but locking and unlocking a layer
    takes precious time, and I am all about streamlining the workflow as much as possible!
