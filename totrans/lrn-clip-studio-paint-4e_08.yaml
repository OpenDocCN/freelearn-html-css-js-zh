- en: Back in the early days of comics, pencil lines were too light to be picked up
    by the cameras used to replicate comic art. So, artists used a brush or pen and
    black ink to redraw over the pencil lines and make them dark enough for the cameras
    to pick up. Inking has become an art in and of itself. Clip Studio Paint has some
    of the best inking tools in the digital art world, packaged with it when you purchase
    the software. There are also a multitude of third-party tools available either
    for free or to purchase that provide specialty inking functionalities that give
    different looks and feels to inked lines.

- en: Inking in the world of non-digital tools is the process of using pens or brushes
    and black India ink to finalize pencil lines and make them ready for toning or
    coloring. The printing presses back in the early days of comics weren’t capable
    of printing grayscale, so dark black ink lines were needed to reproduce the comic
    art.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the digital world, we aren’t restricted to simply black ink for our lines,
    and we have a multitude of tools we can use to make our finalized lines. There
    is an art to good inking that we should discuss briefly.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Inking is the art of taking a rough pencil sketch and providing finalized edges,
    volume, and a sense of light and shadow. To see this process in action, let’s
    take a look at an inking from a sketch to final shades and examine how the inked
    lines accentuate the mood of the piece.

    about in *Chapter 3*, *Penciling: Layer and Later Property Palettes*. In that
    chapter, we touched on how to use the pencil sketch to establish characters’ proportions.
    Before we start inking, let’s touch on that method again while introducing some
    more complexity – this time looking at **perspective**.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you compose a visual, you should think about how perspective performs wonders
    when you want to create dynamism in a still image. Once you’re comfortable with
    proportions, delving into perspective is the natural next skill to learn to create
    great pencil sketches.
  prefs: []

    in art. We know that objects closer to you look bigger than objects far away.
    In the image to the left, we can see I drew my 7-heads proportion characters in
    one frame with perspective on the right, which created a more dramatic look than
    just lining them up without overlapping or perspective.

    his body hidden by the other two characters.

    them individually to edit the composition. For example, you could select each
    individual character and move them around the composition, resizing them as you
    go. You can edit or re-sketch till you feel it looks right.

    could be a long and rewarding journey for you. Really, it is a never-ending experience.

    training yourself to draw expressions will produce much livelier artwork!

    eyes. If you’re new to drawing expressions, this is worth thinking about and practicing
    – how does a character frown with their eyes? How do they smile with their eyes?
    Try drafting different expressions on top of each other using different layers.
    Notice how much difference the position of their eyebrows makes. Additionally,
    you’ll want to think about blushes, wincing marks around the eyes, and other details.

    Now that you have used pencil sketches to work on your art to the point that you’re

    the new inking lines more easily.

    very fine lines over content, as well as detailing.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    with thicker **G-pen** lines to make the characters stand out from the background,
    and details are added with thinner mapping pen lines. If all the lines were of
    the same thickness, readers of the manga would have trouble finding where to focus.
    For an extreme perspective scene, you can use very thick lines for the closest
    object!

    look under the characters’ faces, and under the flower crown, noticing how the

    dark hair by adding some lines to create a closed section with any pen tool, filling
    the sections with the **Fill** tool on the layer below, and leaving a small section
    untouched for a shiny hair effect.

    image was drawn in thinner lines with a mapping pen compared to the character
    outlines, because the nature in the background is further away from the camera

    background layer to light gray. This helps create more contrast with the objects

    as a final inking tool is the “handmade” feeling it gives. Not only is it light
    and easy to draw with, but it also gives a warm, hand-drawn impression, just like
    looking at an artist’s sketchbook. The screenshot on the right shows a panel drawn

    whole manga, except where you want to add a different impression to particular
    parts of the story, such as episodes from someone’s past or a dream sequence.
    For instance, if you started using the **G-pen** in 12 pt, keep using it until
    the end. Otherwise, the visuals of the manga will not hold consistency, and readers
    will not be able to concentrate on the story anymore.

    experience more like working on paper or a spring-loaded nib that gives the squishy
    feel of a brush or nib. So, if you have one of these tablets with a nib that can
    be changed, be sure to experiment with it! Also, you’ll want to make sure you
    have a few extra nibs on hand, because nibs can and will wear out over time and

    it’s different from inking on raster layers as we have been learning, but believe
    me, it’s equally useful. Let’s find out more!
  prefs: []

- en: Inking on vector layers
  prefs:

- en: For a beginner inker, inking on a vector layer is very forgiving because of
    the editable nature of vector lines. (For more information on vector lines, see
    *Chapter 10*, *Exploring* *Vector Layers.*) If you are just starting out with
    inking, or if you want to be able to draw an inked line once and then tweak it
    until it’s perfect, inking on a vector layer is going to be perfect for your needs!
    However, beginner inkers, remember that in the digital realm, even ink can be
    erased, and the **Undo** button will forgive most sins. So long as you remember
    to begin inking on a layer separate from your sketch, you will be able to erase
    and tweak your lines regardless of whether you go with raster or vector inks.

- en: For an example of how we can tweak ink lines on vector layers, let’s take a
    look at the screenshot on the right, showing lines we made with the **Pen** tool
    and that hasn’t had any vector adjustments made yet.

    preferences. The more you practice with inking, the better you will become! In
    the next section, we will look at some tips on how to ink comic panels effectively.

    Clip Studio Paint, let’s talk about inking a comic page. These are general tips,
    of course, because we could write an entire book just about inking comics (and
    entire books have, in fact, been written about this!). But for those just starting
    out, here are some general tips that make the inking process a little easier:'

- en: Start with the panels that you’re most excited about inking. In traditional
    inking, we would start from the opposite corner of our dominant hand and ink diagonally
    across the page and down to avoid smearing drying ink, but with digital inks,
    we don’t have to worry about that. Start with whatever panels you wish to ink
    first and move around the page as you like.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Remember to turn on the **Layer Color** option on any pencil layers before beginning
    to ink. This ensures that we can easily see where we’ve inked already and any
    lines we may have missed and keeps us from inking on the wrong layer and having
    to start all over again.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ink on separate layers for characters and backgrounds, or the foreground and
    background. I like to separate my characters from the backgrounds and then apply
    layer masks as needed. This not only allows me to adjust the position of characters
    or background elements more easily, but also ensures that backgrounds can be reused
    in other panels if needed.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Use the eraser tools or the transparent color to correct your mistakes. Remember
    that digital ink isn’t permanent! We can adjust it, delete the ink layer, and
    start over, or add textures using erasers or tools set to the **transparency**
    option.

- en: If you really want to improve your inking, there are hundreds of resources on
    the internet where artists post their penciled work for others to ink and/or color.
    Make sure that you have the permission of the original artist to use this work,
    and that you give credit and a link to the artist’s website if you post your inked
    version somewhere! Practice is the best way to improve and to find your own style.
