                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Creating a Home Screen Experience with a Web Manifest</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">Progressive web apps make a website feel like a native app. For a business stakeholder, this gives them the opportunity to use a free app store to engage customers. For real users, it means that the sites they routinely visit can be installed without any friction. Either way, it is a marketing opportunity to increase engagement by delivering a better user experience and an natural way to place their brand's icon in the customer's most important location: their homescreen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Each platform (operating system and browser) implements a homescreen and how the application is launched in their own way, but most involve some sort of bookmarking process and opening experience driven by the web manifest file.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Chrome for Android places installed PWAs in the application shelf and allows PWAs to be managed like a native app in the device settings. Microsoft leverages the Windows Store and is formulating a free store installation process for future releases. Apple is still figuring out how they will implement these experiences, but they are building on their legacy experiences.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This chapter goes over how to create a web manifest file to describe your application to the platform and how you can programmatically prompt the user to add a PWA to their homescreen. You'll see me refer to the process of add to homescreen throughout this chapter, but it is only a name that refers to more. The term add to homescreen has sort of grown to be the de facto way of describing how PWAs are installed on the user's device.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The reality is more diverse as there is no official common specification for this process. On Android, you add application icons to the homescreen, and since this is where PWAs first saw adoption, this is how the term originated. Today, each browser and platform handles this process differently. Even unique browsers on Android vary from what Chrome has been practicing. During the writing of this chapter, Microsoft Edge required you go through the Windows Store to install progressive web apps, but even that is in flux.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As this chapter progresses, you will see how this concept applies to different browsers and platforms, and learn how to describe your PWA to the platforms using a web manifest file.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>
<ul class="calibre10">
<li class="calibre11">The web manifest file</li>
<li class="calibre11">How the add to homescreen process works</li>
<li class="calibre11">How to use legacy features to <em class="calibre23">Polyfil</em> the add to homescreen experience</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Why add to homescreen is important</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">Reengagement is a key advantage that native applications have enjoyed over websites. The presence of their icon on the user's homescreen and app shelves provides quick, visual access to the brand's experience. It's subtle, but that icon is a constant visual reminder of the customer's relationship to the brand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Browsers have provided a built-in mechanism for us to bookmark websites using favorites for years now, but these lists have become cluttered messes we often forget about. We have also been able to add bookmarks to the desktop, start menu, and even the windows task bar, but the process is manual, and most consumers do not know that it exists.</p>
<p class="calibre2">More modern browsers have started logging pages that you frequently visit and providing bookmarks to these common destinations when you open a new tab. This is an example of making the user more productive without asking them to <em class="calibre13">bookmark</em> a URL.</p>
<p class="calibre2">These bookmarks do not offer the same native experience that the progressive web app's add to homescreen experience does. Chrome on Android is leading the way with the most advanced PWA installation benefits by making all installed PWAs a WebAPK.</p>
<p class="calibre2">WebAPKs are a technical way to say that Chrome on Android will silently upgrade progressive web apps to an almost native app by packaging them as an APK (Android executable) during the installation process. They are still limited because they do not have access to Android-specific APIs like native Android apps do.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, if you submit your PWA to the Windows Store and the customer installs it from the Windows Store, your progressive web app is a native app. It will enjoy all the benefits and capabilities as native apps do on Windows, including file system access and the ability to integrate with features like Cortana.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The ability to earn a place on a customer's home screen is important. Both native and web applications have mechanisms, but both have friction that reduces success and increase costs. There are 6-8 steps which you must use to coax a potential customer to install your app on mobile platforms. In 2012, <em class="calibre13">Gabor Cselle</em> estimated that each of these steps eliminates 20% of the mobile user's interested in installing your app (<a href="https://blog.gaborcselle.com/2012/10/every-step-costs-you-20-of-users.html" class="calibre9">https://blog.gaborcselle.com/2012/10/every-step-costs-you-20-of-users.html</a>). This means for a 6-step installation process that only 26% of users remain, as illustrated in the following diagram. That number falls to less than 17% if there are 8 steps:</p>
<div><div><img src="img/00011.gif" class="calibre24"/></div>
</div>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, a user only starts the app installation process if they know how to/can find you in the app store. This means that your company must invest time and money driving traffic and brand awareness. Recent research reveals that this would cost between $8-14 on iOS and slightly less on Android.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yet, for a few pennies paid per click, Facebook, <strong class="calibre4">pay-per-click</strong> (<strong class="calibre4">PPC</strong>), or banner ad campaigns can drive the same engagement to a website. Even better, if your page has a good, organic SEO profile, you can drive volumes of targeted traffic for free! However, earning a place on the customer's homescreen is not as easy. That's because it is not an obvious process.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rewinding to the original iPhone launch, third-party apps were not available till 6 months later. At WWDC, Steve Jobs announced the third-party app solution HTML5 + AJAX (<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2007/06/11iPhone-to-Support-Third-Party-Web-2-0-Applications/" class="calibre9">https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2007/06/11iPhone-to-Support-Third-Party-Web-2-0-Applications/</a>):</p>
<div><em class="calibre23">"Developers can create Web 2.0 applications which look and behave just like the applications built into iPhone, and which can seamlessly access iPhone's services, including making a phone call, sending an email, and displaying a location in Google Maps. Third-party applications created using Web 2.0 standards can extend iPhone's capabilities without compromising its reliability or security."</em></div>
<p class="calibre2">With that proclamation, Apple provided a simple, and sort of hacky, way to drive the homescreen experience on iOS. The non-standard techniques required adding iOS Safari specific META tags to each page and having appropriate sized homescreen images.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Making your PWA iOS web app capable</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">When Apple introduced iOS, the original app recommendation was to use HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to create rich client-side user experiences. Apple has not removed web app support and has enhanced some capabilities over time. The iOS web app experience is driven by custom metadata that's added to a web page's <kbd class="calibre12">HEAD</kbd>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Much of the Apple meta data has served as a model for the modern web manifest specification. Before the web manifest specification was created, Chrome on Android integrated support for the Apple meta data to drive a similar experience.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The web app experience on iOS is triggered when your website contains Apple-specific META tags, corresponding icons, and when the user has added your site to their homescreen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The first piece you need is a png file as the default homescreen icon. The file should be named <kbd class="calibre12">apple-touch-icon.png</kbd> and it should be present in your site's root folder.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Individual pages can have a unique icon with a <kbd class="calibre12">link</kbd> reference in the <kbd class="calibre12">HEAD</kbd>:</p>
<pre class="calibre17">&lt;link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/custom_icon.png"&gt; </pre>
<p class="calibre2">It is even better to specify icons for different screen sizes and densities. The platform will determine which icon works best for the device. If no icon is specified, the root folder is searched for icons with the <kbd class="calibre12">apple-touch-icon</kbd> prefix:</p>
<pre class="calibre17">&lt;link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="touch-icon-iphone.png"&gt; 
&lt;link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="152x152" href="touch-icon-ipad.png"&gt; 
&lt;link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="touch-icon-iphone-retina.png"&gt; 
&lt;link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="167x167" href="touch-icon-ipad-retina.png"&gt; </pre>
<p class="calibre2">When the required meta data is supplied, you must then coax the user to initiate the iOS add to homescreen process. This starts when they press Safari's share icon:</p>
<div><img src="img/00012.gif" class="calibre25"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">This triggers the Safari share menu, which contains more than just options to share the URL: it contains icons to bookmarks and saves the site to the home screen, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/00013.jpeg" class="calibre26"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">Similar to the home screen icon, the Launch screen image can be specified. Think of this as a splash screen. This is done with a LINK element and a reference to the startup image. If no image is specified, a screenshot of the last time the app was launched is used:</p>
<pre class="calibre17">&lt;link rel="apple-touch-startup-image" href="/ meta/apple-touch-startup-image-640x920.png"&gt; </pre>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">The application title is set with another META tag</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">This is similar to the name and short name manifest properties I'll discuss in detail in the the <em class="calibre13">web manifest</em> section. If no META value is supplied, the <kbd class="calibre12">title</kbd> element value is used:</p>
<pre class="calibre17">&lt;meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-title" content="2048 PWA"&gt; </pre>
<p class="calibre2">Check the output in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/00014.jpeg" class="calibre27"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">Next, you should control how your web app appears to the user. iOS allows you to either launch the app in the browser or as a standalone mode. Standalone mode removes the browser, but retains the iOS status bar across the top of the screen. Check the following code for this:</p>
<pre class="calibre17">  &lt;meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes"&gt; 
  &lt;meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" content="black"&gt; </pre>
<p class="calibre2">When in standalone mode, there is no address bar, so you may need to adjust your UI to allow customers to copy URLs and go back to previous screens. The navigation concerns are the same that native application designers negotiate, and every application has different requirements.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The status bar can also be styled with the <kbd class="calibre12">apple-mobile-web-app-bar-style</kbd> value. This value is only used when your app is launched in standalone mode. You can change the default grey to either black or translucent black.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unfortunately, you cannot theme the color to match your application theme or hide it altogether:</p>
<div><img src="img/00015.jpeg" class="calibre28"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">If you have done everything according to Apple's specifications, when a user launches the 2048 game, it should consume the entire screen, as demonstrated in the preceding screenshot.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Apple may have paved the way for a more intimate relationship with web brands on iOS, but their approach was never a common standard. This has changed in the era of progressive web apps as the W3C standardized, which is a meta data format to describe your web app to the platform.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">The web manifest specification</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">The Web Manifest describes the progressive web applications with meta data and JSON formatting. Browsers parse the manifest file to create the add to homescreen icon and launch the experiences.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now, instead of polluting each page's <kbd class="calibre12">HEAD</kbd> with extra meta data, the browser can load an external file containing standard properties and values formatted using JSON.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The web manifest specification (<a href="https://w3c.github.io/manifest/" target="_blank" class="calibre9">https://w3c.github.io/manifest/</a>) provides some guidelines for browsers to establish an add to homescreen experience. How browsers implement the experience is left open ended, making an avenue for creativeness. I will cover this topic in more detail after reviewing the manifest file.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Referencing the web manifest file</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">The web manifest file must be referenced in the document's HEAD, as mentioned in the following code:</p>
<pre class="calibre17">&lt;head&gt; 
   .... 
  &lt;link rel="manifest" href="manifest.json"&gt; 
&lt;/head&gt; </pre>
<p class="calibre2">Manifests should be served using the <kbd class="calibre12">application/manifest+json</kbd> MIME type. This is an important setting because it is often overlooked.</p>
<p>You should research how to define or add MIME types in your web server of choice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Many servers block requests to files based on their type by default. This often leads to manifest files returning 404 or 403 type status codes. I see similar issues raised when PDF documents need to be served. You may need to coordinate with your network administrators or devops team to make sure that your servers are properly configured.</p>
<p>Do not cache the web manifest file using your service worker. You may not be able to update the file without updating your service worker. They should remain decoupled.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Web manifest properties</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">Owning your application's appearance is vital to ensuring the best user experience. Every application has unique use cases, eliminating the idea that one size fits all for progressive web applications. While most applications will want to copy a native application full screen experience, some will want to maintain a visible address bar. A standardized manifest file provides brand owners a communication channel with the browser to deliver the best branded experience.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The manifest should contain a series of properties, including <kbd class="calibre12">name</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre12">short_name</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre12">description</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre12">icons</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre12">orientation</kbd>, colors, and a default page. These are used for the homescreen and launch experience.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A minimal list of manifest properties is as follows:</p>
<ul class="calibre10">
<li class="calibre11"><kbd class="calibre12">name</kbd></li>
<li class="calibre11"><kbd class="calibre12">short_name</kbd></li>
<li class="calibre11"><kbd class="calibre12">description</kbd></li>
<li class="calibre11"><kbd class="calibre12">icons</kbd></li>
<li class="calibre11"><kbd class="calibre12">orientation</kbd></li>
<li class="calibre11"><kbd class="calibre12">theme_color</kbd></li>
<li class="calibre11"><kbd class="calibre12">background_color</kbd></li>
<li class="calibre11"><kbd class="calibre12">start_url</kbd></li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre2">There are additional official properties which you can specify within the manifest, but their use cases are limited. I would also point out that because the document uses JSON, a mutable data structure notation, it is extensible, and some browsers are experimenting with proprietary properties. Don't worry if you are using a non-standard property – you won't break other browsers because they just ignore those values.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are two name properties; <kbd class="calibre12">name</kbd> and <kbd class="calibre12">short_name</kbd>. The <kbd class="calibre12">short_name</kbd> is used with the homescreen icon and other places where spaced is constrained. Where space allows, the <kbd class="calibre12">name</kbd> property is used.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is what the first four properties look like in the 2048 app:</p>
<pre class="calibre17">{ 
  "name": "2048", 
  "short_name": "2048", 
  "description": "[provide your description here]", 
   "start_url": "/", 
... 
} </pre>
<p class="calibre2">The <kbd class="calibre12">start_url</kbd> defines the initial URL that's loaded when the homescreen icon is selected. This eliminates the scenario where the user adds the PWA to the homescreen from a deep link, like a news article. In the past, the icon would be a bookmark to that article, not the home page.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The <kbd class="calibre12">start_url</kbd> can be any URL within the application's scope. It does not need to be the public home page; it can be a special PWA home page. You can also use QueryString values to drive additional tracking and dynamic behavior from the server.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next, the <kbd class="calibre12">icons</kbd> property is an array of <kbd class="calibre12">icon</kbd> objects defining the URL to an icon, the MIME type, and dimensions:</p>
<pre class="calibre17">"icons": [ 
    {     
      "src": "meta/2048-logo-70x70.png", 
      "sizes": "70x70", 
      "type": "image/png" 
    }, 
... 
    { 
      "src": "meta/2048-logo-600x310.png", 
      "sizes": "600x310", 
      "type": "image/png" 
    } 
  ], </pre>
<p class="calibre2">While different image types are supported, I recommend using .png as Chrome is looking for at least one <kbd class="calibre12">.png</kbd> of 144 x 144 dimensions. You should include at least four icons, one being at least 144 x 144, but 192 x 192 is better. In <a target="_blank" href="part0222.html#6JMSS0-f12cdcca08b54960b3d271452dc7667d" class="calibre9">Chapter 10</a>, <em class="calibre13">Service Worker Tools</em>, I'll show you how to use <a href="https://www.pwabuilder.com/" target="_blank" class="calibre9">https://www.pwabuilder.com/</a> to help you automate the process of creating a full set of images.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My rule of thumb is to include a dozen or more icon variations to account for differences in potential platform requirements and opportunities. Windows Live Tiles can be 600 pixels wide and can be scaled down to less than 70 pixels wide.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is also a good idea to use some art direction when creating icons. Some logos do not work well in smaller situations. If you add your icon to the homescreen and find it difficult to locate, chances are your customers will too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A splash screen image is drawn from the icons array. Chrome chooses the image that is closest to 128dp for the device. The title is simply pulled from the name member. Specify the background color using the appropriately named <kbd class="calibre12">background_color</kbd> property.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The following image shows how the Flipkart.com site's colors and logo icon are used to create a brief splash as the web app is loaded:</p>
<div><img src="img/00016.jpeg" class="calibre29"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">Reference your PWAs icons as URLs using an array. Each item in the array is an object that describes the icon. Include the src URL, the sizes property, and MIME type. I recommend using .png files since Chrome currently requires this format.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Controlling the launch style</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">The manifest has properties which are used by the platform to know how to launch the application. The <kbd class="calibre12">display</kbd> property allows you to control how the Chrome browser is rendered. The default value is <kbd class="calibre12">browser</kbd>, which launches the PWA in a browser, with Chrome.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The <kbd class="calibre12">minimal-ui</kbd> option launches the PWA as an application, but with a minimal set of navigation UI.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><kbd class="calibre12">standalone</kbd> launches the PWA as a full screen application. The application takes up most of the screen, but some browser elements, like the status bar, may be rendered. Check the following code to understand the properties:</p>
<pre class="calibre17">  "display": "fullscreen", 
  "orientation": "landscape", </pre>
<p class="calibre2"><kbd class="calibre12">fullscreen</kbd> mode launches the application in full screen and application mode without any browser elements. To the end user, it feels like they have opened a native app.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The values currently supported for the display are as follows:</p>
<ul class="calibre10">
<li class="calibre11"><kbd class="calibre12">fullscreen</kbd>: Launches the application in full screen.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><kbd class="calibre12">standalone</kbd>: Similar to fullscreen, but may have a system UI visible.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><kbd class="calibre12">minimal-ui</kbd>: Adds some minimal browser navigation UI components to the standalone view.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><kbd class="calibre12">browser</kbd>: Opens the PWA as a regular web page in the browser.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><kbd class="calibre12">orientation</kbd>: This property defines what angle the application renders. The primary choices are landscape and portrait. The values should be self-explanatory. No, you cannot render your app at a 45 degree tilt!</li>
<li class="calibre11">The full set of orientation options are as follows:
<ul class="calibre30">
<li class="calibre11"><kbd class="calibre12">any</kbd></li>
<li class="calibre11"><kbd class="calibre12">natural</kbd></li>
<li class="calibre11"><kbd class="calibre12"><kbd class="calibre31">landscape</kbd></kbd></li>
<li class="calibre11"><kbd class="calibre12"><kbd class="calibre31">portrait</kbd></kbd></li>
<li class="calibre11"><kbd class="calibre12">portrait-primary</kbd></li>
<li class="calibre11"><kbd class="calibre12">portrait-secondary</kbd></li>
<li class="calibre11"><kbd class="calibre12">landscape-primary</kbd></li>
<li class="calibre11"><kbd class="calibre12">landscape-secondary</kbd></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre2">The <kbd class="calibre12">theme_color</kbd> and <kbd class="calibre12">background_color</kbd> are used to represent the app and provide the default background color. The difference between these two colors is in how they are applied:</p>
<pre class="calibre17">  "background_color": "#fff", 
  "theme_color": "#f67c5f", </pre>
<p class="calibre2">The background color refers the default background color of the <kbd class="calibre12">BODY</kbd> elements. This is typically set in the site's CSS. If not, it defaults back to the browser's default. Today, the de facto background color is white, but in the early days, it was grey.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The <kbd class="calibre12">theme_color</kbd> defines what color the operating system uses to visualize the application. This includes the task switching experience. Each platform offers different user experiences related to how apps are presented, so application of the theme color will vary.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If your application uses a language that is right to left, you can specify that using the <kbd class="calibre12">dir</kbd> property. The direction is then applied to the <kbd class="calibre12">name</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre12">short_name</kbd>, and <kbd class="calibre12">description</kbd> fields.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The <kbd class="calibre12">lang</kbd> property relates to <kbd class="calibre12">dir</kbd> because it designates what language the site uses. It is also applied to the text properties. The value should be a standard language tag (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang" class="calibre9">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang</a>) consisting of a 2 or 3 character code followed by an optional subtag, for example, <kbd class="calibre12">en-US</kbd> or <kbd class="calibre12">en-GB</kbd>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If you happen to have a native app available that provides functionality not available in your PWA, you can indicate its availability using the <kbd class="calibre12">prefer_related_applications</kbd> field and setting it as either true or false. Use this in conjunction with the <kbd class="calibre12">related_applications</kbd> value to hint at how to install the native app:</p>
<pre class="calibre17">"related_applications": [

  }] </pre>
<p class="calibre2">Chrome recently added support for the manifest scope property, adding more control over how a PWA and the pages it links to are rendered. I will review how Chrome specifically uses this property within the concept of the WebAPK or <em class="calibre13">improved add to homescreen experience</em> section later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The <kbd class="calibre12">scope</kbd> property defines the web application's context or range of URLs that are considered to be part of the progressive web application. Platforms can use this as they see fit, but the consensus is that if the user navigates within the scope, the browser will render PWA according to the manifest's <kbd class="calibre12">display</kbd> property. Any navigation outside of this scope results in the page being rendered with the full Chrome browser.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Apple Safari web manifest support</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">Since Apple released the iOS 11.3 and Safari 13 updates, basic support for the web manifest specification was included. There are some limitations to the current usage and support of the web manifest:</p>
<ul class="calibre10">
<li class="calibre11">The home screen icon is still referenced from the <kbd class="calibre12">apple-touch-icon</kbd></li>
<li class="calibre11">Transparent icons are not supported</li>
<li class="calibre11">No 3D touch menu support</li>
<li class="calibre11">No splash screen</li>
<li class="calibre11">Can't lock orientation</li>
<li class="calibre11">Display <kbd class="calibre12">fullscreen</kbd> and <kbd class="calibre12">minimal-ui</kbd> not supported properly</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre2">Apple still has work left so that they fully support using the web manifest, but it is a start. I believe that over the coming months we should see support being improved. One thing browser vendors struggle with is turning the ship to support modern ways of providing functionality.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Migrating from a 10-year-old way of providing user experience like touch icons and mobile web app capable features to a different mechanism is tough. If they do it too fast, they can and will break many sites, which is something all browser vendors fear. So, expect the transition to be gradual.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I would also like to point out that the PWA support, especially relating to service workers, is not yet supported in webviews used by many native apps. This also means that any hybrid applications will not have access to these features as a PWA, including the service worker.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Pseudo browsers like Chrome, Edge, and FireFox on iOS also do not support any progressive web app functionality on iOS. These browsers use the webview to render pages and not their own engines. So, for now, they are also limited.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The positive news is that Safari supports all major browsers on all major platforms, and nows support basic web manifest consumption.</p>

<p class="calibre2">The web manifest is a simple JSON document, but it's easy to make typos or forget things. If your site is not properly registering the manifest file, you will need to troubleshoot the issue. Fortunately, there are a few resources to help you validate your file.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Google hosts a simple online validator (<a href="https://manifest-validator.appspot.com" class="calibre9">https://manifest-validator.appspot.com</a>) where you can enter either a URL or just paste the manifest code into the page. It will parse your manifest and let you know if there is an issue:</p>
<div><img src="img/00017.jpeg" class="calibre32"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">The nodejs Web Manifest Validator (<a href="https://github.com/san650/web-app-manifest-validator" class="calibre9">https://github.com/san650/web-app-manifest-validator</a>) is a module you can include in your automated testing workflow to validate a manifest file. It is a couple of years old, so you may need to fork the project and update it if you are using newer manifest features. Remember that the manifest specification is not final and can and will change over time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">These are not the only tools. There are a few other node modules available as well as Lighthouse and Sonar. I will cover those tools in <a target="_blank" href="part0222.html#6JMSS0-f12cdcca08b54960b3d271452dc7667d" class="calibre9">Chapter 10</a>, <em class="calibre13">Service Worker Tools</em>, along with PWA Builder, which can generate your manifest.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">The Chrome improved add to homescreen experience</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">Some time in 2017, the Chrome team announced changes to the PWA installation experience called the improved add to homescreen experience. At the time, it was not as much about the automatic prompt, but that has been part of the change. It has more to do with how PWAs behave on Android and that it is more like a native application.</p>
<p class="calibre2">These changes were multifaceted and start with the web manifest scope property. This property is relatively new but allows the browser to know how to limit PWA functionality on an origin (domain name).</p>
<p class="calibre2">When you set the scope value to <kbd class="calibre12">/</kbd>, you are telling the platform that the progressive web application's capabilities apply to all paths within the origin. This may not always be the case, especially on larger sites and enterprise applications. Often, these sites are segmented into different applications.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If you changed the scope to say <kbd class="calibre12">/hr/</kbd>, then only URLs under the <kbd class="calibre12">/hr/</kbd> folder would be part of the PWA's scope. This means that those URLs will be opened according to the web manifest file configuration. URLs not within the <kbd class="calibre12">/hr/</kbd> folder will open normally in the browser.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When a PWA is installed using Chrome on Android, it automatically creates an unsigned WebAPK, which makes the PWA a native app. Within the WebAPK, an Android manifest is created, which includes intent filters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Intent filters tell Android how URLs within the origin should be opened. For PWAs, this means that the app is launched according to the manifest configuration or directly in the browser if outside of its scope.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Here is what these intent filters look like in the WebAPK:</p>
<pre class="calibre17">&lt;intent-filter&gt; 
  &lt;action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" /&gt; 
  &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" /&gt; 
  &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" /&gt; 
  &lt;data 
    android:scheme="https" 
    android:host="2048.love2dev.com" 
    android:pathPrefix="/" /&gt; 
&lt;/intent-filter&gt; </pre>
<p class="calibre2">The <kbd class="calibre12">pathPrefix</kbd> value changes to match the web manifest scope value:</p>
<pre class="calibre17">&lt;intent-filter&gt; 
  &lt;action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" /&gt; 
  &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" /&gt; 
  &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" /&gt; 
  &lt;data 
    android:scheme="https" 
    android:host="love2dev.com" 
    android:pathPrefix="/hr/" /&gt; 
&lt;/intent-filter&gt; </pre>
<p class="calibre2">These changes have not stopped with Android as recent updates have also been applied to Chrome OS and are in the near future for desktop Chrome. Google is in the process of replacing the Chrome OS apps with progressive web apps, giving similar capabilities to the previous web apps that are available on the platform.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Chrome is also bringing more of the add to homescreen experience to desktops as well. However, this will vary by operating system as there are different user expectations on each platform.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The good news is that if you make good progressive web applications, you will just benefit from these changes.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">The add to homescreen experience</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">The emergence of an automatic prompt to a visitor to add your progressive web app to their homescreen is exciting. In the past, Chrome would eventually display a prompt to install a progressive web app, but that has changed recently. The rules determining when the prompt triggers are still valid, but now only trigger the <kbd class="calibre12">beforeinstallprompt</kbd> event.</p>
<p class="calibre2">How the user prompt triggers is where each browser can choose a different path. Some of the requirements are defined in the web manifest specification, but the experience is left open ended for browsers to implement as they see fit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Right now, Chrome has the most mature process. They established the following criteria to automatically trigger the add to homescreen experience:</p>
<ul class="calibre10">
<li class="calibre11">Has a web app manifest file with:
<ul class="calibre30">
<li class="calibre11">A <kbd class="calibre12">short_name</kbd> (used on the homescreen)</li>
<li class="calibre11">A name (used in the banner)</li>
<li class="calibre11">A 144 x 144 .png icon (the icon declarations must include a mime type of image/png)</li>
<li class="calibre11"><kbd class="calibre12">Astart_url</kbd> that loads</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="calibre11">Has a service worker registered on your site:
<ul class="calibre30">
<li class="calibre11">Has a fetch event handler</li>
<li class="calibre11">The Fetch event handler cannot be a noop function, it must do something</li>
<li class="calibre11">Is served over HTTPS (a requirement for using service worker)</li>
<li class="calibre11">Is visited at least twice, with at least five minutes between visits</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="calibre11">FireFox, Samsung, and Opera have similar requirements. FireFox will trigger the experience on Android, but not the desktop. You can allow the experience on desktop, but it is hidden behind a flag.</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre2">These browsers typically provide a simple visual queue in the browser's address bar. Here is how FireFox on Android displays the indicator:</p>
<div><img src="img/00018.jpeg" class="calibre33"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">Notice how it uses a house with a <kbd class="calibre12">+</kbd> to indicate that the site can be installed. To its right, you will also see an Android logo silhouette. The little Android head indicates that an app is available. In this case, it is detecting the PWA I installed from Chrome, which created a WebAPK.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">The Chrome add to homescreen experience</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">The clear leader in the progressive web application experience is Chrome. They should be, since they created the concept. They have also had time to experiment with the concept to see what works, what doesn't, and what consumers and developers expect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This has led them to continually improve the process to the point that Chrome on Android creates a WebAPK when the app is installed, elevating the app to a similar level as native apps. Recently, they extended this functionality to Windows and ChromeOS, with plans to implement it on macOS soon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Here, you can see some recently installed progressive web apps in my Windows Start menu:</p>
<div><img src="img/00019.jpeg" class="calibre34"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">So, what exactly is a <strong class="calibre4">WebAPK</strong> and the <strong class="calibre4">enhanced add to homescreen experience</strong>?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have already explained this: it is where the Chrome packages progressive web apps in an apk package is called a <strong class="calibre4">WebAPK</strong>. If you are not familiar with Android native application development, all of the assets are packaged in a single file called an apk.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As an oversimplification, this is just a zip file containing the application's assets. Windows does something similar with the appx format. What Chrome does when it creates a WebAPK is akin to using Cordova to generate a native application from a website.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Chrome team instead decided to create a duplicate channel to maintain and give PWAs similar control, as native apps implementing this hybrid approach was most efficient. They first shipped this capability in Chrome 57. The big difference between a native Android application and an installed progressive web app is no access to platform APIs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The application appears like any Play Store installed application on the device. The icon can be placed on the homescreen, is visible in the app shelf, and can be managed through the Android platform settings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Here is how the 2048 PWA is surfaced in the Android application management interface:</p>
<div><img src="img/00020.jpeg" class="calibre35"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">As Chrome implements this functionality on other platforms, you may or may not find the same level of control. For example, you still can't manage a Chrome installed PWA from the control panel on Windows.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The application uses the same storage settings as the web page. Clearing storage for the domain will also clear the storage for the installed PWA. This means that cookies and cached content will be removed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Another benefit is when the web manifest file is updated to reference a new icon or change the name value. This will be updated on the homescreen icon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Google is not hoarding this functionality to themselves. They have provided documentation and reference for other user agents (browsers) to implement similar functionality (<a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/chrome/android/webapk" class="calibre9">https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/chrome/android/webapk</a>). This means that we could see FireFox, Samsung Internet, UC Browser, and so on implement similar functionality soon.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Your add to homescreen responsibilities</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">At Google I/O 2018, it was announced that Chrome on Android will no longer include an automated add to homescreen prompt. Instead, it is your responsibility to create the user experience. Ultimately, the Chrome team decided to fall more in line with how other browser vendors are crafting their experiences.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The manifest specification takes time to define skeleton rules and minimal requirements for the add to homescreen experience. Rather than limiting all browsers to the same rules, the specification defines <em class="calibre13">instalability signals</em> that can be used as part of the add to homescreen prompt algorithm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The prompt sequence should honor a modicum of privacy considerations and wait for the document to be fully loaded before issuing a prompt. The process should also allow the user to inspect the application name, icon, start URL, origin, and other properties. It is also recommended that the end user be allowed to modify some of the values. For example, changing the application name on their homescreen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is where the <kbd class="calibre12">beforeinstallprompt</kbd> event comes into play. This is your hook to a proper signal to prompt the user to install your progressive web app.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This event triggers when heuristics are met to trigger an add to homescreen experience. But instead of a native or built-in prompt from Chrome, you are responsible to prompt the user at an appropriate time after this event triggers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why did they change this? I am not 100% certain, though personally I thought it was a good idea to help promote web app installs. But this is somewhat intrusive and does not fall in line with other best practices. For example, when we look at enabling push notifications later in this book, you should not automatically pester the visitor to enable notifications.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There should be a little courtship before asking for the next level of engagement. I hate to use this analogy, but it has become canonical at this point; you can't just walk up to every pretty girl and ask them to marry you. It is a much longer process, where mutual trust must be earned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Asking a visitor to add your icon to their homescreen is not exactly the same as marriage, but is more like asking them to go steady or be exclusively dating.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To use the <kbd class="calibre12">beforeinstallprompt</kbd> event, add an event listener callback in your site's JavaScript:</p>
<pre class="calibre17">  var deferredPrompt; 
 
  window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', function (e) { 
 // Prevent Chrome 67 and earlier from automatically showing the prompt 
    e.preventDefault(); 
 // Stash the event so it can be triggered later. 
    deferredPrompt = e; 
 
    showAddToHomeScreen(); 
 
  }); </pre>
<p class="calibre2">There are a few moving parts I need to review. First is that the event object <kbd class="calibre12">(e)</kbd> has two unique properties, platforms, and <kbd class="calibre12">userChoice</kbd>. Platforms are arrays indicating if the user can install a native app or a progressive web app. The <kbd class="calibre12">userChoice</kbd> property resolves a promise indicating if the user chose to install the app or not.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The other piece used in this code is the <kbd class="calibre12">deferredPrompt</kbd> variable. This is declared outside the event handler, so it can be used at a later time, in this case within the <kbd class="calibre12">showAddToHomeScreen</kbd> logic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The <kbd class="calibre12">showAddToHomeScreen</kbd> method is called as soon as the event fires in this example, but a better practice is to defer the action to an appropriate time. Think about a user in the middle of an important application task. A sudden prompt to install the app would be a confusing distraction. It would serve you and the user better if you deferred the prompt till the action completes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The <kbd class="calibre12">showAddToHomeScreen</kbd> method displays a special overlay, asking the user to install the app:</p>
<pre class="calibre17">function showAddToHomeScreen() { 
 
  var a2hsBtn = document.querySelector(".ad2hs-prompt"); 
 
  a2hsBtn.style.display = "flex"; 
 
  a2hsBtn.addEventListener("click", addToHomeScreen); <br class="title-page-name"/>}</pre>
<p class="calibre2">I added a simple overlay to the 2048 application that slides up when made visible. Check out the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/00021.jpeg" class="calibre36"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">Once the prompt is accepted, the user is presented with the native add to homescreen prompt, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/00022.jpeg" class="calibre37"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">Finally, the <kbd class="calibre12">addToHomeScreen</kbd> method utilizes the <kbd class="calibre12">deferredPrompt</kbd> variable that we saved a reference to in the <kbd class="calibre12">beforeinstallprompt</kbd> event handler. It calls the prompt method, which displays the built-in dialog that's pictured in the preceding screenshot:</p>
<pre class="calibre17">  function addToHomeScreen() { 
 
... 
 
    if (deferredPrompt) { 
      // Show the prompt 
      deferredPrompt.prompt(); 
 
      // Wait for the user to respond to the prompt 
      deferredPrompt.userChoice 
        .then(function (choiceResult) { 
 
          if (choiceResult.outcome === 'accepted') { 
            console.log('User accepted the A2HS prompt'); 
          } else { 
            console.log('User dismissed the A2HS prompt'); 
          } 
 
          deferredPrompt = null; 
 
        }); 
    } 
  } </pre>
<p class="calibre2">The method then uses the <kbd class="calibre12">userChoice</kbd> method to perform tasks based on the choice. Here, I am just logging the choice to the console. You could persist a token indicating the state, or cascade additional logic to perform additional tasks.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think this is a good opportunity to initiate a thank you or onboarding experience.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The 2048 application is a very simple add to homescreen experience. You can expand this functionality to educate the user or tell them the benefits of adding your app to their homescreen. Flipkart has a neat educational sequence that explains how to install the app and why they should. It is a good experience to model and one of the reasons why they have been successful in using progressive web apps.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Disabling the homescreen prompt</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">The <kbd class="calibre12">beforeinstallprompt</kbd> event can also be used to suppress Chrome's automatic prompt. This time, like breaking the default form submission, call the <kbd class="calibre12">preventDefault</kbd> function and return false:</p>
<pre class="calibre17">window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', function(e) { 
  e.preventDefault(); 
  return false; 
}); </pre>
<p class="calibre2">This will block the behavior in Chrome. Right now, I don't know how to suppress the prompt on other platforms as they do not support the <kbd class="calibre12">beforeinstallprompt</kbd> event yet.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Tracking homescreen installs</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">Once the homescreen install prompt displays, the user can choose to add the PWA to their homescreen, or ignore the prompt. Businesses should track and measure everything possible to make better decisions. Knowing how many homescreen installs there have been and what rate customers install their PWA provides insight into their marketing and technology investments.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Chrome supports the <kbd class="calibre12">beforeinstallprompt</kbd> event, which can be used to track this activity. You can add a handler to this event and log each user's choice:</p>
<pre class="calibre17">window.addEventListener('beforeinstallprompt', function(event) { 
  event.userChoice.then(function(result) {                                  
 
if(result.outcome == 'dismissed') {                                         
  // They dismissed, send to analytics 
}else { 
  // User accepted! Send to analytics 
} 
});  
}); </pre>
<p class="calibre2">You can POST the user's choice to your analytics system. This could be a custom API to your internal analytics or even tied to your third-party service, like Google Analytics.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The <kbd class="calibre12">beforeinstallprompt</kbd> is part of the web manifest specification, but at the time of writing this book, it is only supported by Chrome. Hopefully, other browsers will add support soon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Browsers that don't support <kbd class="calibre12">beforeinstallprompt</kbd> can also provide feedback. The web manifest's <kbd class="calibre12">start_url</kbd> can be set either to a special start URL, or a custom querystring value appended to the default URL. You will need to add logic to your log analyzer to track this behavior. Besides just knowing how many homescreen installs you have, you can also track how many times users have launched your PWA as opposed to those who have not installed your PWA.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Polyfiling the homescreen experience on iOS and other legacy browsers</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">A common question developers and business owners ask is how to enable progressive web application features on iOS and older browsers like Internet Explorer. While all features cannot be hacked in these browsers, much of it can.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When the iPhone was released, the initial application model was the web. They created an advanced experience for web apps that included the add to homescreen experience. Unfortunately, they did not make an automatic prompt experience. Who knows how advanced this might be today if developers did not cry out for the native app model.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What we can do is still leverage this capability and use Matteo Spinelli's add to homescreen library (<a href="http://cubiq.org/add-to-home-screen" class="calibre9">http://cubiq.org/add-to-home-screen</a>) in combination with Apple's guidelines. Doing so allows your web apps to launch from user's home screens, with or without Chrome. This is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/00023.jpeg" class="calibre38"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">It is important that you avoid duplicating homescreen prompts by not loading the Add to Home Screen library unless needed. The simplest way I have found to determine if the polyfil is needed is by using feature detecting service worker support. I chose this since browsers supporting service workers have some sort of add to homescreen experience. This may or may not remain true in the future, so be ready to change criteria if things change.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Without going into details, I like to dynamically load JavaScript references when a page is loaded. This process involves a series of feature detections to polyfil various requirements like Promises and the Fetch API:</p>
<pre class="calibre17">        if (!'serviceWorker' in navigator) { 
            //add to homescreen polyfil 
            scripts.unshift("js/libs/addtohomescreen.min.js"); 
        } </pre>
<p>You can read more about dynamically loading scripts in <em class="calibre39">Jake Archibald's article </em><em class="calibre39">(</em><a href="https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/script-loading" target="_blank" class="calibre40">https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/script-loading</a><em class="calibre39">)</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">You will also need to dynamically add the add to homescreen stylesheet. This time, add a feature detection script to your document's <kbd class="calibre12">HEAD</kbd>:</p>
<pre class="calibre17">    &lt;script&gt; 
        if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) { 
 
            // add addToHomeScreen CSS 
            cssLink = document.createElement("link"); 
 
            cssLink.id = "addToHomeScreen"; 
            cssLink.rel = "stylesheet"; 
            cssLink.type = "text/css"; 
            cssLink.href = "css/libs/addtohomescreen.css"; 
            document.head.appendChild(cssLink); 
 
        } 
    &lt;/script&gt; </pre>
<p class="calibre2">Users have been able to install web apps like this since the iPhone was released, but the process is manual and largely unknown by end users and developers alike. The lack of an automated prompt has been a key missing component of this feature. The experience it creates seems to be a model that the Chrome team and other platforms modeled to surface the progressive web application homescreen prompt.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Matteo's library only prompts the user and starts them down the manual process. but there are still a few extra steps that aren't intuitive that users must complete. The new native add to homescreen process has a pseudo automatic pipeline you can integrate. I think the add to homescreen library may serve as a good reference for designing your experience, so it is worth your time to look at it.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Should you polyfil response caching?</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">Request caching can also be polyfiled using IndexedDB. However, now that most browsers support service workers and caching, I don't think this approach has a wise use of resources. Outside of mobile use, Internet Explorer is the main browser without service worker support. At the time of writing this book, IE should really be used primarily in enterprises when their line of business applications have not been upgraded to modern standards.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This means a very small percentage of potential users that may open your PWA will do so in a browser without service worker support. When they do, it is pretty safe to say that they are most likely on a desktop of some sort with a reliable network connection.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Despite developing hundreds of applications using an early implementation of client-side asset caching, I have officially deprecated this approach from my recommendations.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">When Windows 8 shipped, Microsoft quietly shipped support for what they called a <strong class="calibre4">Hosted Web App</strong> (<strong class="calibre4">HWA</strong>). These are websites that reference a valid web manifest file and are served via HTTPS.</p>
<p class="calibre2">HWAs were an early precursor to progressive web apps. The obvious difference is no service worker requirement, which you would expect since the concept of a service worker had not be created yet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To be a HWA, you would create a <kbd class="calibre12">.appx</kbd> file for your application containing the manifest file and a reference to the public URL. Then, you would submit the HWA appx to the Windows Store and consumers could install the HWA from the store.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The advantage of being a HWA is that these web apps have full access to all the Windows platform APIs, just like any native application. The reason that they have this privilege is that once installed, they form the store and are full blown applications.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The main difference is that the UI components and business logic are all just web pages. This gives you the benefit of also being able to update the application immediately, without going through the audit delays that plague all mobile app stores.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In many ways, this is a cross between a traditional native app and the WebAPK functionality supported by Chrome on Android.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Microsoft even created an online tool called Manifoldjs to help with the HWA creation and submission process. In recent years, Manifold has been remodeled and has a new name, PWA Builder (<a href="https://pwabuilder.com" class="calibre9">https://pwabuilder.com</a>).</p>
<p class="calibre2">Today, PWA Builder takes any public website and provides the resources to convert it into a Progressive Web Application and submit it not only to the Windows Store, but also compile Cordova apps for the Apple and Google Play stores.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If you are wondering, there are many HWA and PWAs already in the Windows Store. Twitter and Pandora are a pair of high profile Windows progressive web apps. In fact, Twitter is in the process of deprecating all their native apps to PWA in the future.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I will go into more detail about PWA Builder in <a target="_blank" href="part0222.html#6JMSS0-f12cdcca08b54960b3d271452dc7667d" class="calibre9">Chapter 10</a>, <em class="calibre13">Service Worker Tools</em>. Trust me, you will not want to skip this chapter, as PWA Builder and the other tools we have mentioned have all become staples of my PWA workflow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Today, Microsoft Edge supports service workers, which means that the concept of HWA has evolved into the consumption of progressive web apps. The same process applies to store submission and you still have full, native application capabilities.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Windows 8 and Internet Explorer also support native Live Tiles for web applications pinned to the start screen. When Edge and Windows 10 were released, Live Tile support did not make the cut. This does not mean you cannot add websites to the start menu, though.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In Microsoft Edge, the user can open the menu via the <kbd class="calibre12">...</kbd> icon in the top right corner. This exposes a menu of many options, one being pin this page to Start. Another option is to add the page to the taskbar:</p>
<div><img src="img/00024.jpeg" class="calibre41"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">As you may recall, Internet Explorer supported a rich pinned site feature in the Windows 7 era. Recently, support for the pinned sites has returned. Like iOS, you can customize this experience via <kbd class="calibre12">meta</kbd> tags:</p>
<pre class="calibre17">&lt;meta name="application-name" content="2048" /&gt; 
&lt;meta name="msapplication-square70x70logo" content="meta/2048-logo-70x70.png" /&gt; 
&lt;meta name="msapplication-square150x150logo" content="meta/2048-logo-152x152.png" /&gt; 
&lt;meta name="msapplication-wide310x150logo" content="meta/2048-logo-310x150.png" /&gt; 
&lt;meta name="msapplication-square310x310logo" content="meta/2048-logo-310x310.png" /&gt; 
&lt;meta name="msapplication-TileColor" content="#ECC400" /&gt; </pre>
<p class="calibre2">Pinned sites still work from Internet Explorer, but as enterprises upgrade to Windows 10, the use of Internet Explorer as a primary browser is quickly fading. This does not mean you should skip the pinned site meta data. I still include it, for now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don't want to put these solutions in a negative space because they are both good first attempts to advance the web platform to give users a better user experience. Maybe you can see how these attempts have served as a reference for the modern web manifest specification.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now that Microsoft Edge has shipped service workers, the team is busy working on what their add to start menu (my term, not theirs) will look like. They provided some early protypes at the 2018 Build conference, but at the time of writing this book, there is nothing definitive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My best guess is that some time in the late summer or early fall we may see something more concrete from Redmond at their annual Edge Developer Summit.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Benefits await without Polyfils</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">Even if you don't polyfil the add to homescreen behavior, your web application will see user engagement gains on iOS and other non-PWA platforms. Many companies are publicly sharing their improvements in various progressive web application case studies.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wego, an online air travel booking service, reported a 50% increase in conversions and 35% longer sessions on iOS. Mynet increased page views by 15%, and a 23% lower bounce rate on iOS. Lancôme increased iOS sessions by 53%. These are just a small sampling of positive progressive web application case studies.</p>
<p class="calibre2">These companies are reaping the rewards of PWAs on iOS because, by nature, properly architected websites perform better. Plus, creating a progressive web application forces you to put the customer first, not the developer. When you do this, you create a better user experience, which directly correlates to improved key performance indicators.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Following progressive web application guidelines forces you to deliver a user first experience that works across all platforms.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Testing the add to homescreen experience in Chrome</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">The developer experience would not be complete without the ability to test the add to homescreen experience. Chrome has added tooling which allows you to see how your web manifest file is interpreted and manually trigger the prompt.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Launch Chrome's developer tools by using <em class="calibre13">F12</em> and select the Application tab. There are many choices to help you debug various aspects of a progressive web application. Under Application, there is a Manifest choice. This will display the properties of your web manifest file, including each icon. This is a quick way for you to determine if your manifest is interpreted correctly, as you can see in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/00025.gif" class="calibre42"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">There is also a link to manually trigger the Add to Home Screen experience. Check out the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/00026.gif" class="calibre43"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">Clicking the link in the developer tools will trigger the Add to homescreen prompt. Take a look at the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/00027.jpeg" class="calibre44"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">The best way to test your experience is to deploy your progressive web app to the cloud, with HTTPS enabled. Open your site in a PWA supporting browser and do your best to adhere to the rules to trigger the add to homescreen prompt.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is always a best practice to test your site across multiple devices. I recommend at least one iPhone, Android, and desktop with multiple browsers. Having these real user experiences available gives you confidence that your deployed PWA works as expected.</p>

<p class="calibre2">The line between native and progressive web applications is very blurred, thanks in part to the web manifest and add to home screen experience. No longer is the homescreen reserved to native applications; the web is welcomed by all platforms.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Today, most browsers provide a first-class app experience for progressive web applications, and while Apple has yet to adopt the progressive web application standards, they were the first to make the web into an app experience. It is up to developers and businesses to adopt and implement the rich add to homescreen capabilities.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Triggering the add to homescreen experience is the first step in levelling up your web presence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if the user has not added your PWA to their homescreen, you can still take advantage of progressive web app features. However, before we dive into service workers, let's take a look at adding SSL to your website.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The next chapter covers security or use of HTTPS, which is one of the three primary technical requirements so that an app can be a Progressive Web App.</p>
