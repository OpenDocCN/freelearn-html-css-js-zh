- en: Wijmo is a new JavaScript library focusing on user interface widgets. It builds
    on jQuery UI, enhancing existing widgets, and adding new ones. In this book we
    examine the Wijmo widgets essential for web development. The useful configuration
    options for 15 widgets are covered along with their usage scenarios. Most of the
    chapters take a code recipe approach for tasks that occur often in web development.
    Whenever you come across a widget or user interface component that you've implemented
    before, chances are that Wijmo widgets have you covered. The chapters in this
    book are designed to get you started using the widgets in no time. On the other
    hand, [Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Dashboard with WijmoGrid"), *Dashboard
    with Wijmo Grid*, takes a different approach in building an application and explaining
    how it works.

    Wijmo. However, if you're experiencing Wijmo for the first time, I would recommend
    going in the same order as the chapters.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will need a text editor with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML syntax highlighting.
    Notepad++ on Windows or Textmate on Mac is sufficient. Developing with Wijmo does
    not require fancy editor features, such as auto-complete or warnings for JavaScript.
    The widgets are simple and easy to use.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Besides a text editor, you also need a web browser. An Internet Explorer version
    higher than Version 5, Firefox, Safari, or Chrome are all supported by Wijmo.
    You probably already have one installed and prefer one over another.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The primary audience for this book are the web developers working on projects
    that require the use of ready-made widgets. jQuery UI lacks necessary components
    or features, whereas Wijmo provides both free, open source widgets, as well as
    a licensed option for more complex widgets. Since this book covers both the areas,
    developers working on open source projects can also benefit.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since Wijmo is easy to use, many of the simpler examples can be understood by
    a beginner with JavaScript. When the previous condition is met, this book is the
    first book that a JavaScript beginner should read after learning jQuery. Learning
    how to use Wijmo widgets will reduce the unnecessary work of writing custom JavaScript.
