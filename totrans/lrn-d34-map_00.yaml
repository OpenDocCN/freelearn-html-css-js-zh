- en: This book explores the JavaScript library D3\. js and its ability to help us
    create maps and amazing visualizations. You will no longer be confined to third-party
    tools in order to get a nice looking map. With D3\. js, you can build your own
    maps and customize them as you please. This book will go from the basics of SVG,
    Canvas, and JavaScript, through to data trimming and modification with TopoJSON.
    Using D3\. js to glue together these key ingredients, we will create very attractive
    maps that cover many common use cases, such as choropleths, data overlays on maps,
    interactivity, and performance.
