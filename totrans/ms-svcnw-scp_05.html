                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Business rules are usually the most used server-side scripting method. It is possible to use business rules in a basic way that simply requires configuration, rather than customization. I will say that for the majority of requirements that need a business rule, you will most often need to add some sort of customization in the form of scripts.</p>
<p><span>A particularly helpful aspect of business rules is the different ways they can be triggered. This allows us to run our server-side scripts at different times, based on actions that occur to a record.</span></p>
<p>When first viewing the business rule form, there are two options for when to run the business rule. These are upon the insert or update of the record. With the business rule in this essentially basic view, we can configure the business rule to run on a filter condition or ownership of a role and change field values. If we want to do more than this, which is often the case, we need to tick the advanced tick box on the form.</p>
<p>Once the advanced tick box has been checked, we then have four options for what action the business rule should run on. Let's look at what these are and when, exactly, they run:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Insert</span>: Runs when a new record is inserted</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Update</span>: Runs when a record is updated</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Delete</span>: Runs when a record is deleted</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Query</span>: Runs when records of this type are searched against</li>
</ul>
<p>The time that a business rule runs is also dependent on the value of the <span class="packt_screen">When</span> field. Here, we also have four options to choose from:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Before</span>: Runs before the record is saved</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">After</span>: Runs straight after the record is saved</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Async</span>: Runs when the scheduler runs a scheduled job that gets sent to the scheduled job queue after the record is saved</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Display</span>: Runs before the form is loaded, after the data has been fetched from the database</li>
</ul>
<p>It is best to use before business rules when you are updating the record itself; then the changes are made before the insert or update, and so the record only updates once. After business rules should be used when the script does not affect the current record, so the script can run after a save.</p>
<p>Async will run at some point in the future, so I would only use this if the actions taken in the script do not need to be seen straight away. This can be for queuing up events for notifications or sending jobs out from ServiceNow. Display business rules are best used to hold data in a scratchpad so that a client-side script can utilize it. This is helpful, as it stops client-side script from having to make a round-trip to the server, as the display business rule has already collected the data needed.</p>
<p>Using these checkboxes and the <span class="packt_screen">When</span> field in combination gives a good selection of triggers for running our server-side script. The most common tends to be a before or after <span class="packt_screen">When</span> field value with the insert and update checkboxes ticked.</p>
<p>With the advanced box ticked, we can also see the advanced form section. This gives us the condition for running the script and a script field to put our server-side code into.</p>
<p>Now that we've had a look at the form of a business rule, let's have a look at how we add script. All we need to do is set up the form for when we want the script to run, add a condition if appropriate, and add our code in the script field.</p>
<p>As an example, we'll set a network category incident to a high impact when created. For this, we need to add a condition in the <span class="packt_screen">condition</span> field:</p>
<pre>current.category == 'network'</pre>
<p>This <span class="packt_screen">condition</span> field is helpful to stop running through scripts when it is not necessary. In the preceding code, we will only run our script if the category is <kbd>network</kbd>.</p>
<p>Now we'll look at the script we will run:</p>
<pre>(function executeRule(current, previous /*null when async*/) {<br/><br/>  current.impact = '1'; //High Impact<br/><br/>})(current, previous);</pre>
<p>First, let's look at the code ServiceNow gives us for a business rule. The <kbd>executeRule</kbd> function we are provided with has two parameters: <kbd>current</kbd> and <kbd>previous</kbd>. <kbd>current</kbd> is the object that holds all the current values of the record when the business rule is triggered. <kbd>previous</kbd> is the object that holds the value of the record before any updates were made, essentially holding the previous values. Previous can only be used with the <kbd>update</kbd> and <kbd>delete</kbd> actions.</p>
<p>Our example sets the impact to high for network category incidents. For our example, we would set the <span class="packt_screen">When</span> field to <span class="packt_screen">before</span>, which means we do not need to add any script to update the record, as we are changing the current record before it is being saved. We also need to check the insert checkbox on our business rule. We can see the business rule itself in <em>Figure 5.1</em>:</p>

<p>This gives an overview of how business rules work, and they are very well used across the ServiceNow platform.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">UI actions</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p class="mce-root">UI actions are the buttons, context menu selections, links, and list selections that you find throughout ServiceNow. Because you can make UI actions appear in different areas of the platform, they can be incredibly handy to add your script to.</p>
<p>I tend to find that the form buttons are most used for UI actions. These can be added as helpful additional buttons to add functionality or ways to move records through different states of a process.</p>
<p>A UI action normally runs on the server side; however, we can run them on the client side, too, as we explored in the client-side chapters. By using the tick boxes, we can run UI actions on an insert when the record is created or on an update once the record already exists.</p>
<p>First, let's take a look at the different ways you can display a UI action to the user. By ticking the relevant checkboxes, a UI action you create can be displayed in one or multiple ways. Let's have a look at these options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Form button</strong>: This displays the the UI action as a button on the form, similar to the <span class="packt_screen">Update</span> button</li>
<li><strong>Form context menu</strong>: Displays the UI action in the context menu, the menu that appears when you right-click the header bar of the form</li>
<li><strong>Form link</strong>: Displays the UI action as a link in the related links section, which appears between the form sections and related lists</li>
<li><strong>List banner button</strong>: Displays the UI action as a button at the top of a list view, next to the table label</li>
<li><strong>List bottom button</strong>: Shows the UI action at the bottom of a list as a button</li>
<li><strong>List context menu</strong>: Displays the UI action in the list context menu, accessed by right-clicking in a list of records</li>
<li><strong>List choice</strong>: The UI actions appear in the choices of actions on selected rows at the bottom of the list</li>
<li><strong>List link</strong>: Shows the UI action in the related links section at the bottom of a list</li>
</ul>
<p>In a similar way to business rules, we also get a condition and script field for UI actions. However, the script field starts blank on a UI action, so the developer must provide all of the code.</p>
<p>We'll take a look at scripting a basic UI action. For our example, we'll build a form button to change an incident state to <kbd>In progress</kbd>. Let's take a look at the code we need:</p>
<pre>//Moves the incident state to In progress<br/>current.state = 2; //In progress<br/>current.update();<br/><br/>action.setRedirectURL(current);</pre>
<p>In the preceding code, we set the state to the value of <kbd>2</kbd>, which corresponds to the <kbd>In progress</kbd> state for incidents. Once this value has been set, all we need to do is update the record using <kbd>current.update</kbd>.</p>
<p>The <kbd>action.setRedirectURL</kbd> line is used in UI actions to redirect to the current record once the server-side script has run. If no redirection code is used when a UI action is pressed on a form, it will move back to the previous screen, usually the list view the record was selected from.</p>
<p>In our script, this redirection line is saying that once the code has run, redirect the page to somewhere different; in our example, we use <kbd>current</kbd> as the current record. This then redirects back to the record we are on. This is helpful if we want to keep the user on the same record and show them the changes our UI action has made. In this case, the user should be able to see the state change.</p>
<p>We can see the UI action in <em>Figure 5.2</em>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-471 image-border" src="assets/b76204ed-953e-4ea2-a92d-be09ac157d2a.png" style="width:105.92em;height:89.92em;"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Figure 5.2: UI action that moves the state field to In progress</div>
<p>Here, we are only using our UI action as a form button, but we could also display it in other ways by using the tick boxes on the right. This UI action will appear on new and existing incident forms with the <span class="packt_screen">Show insert</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Show update</span> tick boxes checked.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Access controls</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Access controls are a security aspect of ServiceNow, and whether access is given is mainly governed by configured roles. However, if a more complex calculation as to whether users are allowed access <span>is required, </span>we need to use script to account for this.</p>
<p>Generally, access controls are defined without the need for scripting, but there are still a fair amount of scenarios that require code to be used. These are often when information about a user is needed further than their roles; for example, their group membership or company.</p>
<p>To amend access controls, you need to have the <span class="packt_screen">security_admin</span> role and ensure that you elevate privileges and use it before trying to make changes to them. To get to the scripting aspect of an access control, you need to tick the advanced checkbox. Once this is done, the script field will appear at the bottom of the form.</p>
<p>For each access control, a user is only granted access if they match all three aspects of the access control: the role, condition, and script. This is worth remembering when writing your access scripts, as it could be a role or condition stopping access, rather than the code you have written.</p>
<p>Now let's take a look at some access control code. Here, we will allow write access to the task number field if the user is part of the current assignment group:</p>
<pre>gs.getUser().isMemberOf(current.assignment_group);</pre>
<p>This example will allow the user access if they are a member of the current assignment group. The script in an access control needs to set an answer variable to true or false, or simply evaluate to true or false. In the example, we are just using the evaluation method.</p>
<p>In <em>Figure 5.3</em>, we can see the whole access control, allowing write access to the task number field. This would apply to task tables; for example, incident, change, and problem:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/d4dd062c-1770-4d73-a7aa-fdf9cefc05fd.png" style="width:53.00em;height:44.25em;"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Figure 5.3: Access control for the Number field on the Task table</div>
<p>Access control scripting can be fairly short, and you tend to not get such complicated code here, but getting the right code is very important, as access controls can become a very complicated area of ServiceNow, with many rules applying and not applying to grant or disallow access for users.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Server-side scripting is generally preferred to client-side scripting, so it should be used where possible. As server-side script tends to run away from the user frontend, it is less likely to affect loading times that a user would see as a poor user experience. </p>
<p>That said, it is still advisable to configure before customizing and avoid scripting at all, wherever possible. This is because script is harder to maintain and is more likely to cause issues between releases of ServiceNow.</p>
<p>Let's explore some common uses for server-side scripting and how to best achieve these tasks.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Changing form values is usually best achieved by a business rule or UI action. If you want to change values when a user makes a click, then a UI action is best; however, if you simply want the values to change at all times when certain conditions are met, then a business rule is better. It is best to use a before business rule so that the form is only updated once.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>When restricting access to forms and fields, it is best to use an access control. An access control will restrict access no matter how a form is accessed, so it is a powerful tool. If you only need to use roles or conditions to control access to forms and fields, then that is the preferred method, as this is classed as configuration and is easier to maintain. </p>
<p>If your access requirements are more complicated or convoluted than this, though, you will need to add script to the access control. The most common reasons for this are that a user needs to be part of certain groups or the user is referenced in fields on the form.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Sometimes, you may want to pass values to the client side because they will not be visible on the loaded form, and these values may be useful for running client scripts. In this instance, you will want to use a display business rule. This allows scratchpad values to be set in the display business rule, which can then be used in client-side script on the form.</p>
<p>If you are considering calling the server from an <kbd>onLoad</kbd> client script, then it is usually better to use a display business rule instead, as this eliminates the need for an extra call to the server.</p>
<p>We can see what a display business rule looks like in <em>Figure 5.4</em>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-472 image-border" src="assets/1ea516bb-7de8-439c-9dd2-0032485309dd.png" style="width:126.58em;height:54.67em;"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Figure 5.4: Display business rule example</div>
<p>It is worth noting that once we pick the <span class="packt_screen">When to run</span> field as display, we no longer have the <span class="packt_screen">Insert</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Update</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Delete</span>, or <span class="packt_screen">Query</span> checkboxes available to select. This is because a display business rule always runs at the same time, just before the form is loaded.</p>

<p>We have looked at a few examples of when to script on the server and the best way to do it in various scenarios. Server-side scripting is usually much more common than client-side scripting and accounts for the majority of code in most ServiceNow instances.</p>
<p>Therefore, we are really just beginning to look at the possibilities of server-side scripting. There is great potential in the code that can be written, and we will explore some more advanced methods in the following chapter.</p>

<p>As with client-side scripting, there are a few ways to test server-side scripts. These are generally less immediate than the client-side debugging techniques, but essential when working to fix your code.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The first logging technique we will look at is <kbd>gs.log</kbd>. This was a very popular technique, and still is fairly widely used by developers. As we saw in <a href="45863911-2233-475a-96b7-b076a4277a55.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a><em>,</em> <em>Exploring the ServiceNow Glide Class</em>, <kbd>gs.log</kbd> lets us send logs to the system log with a script source so we can send messages as a piece of code executes. </p>
<p>We can create a <kbd>gs.log</kbd> from any server-side script, which makes it very useful; however, we cannot use it in a scoped application. We will have a look at scoped application logging later. As long as you are in the global scope, you can use <kbd>gs.log</kbd> and send messages to the system logs.</p>
<p>Let's remind ourselves of a simple piece of code using a <kbd>gs.log</kbd>:</p>
<pre>gs.log('Server Side Log Message');</pre>
<p>This log will appear in the <span class="packt_screen">Script Log Statements</span> module in the application navigator when the script runs. We can also show the values of variables at certain stages in a script using this method. We could use this to display the caller on an incident record:</p>
<pre>var user = current.caller_id;<br/>gs.log('The current caller is ' + user);</pre>
<p>This would display the current caller of an incident in the logs if used in a business rule. We can use the plus symbol to add strings and variables to our logging.</p>
<p>This method allows us to add as many logs as we like to our scripts to check that methods were called or the values of variables at certain points in the code.</p>
<div class="packt_tip">Remember to remove all of your <kbd>gs.log</kbd> statements or comment them out before putting your code live. Leaving too many logging lines in code can make the system logs difficult to debug.</div>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Logging in scoped applications</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>As we discovered when we looked at <kbd>gs.log</kbd>, it does not work in scoped applications. For logging in scoped applications, we need to use a different method. In fact, there are four methods that can be used.</p>
<p>The four levels of logging in a scoped application are:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>Error</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>Warn</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>Info</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>Debug</kbd></li>
</ul>
<p>This type of logging works in a very similar way to <kbd>gs.log</kbd>, but with the different levels of log replacing the word <kbd>log</kbd> after <kbd>gs</kbd>. </p>
<p>Let's have a look at how to write a basic script for each:</p>
<pre>gs.error('Error log');<br/>gs.warn('Warn log');<br/>gs.info('Info log');<br/>gs.debug('Debug log');</pre>
<p>These logs are visible in the application logs table, which can be viewed by going to <span class="packt_screen">System Logs</span> | <span class="packt_screen">System Log</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Application Logs</span>. </p>
<p>By default, when you create a new application scope, only error, warn, and info messages are displayed, as set by the system property related to the scope. This property will be named <kbd>&lt;scope name&gt;.logging.verbosity</kbd> and can be set at any of the four levels. For each level set, it will show messages at that level and any higher-level message types. As the default value for the property is info, we will see all messages, apart from debug.</p>
<p>In general, a lot of developers will simply use info messages as a generic way to debug script on the server side. However, if you are building debugging into the scoped application being created, it is better to use all of the level types for a more complete solution.</p>

<p>ServiceNow also provides some server-side debugger assistance in the form of session debugging. These are mainly listed as modules in the <span class="packt_screen">System Diagnostics</span> application, but there is also security debugging available in the <span class="packt_screen">System Security</span> application.</p>
<p>By clicking on these modules, you activate the debugging for that particular area; for example, business rules. This lasts for the session, or until you turn the debugging off by using the <span class="packt_screen">Disable All</span> module.</p>
<p>I have found that these modules can be useful, mainly for the security rule debugging, but are not generally comprehensively used by developers.</p>

<p>The script debugger has been introduced in the Istanbul release for use in server-side scripting. This allows developers to set break points in any server-side script, to then step through in the debugger.</p>
<p>To use the debugger, you must first click the left margin in a script to create a break point. Then, to load the script debugger, navigate to <span class="packt_screen">System Diagnostics</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Script Debugger</span>. The script debugger appears in a new window, where you can see the break points created in the script, as in <em>Figure 5.5</em>:</p>

<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Figure 5.5: Script debugger stepping through the incident events business rule</div>
<p class="mce-root">Once the debugger is opened, trigger the script, and you are given the option to <span class="packt_screen">Start Debugging,</span> which will allow you to step through the script.</p>
<p>This can be a helpful tool if you need to find out where issues are in a script and are unsure of where in the script the problem lies. This is also a good tool for longer scripts often housed in script includes.</p>

<p>Now that we have seen how the basics of server-side scripting work, we can take a look at some scripting examples to further our knowledge of how to use these introductory server-side techniques.</p>
<p>We'll start with a further business rule example.</p>
<p>This time, we will create a before delete business rule to ensure that directors are not deleted. We need to set the business rule to advanced; select the <span class="packt_screen">delete</span> checkbox and <span class="packt_screen">before</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">When</span> field. Let's have a look at the code:</p>
<pre>(function executeRule(current, previous /*null when async*/) {<br/><br/>  if (current.title == 'Director') {<br/>    gs.addErrorMessage('Cannot delete Director');<br/>    current.setAbortAction(true);<br/>    action.setRedirectURL(current);<br/>  }<br/><br/>})(current, previous);</pre>
<p>Here, we are checking whether the user is a director using the <span class="packt_screen">title</span> field, and if so, using <kbd>setAbortAction</kbd> to stop the <kbd>delete</kbd> going ahead. To ensure the user is kept informed, we are also using <kbd>addErrorMessage</kbd> to display a message to the user and <kbd>action.setRedirectURL</kbd> to keep the user on the current record, so that they can see that the <kbd>delete</kbd> did not go ahead.</p>
<p>The rule can be seen in <em>Figure 5.6</em>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/307d57aa-70e8-4d80-9a96-61f2879fd280.png"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Figure 5.6: Business rule to stop director deletion</div>
<p class="mce-root">Next, we'll take a look at a UI action example. For this UI action, we will make a button to assign an incident to ourselves. Firstly, we will add a condition to only make the button appear on the form if it is a current member of the assignment group:</p>
<pre>­gs.getUser().­isMemberOf(current.assignment_group)</pre>
<p>This line ensures that the logged-in user is a member of the assignment group, so that the incident can be assigned to them. The code we need to assign the incident to the user looks like this:</p>
<pre>//Assign to the current logged in user<br/>current.assigned_to = gs.getUserID();<br/>current.update();</pre>
<p>The two lines set the assigned to value of the incident to the current logged-in user and then update the record to save the changes. This is quite a simple UI action, but one that is very helpful.</p>
<p>Here, in <em>Figure 5.7</em>, we see the UI action we created:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-473 image-border" src="assets/6ea81b64-391f-49f4-a219-e7353090274e.png" style="width:126.67em;height:116.17em;"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Figure 5.7: UI action to assign an incident to the logged in user</div>
<p><span>Often with UI actions, the script may not need to be that long to be an effective solution and add value to the user.</span></p>
<p>Finally, we will take a look at an access control script example. Sometimes it may be necessary to restrict access to a single group and exclude even system admins from seeing records.</p>
<p>We will use the change request table for this example, but obviously, other read access controls exist that would need to be deactivated for our new access control to work. We will only allow the <kbd>eCAB Approval</kbd> group access to <kbd>Software</kbd> category changes.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the code:</p>
<pre>answer = false;<br/> if (current.category == 'Software') {<br/>  if (gs.getUser().isMemberOf('eCAB Approval')) {<br/>    answer = 'true';<br/>  }<br/>} else {<br/>  answer = 'true';<br/>}</pre>
<p>Here, we are allowing access if the category is not <kbd>Software</kbd>; or, if it is <kbd>Software</kbd>, the user must be a member of the <kbd>eCAB Approval</kbd> group. We are clearing the <span class="packt_screen">Admin</span> <span class="packt_screen">overrides</span> checkbox, so even an admin will need to adhere to the rule to gain access. We also add the <kbd>itil</kbd> role to the rule to ensure that this role is needed for access to be given.</p>
<p>We can see the rule that we have created in <em>Figure 5.8</em>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/2744e7b6-86e1-487a-a94f-526dd10ade02.png"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Figure 5.8: Access control to restrict access to the Software category to eCAB Approval group members</div>
<p>This type of access control can be useful for sensitive information that perhaps even a system admin may not be able to view.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we looked at the basics of server-side scripting through business rules, UI actions, and access controls. We saw the various different runtimes of business rules and the multiple ways a UI action can be displayed to the user. We took a look at when it is appropriate to write server-side script and some examples of common uses, as well as how to test server-side script. We also saw some practical examples of server-side scripting using learned techniques.</p>
<p>In the following chapter, we will be looking at the advanced side of server-side scripting, including script includes, scheduled jobs, and background scripts. We will also look at how to script in workflows and script actions, as well as how to set up events. We will introduce these server-side advanced topics and show you some practical examples.</p>
