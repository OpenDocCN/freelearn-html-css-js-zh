<h1 class="chapterTitle" id="_idParaDest-223">All About Rulers</h1>
<p class="normal">One of the handiest tools in an artist’s toolbox is the humble ruler. Whether it’s a regular straight ruler, a set square, or a set of French curves, rulers can really make a difference to your artwork.</p>
<p class="normal">Ruler tools in Clip Studio Paint work just like straight rulers or curved rulers in real life, except that they’re digital—and they can be customized and made to produce certain special effects easily, such as all lines going to a specific focal point (or even curving to a specific focal point). If you draw or ink in the digital realm, you want to make sure you’re familiar with these amazing tools.</p>
<p class="normal">We will cover the following key topics in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Introducing rulers and their types</li>
<li class="bulletList">Using rulers in Clip Studio Paint</li>
<li class="bulletList">Using the symmetry ruler</li>
<li class="bulletList">Focus and parallel line rulers</li>
<li class="bulletList">Understanding perspective rulers</li>
<li class="bulletList">Making rulers inactive</li>
<li class="bulletList">Drawing an ellipse in perspective</li>
<li class="bulletList">Switching the active ruler</li>
<li class="bulletList">Using grids and guides</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">We are going to take a deep dive into the special rulers in Clip Studio Paint in this chapter. We will briefly cover the basic rulers, and then we’ll take a more in-depth look at the other ruler options and how they can be applied to drawing manga.</p>
<p class="normal">Now, let’s get right into rulers!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-224">Technical requirements</h1>
<p class="normal">To get started, you need Clip Studio Paint already installed on your device, and a new canvas opened with a white-colored paper layer. Any size is fine, but I recommend creating a 300 dpi square canvas to work through the content in this chapter.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-225">Introducing rulers and their types in Clip Studio Paint</h1>
<p class="normal">When you draw <a id="_idIndexMarker964"/>a straight line digitally, you just need to pick the <strong class="screenText">Straight line</strong> sub <a id="_idIndexMarker965"/>tool from the <strong class="screenText">Direct draw</strong> tool group, and then click and drag. And it’s done! It’s quite a simple task. But when you want to create one with a textured brush, you need a ruler to guide you to create a straight line, no matter how steady your hand moves are. Alternatively, if you are going for a three-vanishing point perspective drawing, you need an accurate guide! Yes, there are good ruler tools for all these options.</p>
<p class="normal">There are not only straight, <strong class="screenText">Linear</strong> rulers but also <strong class="screenText">Curve</strong> rulers, <strong class="screenText">Figure</strong> rulers, <strong class="screenText">Ruler pen</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Special</strong> rulers, guides, <strong class="screenText">Perspective</strong> rulers, and <strong class="screenText">Symmetrical</strong> rulers available in Clip Studio Paint, which you can see in <em class="italic">Figure 13.1</em>. They will be introduced one by one with examples in this chapter. So if you get confused about which ruler is best for you, you can always come back to this chapter to check the descriptions with rich sample screenshots!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-226">Using rulers</h1>
<p class="normal">In this section, we<a id="_idIndexMarker966"/> are going to get to know the different ruler types, as well as how to snap to and manipulate rulers in Clip Studio Paint. Each ruler has its use, and they will surely help you to create accurate lines and shapes exactly how you need them to be!</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s find out what rulers are available first and try using them. You will find the ruler sub tools under the <strong class="screenText">Ruler</strong> section in the toolbar.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_13_13.1.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.1: Screenshot of the Ruler Sub Tool palette</p>
<p class="normal">The first four tools, <strong class="screenText">Linear ruler</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Curve ruler</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Figure ruler</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Ruler pen</strong>, are the tools that we will briefly cover in this section. The tools listed below these four are a little more complex, and we’ll delve into them in more detail as the chapter continues.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-227">Ruler snapping options</h2>
<p class="normal">Before we get into<a id="_idIndexMarker967"/> how to use each of the ruler tools, we need to learn about the snapping options. When a ruler doesn’t work as expected, most of the time, it is because snapping is turned on or off. So when getting undesired results with the ruler tools, it is best to check these options first. </p>
<p class="normal">The three snapping options can be found in the command bar above the area where the currently active document is displayed. They are shown in Figure 13.2.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_13_13.2.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.2: Screenshot of the ruler snapping options</p>
<p class="normal">From left to right, these options are <strong class="screenText">Snap to Ruler</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Snap to Special Ruler</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Snap to Grid</strong>. In the preceding screenshot, the <strong class="screenText">Snap to Ruler</strong> option is the only one currently turned on and is marked by a light blue box. Now, let’s look at what exactly they do:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Snap to Ruler</strong> constricts the marks made by the current tools to any active basic ruler (linear ruler, figure ruler, ruler pen, and so on). If the active ruler is a special ruler, such as a perspective ruler, this option will not force the drawing tool to follow that ruler.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Snap to Special Ruler</strong> forces tools to restrict their marks to any currently active special ruler, such as symmetry, focus line, and perspective rulers.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Snap to Grid</strong> forces tools to stay within the confines of the grid when it is visible. There’ll be more on the grid later in this chapter.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">To turn a snap option on or off, simply click on it. Multiple snapping options can be active at one time. Remember that the snapping options will force your tools to constrain themselves to any currently active ruler that fits their criteria, so if you have a drawing tool that isn’t drawing where you want it to and you have a ruler in your image, check the snapping option first to see whether that is the issue!</p>
<p class="normal">Now that we’ve<a id="_idIndexMarker968"/> discussed snapping, let’s move on to the basic rulers and their functions.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-228"><img alt="A black line on a white background  Description automatically generated" src="img/Icon_1_Linear_ruler1.png"/> Linear ruler</h2>
<p class="normal">The linear ruler<a id="_idIndexMarker969"/> works<a id="_idIndexMarker970"/> just the same as a regular old ruler that you might buy in any store. It is the simplest of rulers, used for making a single straight line.</p>
<p class="normal">To use the <strong class="screenText">linear ruler</strong>, select the sub tool, click on your canvas, and drag. Release your mouse or stylus once you have reached the end of where you want the ruler to be. The ruler will be shown as a single-colored line, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_13_13.3.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.3: Screenshot of a linear ruler example</p>
<p class="normal">When the <strong class="screenText">Snap to Ruler</strong> option<a id="_idIndexMarker971"/> is active, using a tool such as the G-pen<a id="_idIndexMarker972"/> will make a line along the ruler that we just made, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_13_13.4.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.4: Screenshot of an inking on a linear ruler line</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Need to adjust a<a id="_idIndexMarker973"/> ruler <a id="_idIndexMarker974"/>line that you already made? Use the <strong class="screenText">Operation</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Object</strong> sub tool and select the ruler, which is highlighted in Figure 13.5.</p>
<p class="normal">A bounding box will show up around the ruler, and a handle will appear at either end. By using this bounding box and the handles at either end, the angle and length of the ruler can be changed, the ruler can be resized, and it can even be rotated!</p><div><figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_13_13.5.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.5: Screenshot of the Object sub tool</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="normal">You can draw a<a id="_idIndexMarker975"/> smooth, straight<a id="_idIndexMarker976"/> line with your G-pen thanks to the Linear ruler’s help. How about trying out a curved line? Read on to find out more.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-229"><img alt="A black curved object on a white background  Description automatically generated" src="img/Icon_2_Curve_ruler1.png"/> Curve ruler</h2>
<p class="normal">The curve ruler is<a id="_idIndexMarker977"/> a great help when we draw a mechanic <a id="_idIndexMarker978"/>object that has circles, such as a bicycle, car, motorcycle, and glasses. It supports us in drawing smooth lines, and it is good for editing a ruler shape whichever way you like. However, the curve ruler’s name is a little bit misleading because it can be used to make polyline straight-line rulers as well as rulers with smooth curves, as shown in Figure 13.6.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_13_13.6.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.6: Screenshot of curve ruler examples</p>
<p class="normal">To use the curve ruler, select it from the <strong class="screenText">Ruler</strong> <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> palette. In the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette, you will see four options under the <strong class="screenText">Curve</strong> setting. The very first icon is the <strong class="screenText">Straight</strong> line, which will produce straight lines between the points of your ruler. The second option is the <strong class="screenText">Spline</strong> setting, which will create curves between each point of the ruler. To use either of these options, simply click on the point on the canvas where you want the ruler to start. Then, click again where the second point should be. Continue clicking on each corner of the ruler until you reach the end of where you want the ruler to be. Double-click to end the ruler.</p>
<p class="normal">If you are making an enclosed shape, you can also go all the way around to the point where <a id="_idIndexMarker979"/>you<a id="_idIndexMarker980"/> started the ruler and click on the first point to end it, as shown in Figure 13.7.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_13_13.7.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.7: Screenshot of an enclosed shape</p>
<p class="normal">The final two icons<a id="_idIndexMarker981"/> under the <strong class="screenText">Curve</strong> setting in the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette are <strong class="screenText">Quadratic Bezier</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Cubic Bezier</strong>, which are simply two alternate ways to make and control the curve of the ruler. Let’s learn how to create curves using each of these methods.</p>
<h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-230">Using Quadratic Bezier</h3>
<p class="normal">Using the<a id="_idIndexMarker982"/> Quadratic Bezier tool for a ruler takes a little <a id="_idIndexMarker983"/>getting used to and, usually, involves some refinement after the initial points are laid out. Follow these steps to create a curve ruler with Quadratic Bezier:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Select <strong class="screenText">Curve ruler</strong> and then the <strong class="screenText">Quadratic Bezier</strong> option from the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on the canvas once, at the point where you’d like the ruler to start.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Click on the point where you would like the ruler to start curving. This will create a small square handle at the clicked point.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Move the cursor to another point on the canvas. The line of the ruler will bend according to where the second click was placed and where the cursor is now.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Continue clicking to add boxes and curves to the ruler until it is the desired length. Double-click to end the ruler.</li>
<li class="numberedList">To adjust the ruler, select the <strong class="screenText">Operation</strong> tool | <strong class="screenText">Object</strong> sub tool. Click on the ruler to select it and reveal the handle controls. In Figure 13.8, the control handles are on the straight lines and the actual ruler is the curved line.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_13_13.8.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.8: Screenshot of a Quadratic Bezier example</p>
<p class="normal">To adjust the curve <a id="_idIndexMarker984"/>of the ruler, use the <strong class="screenText">Object</strong> sub tool<a id="_idIndexMarker985"/> to click on one of the dot handles on the control line and drag it to a new position. The ruler in the preceding screenshot has been modified in Figure 13.9.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_13_13.9.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.9: Screenshot of the Quadratic Bezier example adjusted</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s look at a slightly<a id="_idIndexMarker986"/> different method of <a id="_idIndexMarker987"/>drawing a curve line, using Cubic Bezier.</p>
<h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-231">Using Cubic Bezier</h3>
<p class="normal">Another<a id="_idIndexMarker988"/> option<a id="_idIndexMarker989"/> to make curves is by using the <strong class="screenText">Cubic Bezier</strong> setting. Follow these steps to create a ruler using Cubic Bezier:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Select the <strong class="screenText">Cubic Bezier</strong> setting from the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette of the curve ruler.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Click on the first point of the ruler.</li>
<li class="numberedList">When adding the first curve, draw in the direction your line goes. For example, if you start on the left side of the canvas and head toward the right, draw to the right. Going in the direction of the line will prevent the control handles from going in reverse and making “snarls” in the line. The line between the two clicked points will curve.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on a third point and draw to continue making the curve.</li>
<li class="numberedList">To end the ruler, double-click on another point. In this mode, the ruler will end at the point created before the double-click, so be sure the ruler is as long as necessary, click on the endpoint, and then double-click to finish the ruler.</li>
<li class="numberedList">To edit the Cubic Bezier ruler, select the <strong class="screenText">Operation</strong> tool | <strong class="screenText">Object</strong> sub tool. Click on the ruler to reveal the control handles. The control handles are shown by the red lines in Figure 13.10</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_13_13.10.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.10: Screenshot of a Cubic Bezier example</p>
<p class="normal">Using <a id="_idIndexMarker990"/>the <strong class="screenText">Object</strong> tool, the<a id="_idIndexMarker991"/> handles along the red lines can be used to adjust the individual curves by clicking on the handles and dragging them. Clicking on the red squares that appear at the control points allows us to adjust their position. Dragging the red dot handles at either end of the red control line allows us to change the curve on either side of the control point.</p>
<p class="normal">Now that we know how to make curved lines using the Quadratic Bezier and Cubic Bezier<a id="_idIndexMarker992"/> options, we’ll <a id="_idIndexMarker993"/>move on to ready-made figure rulers. </p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-232"><img alt="A black hexagon with white background  Description automatically generated" src="img/Icon_3_Figure_ruler1.png"/> Figure ruler</h2>
<p class="normal">The figure ruler <a id="_idIndexMarker994"/>allows us to create easy circle, rectangle, and <a id="_idIndexMarker995"/>polygon rulers with a few simple clicks. This is the best option to draw a perfect circle! Follow these steps to use the figure ruler:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Select the <strong class="screenText">Figure ruler</strong> sub tool.</li>
<li class="numberedList">In the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette, select one of the shapes from the <strong class="screenText">Figure</strong> tool.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on the canvas and hold down the mouse button or stylus. Drag to create the selected shape ruler on the canvas.</li>
<li class="numberedList">When using the polygon figure option, the number of vertices can be adjusted to create shapes such as triangles, pentagons, and hexagons. To edit the number of vertices, select the ruler, and then click on the <strong class="screenText">Show Sub Tool Detail</strong> <strong class="screenText">Palette</strong> icon at the lower right of the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette. Click on the <strong class="screenText">Figure</strong> tool in the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool Detail</strong> palette. Beneath the <strong class="screenText">Figure</strong> tool is the <strong class="screenText">Number of corners</strong> option, which can be adjusted by using the slider or clicking on the number entry box and entering a number, using the keyboard. In Figure 13.11, the number of corners is <strong class="screenText">3</strong>, which will produce a triangle.</li>
</ol>
<p class="numberedList">Beneath the Figure tool is the <strong class="screenText">Number of corners</strong> option, which can be adjusted by using the slider or clicking on the number entry box and entering a number, using the keyboard. In the following screenshot, the number of corners is <strong class="screenText">3</strong>, which will produce a triangle:</p>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.11: Screenshot of the Figure ruler Sub Tool Detail palette</p>
<p class="normal">After we draw the figure, we can always change its placement and size by selecting the <strong class="screenText">Operation</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Object</strong> tool and clicking the figure. Edit the figure using the control handles.</p>
<p class="normal">If we place a pen anywhere on the figure and start moving along the line, the figure will be drawn smoothly.</p>
<p class="normal">The final basic ruler that we will cover in this section is the versatile ruler pen. Read on to<a id="_idIndexMarker996"/> learn <a id="_idIndexMarker997"/>more about this tool.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-233"><img alt="A black spiral with a white background  Description automatically generated" src="img/Icon_4_Ruler_pen1.png"/> Ruler pen</h2>
<p class="normal">The ruler pen is <a id="_idIndexMarker998"/>a versatile <a id="_idIndexMarker999"/>tool that allows us to draw a ruler of any shape. It has <strong class="screenText">Stability</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Post correction</strong> settings, so we can create a smooth shape when we need to. We can find these settings in the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette or <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool Detail</strong> palette.</p>
<p class="normal">In the following screenshot, I have created a free-hand drawing bird shape with the ruler pen:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_13_13.12.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.12: Screenshot of a Ruler pen example</p>
<p class="normal">Once we have finished <a id="_idIndexMarker1000"/>drawing with the Ruler pen, any drawing tool can be used to trace the ruler!</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Unsure about a layout you have just created? Try using the golden ratio, which is the so-called divine proportion, where you create a sense of beauty through the harmony and proportion of the 1:1.618 ratio.</p>
<p class="normal">In the following image, I have reworked the 1:1 composition on the left into the 1:1.618 composition on the right:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A drawing of a road and a car  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_13_13.13.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.13: Screenshot of two different layouts</p>
<p class="normal">Notice how <a id="_idIndexMarker1001"/>the horizon<a id="_idIndexMarker1002"/> level and character placement are slightly different? We somehow feel more comfortable with this composition.</p>
<p class="normal">The aesthetics of the golden ratio can be applied to an animation storyboard, human face, book cover design, and more. You can add the <strong class="screenText">Golden ratio</strong> scale to your <strong class="screenText">Linear</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Curve</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Figure</strong> rulers as well as <strong class="screenText">Ruler</strong> <strong class="screenText">pen</strong> by turning on <strong class="screenText">Scale</strong>, and then selecting <strong class="screenText">Golden ratio</strong> from the drop-down menu in the <strong class="screenText">Create</strong> <strong class="screenText">ruler</strong> category on the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool Detail</strong> palette:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_13_13.14.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.14: Screenshot of the Sub Tool Detail palette and various rulers with scale</p>
<p class="normal">Similarly, you should remember the <strong class="screenText">rule of thirds</strong> when designing your composition. This is a guideline to place the subject in the left or right third of an image, leaving the other two thirds more open. If you look at the right-hand image of <em class="italic">Figure 13.13</em>, you can actually see this already, in the character placement. This is a good way of managing space when there are multiple elements in a composition, as well as making the composition more natural to look at.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">We have covered how to snap to rulers and basic rulers, such as the ones to create lines, curves, and<a id="_idIndexMarker1003"/> figures, and even covered how to create a <a id="_idIndexMarker1004"/>hand-drawn ruler! Now, we will move on to specialty ruler tools in the following sections.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-234">Using the symmetrical ruler</h2>
<p class="normal">Have you ever <a id="_idIndexMarker1005"/>wanted to create a design that was perfectly <a id="_idIndexMarker1006"/>symmetrical on both sides, or make a beautiful digital mandala? If so, the symmetrical ruler is the answer to your prayers. As a bonus, it’s really simple to use!</p>
<p class="normal">To begin using the symmetry ruler, select the <strong class="screenText">Ruler</strong> tool from the toolbox and then select <strong class="screenText">Symmetrical ruler</strong> from the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> palette. The <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette is shown in Figure 13.15.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_13_13.15.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.15: Screenshot of the Symmetrical ruler tool property</p>
<p class="normal">The most important<a id="_idIndexMarker1007"/> option here in the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette is the <strong class="screenText">Number of lines</strong> option. This controls how many sides of symmetry there will be in the completed ruler. Any number from 2 to 16 can be used in this option. Figure 13.16 shows an example of a ruler with <strong class="screenText">Number of lines</strong> set to <strong class="screenText">2</strong>.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_13_13.16.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.16: Screenshot of a two-line symmetrical ruler drawing</p>
<p class="normal">The thin purple line in the center of the design is the ruler, and the design is mirrored on each side of the ruler’s line.</p>
<p class="normal">This kind of symmetrical drawing is useful when designing manga characters where, on <a id="_idIndexMarker1008"/>some <a id="_idIndexMarker1009"/>elements, we want to add to both the right and left side of the body, as shown in Figure 13.17.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_13_13.17.png"/></figure>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.18: Screenshot of an eight-line symmetrical ruler drawing</p>
<p class="normal">The design now <a id="_idIndexMarker1010"/>has eight symmetrical parts that radiate out <a id="_idIndexMarker1011"/>from the center of the ruler. Figure 13.19 shows a design made with 16 lines, the maximum number a symmetrical ruler can have in Clip Studio Paint.</p>

<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">If desired, sketch a rough layout of your design before creating the ruler.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Select the <strong class="screenText">Symmetrical ruler</strong> sub tool from the <strong class="screenText">Ruler</strong> tool.</li>

<li class="numberedList">Release the mouse or stylus to finish creating the ruler.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Ensure that the <strong class="screenText">Snap to Special Ruler</strong> icon in the top command bar is active in order to use the ruler.</li>
</ol>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Instead of holding down the <em class="italic">Shift</em> key to constrain the angle of the ruler, the <strong class="screenText">Snap angle</strong> option can be used in the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette. Simply check the box next to the option and then set the desired angle using the slider or text entry.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Now that we know how to create and use a symmetrical ruler, let’s learn about some more of <a id="_idIndexMarker1014"/>the specialty rulers and how to use them.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-235">Radial and parallel line rulers</h2>
<p class="normal">Mostly, manga is in a black and white tone, so the lines must be bold and should clearly show actions, as well as the point on which the reader should focus their attention, hence the striking linework. One way that many manga artists do this is by using parallel lines to show motion, as well as radial lines to lead the reader’s eyes to the point of interest in a frame or, in some cases, to express the impact of objects hitting each other. Clip Studio Paint comes with rulers ready to make parallel and radial lines, making the process of creating these effects much easier than with pen and paper.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s look at the following page from my manga adaptation of <em class="italic">A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em>, showing some examples of how to use radial and parallel lines in a comic:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_13_13.20.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.20: Screenshot of a manga comic with focus and parallel lines</p>

<p class="normal">Let’s look at how to create and use the radial line ruler.</p>
<h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-236">Radial line ruler</h3>
<p class="normal">The radial <a id="_idIndexMarker1015"/>line ruler<a id="_idIndexMarker1016"/> allows us to set a central point and then draw lines that radiate out from that point. By using the snapping feature of Clip Studio Paint’s rulers, making radial lines is much quicker and easier than making them in the traditional way with pen and paper. Simply set your central point and start drawing! Follow these steps to make a radial line ruler:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Select the <strong class="screenText">Ruler</strong> tool from the toolbar, and then select the <strong class="screenText">Special ruler</strong> sub tool.</li>
<li class="numberedList">In the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette, click on the drop-down menu to choose the <strong class="screenText">Radial line</strong> option. The drop-down menu is shown in Figure 13.21.</li>

<p class="normal-one">Click on the <a id="_idIndexMarker1017"/>desired central point for the radial line. This is <a id="_idIndexMarker1018"/>the point that all the lines drawn using the ruler will radiate out from.</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="2">Use your desired drawing tool to draw the radial lines. As you draw a line inward toward the center, you will see that the ruler assists you in maintaining a smooth straight trajectory at just the right angle with every stroke. In Figure 13.22, the focus lines have been drawn with the G-pen, and you can see the lines all stretching toward the center at the correct angle.</li>

You can use them in the same way as creating rulers, but lines will automatically be drawn for you—what a time saver!</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">A radial curve<a id="_idIndexMarker1019"/> ruler can also be made. With a radial curve ruler, the lines still <a id="_idIndexMarker1020"/>share the same central point, but they are curved instead of being straight. Follow these steps to create a radial curve ruler:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Select the <strong class="screenText">Radial curve</strong> option from the drop-down menu in the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette.</li>

<li class="numberedList">Use a drawing tool of your choice to draw the focus curves. Figure 13.23 was done with the G-pen tool.</li>

<p class="normal">Now that we’ve covered some of the advanced two-dimensional ruler tools, you can tell the<a id="_idIndexMarker1027"/> differences between linear, curve, figure, ruler<a id="_idIndexMarker1028"/> pen, symmetry, radial, and parallel rulers. Let’s move on to perspective drawing, which is what you’re probably most excited to learn about!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-238">Understanding perspective rulers</h1>
<p class="normal">In this section, we<a id="_idIndexMarker1029"/> are going to look into what perspective rulers are, then understand one-point, two-point, and three-point rulers by creating them with step-by-step tutorials, and finally, learn how to use the Linear and Figure tools with perspective rulers.</p>
<p class="normal">Perspective rulers are a game-changer for any digital artist that draws backgrounds. Creating detailed cityscapes and backgrounds is easier than ever with the digital perspective ruler. However, having perspective rulers at your disposal will not suddenly make you an expert in perspective if you’ve never studied it before. Just like a real ruler in the physical world, perspective rulers are a tool that can make the drawing process easier.</p>
<p class="normal">Having access to a tool like perspective rulers does not replace knowledge of and practice with drawing in perspective. If you don’t know the principles of drawing with depth, then these rulers can only aid you so much. You can find many good books explaining how to draw backgrounds in perspective.</p>
<p class="normal">Perspective rulers in Clip Studio Paint can be made as one-, two-, or three-vanishing point perspective rulers. You can also add other points as you get more comfortable with drawing in perspective, but for the purposes of this book, we’ll focus on one, two, and three points of perspective.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s start with the easiest perspective ruler to grasp, the one-point perspective ruler. For each of the following ruler instructions, you will need a canvas to draw on and a rough sketch of the scene in perspective to draw. This is where that knowledge of perspective comes in! I recommend you properly place the perspective<a id="_idIndexMarker1030"/> vanishing points when you create a rough sketch of the scene.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-239">One-point perspective</h2>
<p class="normal">As mentioned, we will<a id="_idIndexMarker1031"/> start with a canvas with <a id="_idIndexMarker1032"/>a rough sketch on it. For the one-point perspective, we are going to draw some buildings and a road going into the distance. For ideas, work from any references you have if you need to!</p>
<p class="normal">The following screenshot shows the sketch I will be basing my perspective ruler on. Having a rough sketch available makes it much easier to place the vanishing points and guidelines:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_13_13.26.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.26: A rough sketch of a background</p>
<p class="normal">Now that the rough sketch is done, we can follow these steps to make the one-point perspective ruler:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">In the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu, click on <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong>, go to <strong class="screenText">Ruler/Frame</strong>, and then click on <strong class="screenText">Create Perspective Ruler</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal-one">A box will appear as shown in Figure 13.27.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_13_13.27.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.27: Screenshot of the Create Perspective Ruler window</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="2">Select <strong class="screenText">1-point perspective</strong> from <strong class="screenText">Type</strong>. Activating <strong class="screenText">Fisheye perspective</strong> will distort the ruler into a<a id="_idIndexMarker1033"/> Fisheye shape, but we won’t use <a id="_idIndexMarker1034"/>this function for now. Leaving the <strong class="screenText">Create new layer</strong> box unchecked will create the ruler on the currently active layer. Since we want to create a layer to refine our rough sketch above the rough sketch layer, we will leave the <strong class="screenText">Create new layer</strong> box checked.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on <strong class="screenText">OK</strong> to create the new ruler.</li>
<li class="numberedList">When the ruler is created on the canvas, the currently active tool will automatically switch to the <strong class="screenText">Object</strong> sub tool. This will allow us to adjust our perspective ruler on the canvas.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">Figure 13.28 is a screenshot of the perspective ruler without the rough sketch behind it, allowing it to be clearly seen. The line across the canvas from left to right is our horizon line. The two blue dots on either side of the line allow us to control the tilt of the horizon line. The circular point on the horizon line is the vanishing point for our perspective. </p>
<p class="normal">The two lines radiating out from the vanishing point are guidelines that will help us place our perspective ruler in the correct spot.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_13_13.28.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.28: Screenshot of the one-point perspective ruler guidelines</p>
<p class="normal">Using the <strong class="screenText">Object</strong> sub <a id="_idIndexMarker1035"/>tool, click on the vanishing<a id="_idIndexMarker1036"/> point and drag it so that it is in the same place as the vanishing point on the rough sketch. Ensure that the horizon line of the perspective ruler also matches the horizon on the rough sketch. The handles of the guidelines can be used to check the perspective and ensure that the ruler is in the correct position. Figure 13.29 shows the perspective ruler in the correct position.</p>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.29: Screenshot of one-point perspective ruler guidelines on a sketch</p>
<p class="normal">Now that the perspective ruler is in position, we will ensure that the <strong class="screenText">Snap to Special Ruler</strong> icon in the main command bar is active. We can now draw in our cleaned-up scene, and the drawing tools will snap to the lines of the ruler. Figure 13.30 shows the<a id="_idIndexMarker1037"/> finished pencils for this<a id="_idIndexMarker1038"/> perspective scene:</p>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.30: A sketch guided by the one-point perspective ruler</p>
<p class="normal">Once the scene is sketched out, we can add another layer on top of the sketch layer to ink on and still be able to see and snap tools to our perspective ruler. In order to do this, look in the <strong class="screenText">Layer</strong> palette. With the ruler layer selected, click on the <strong class="screenText">Set showing area of ruler</strong> icon to open the dropdown, which you can see in the following screenshot as a triangular ruler shape, just above the drop-down menu:</p>

<p class="normal">Set the <strong class="screenText">Show in All Layers</strong> option<a id="_idIndexMarker1039"/> to see and use the<a id="_idIndexMarker1040"/> perspective ruler no matter what layer is currently active.</p>
<p class="normal">The showing areas for the rulers are <strong class="screenText">Show in All Layers</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Show in Same Folder</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Show Only When Editing Target</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Link guide to ruler</strong>. Descriptions for each of these options are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">When a ruler layer is set to <strong class="screenText">Show in All Layers</strong>, the ruler will appear and be able to be snapped to any layer in the current canvas.</li>
<li class="bulletList">When set to <strong class="screenText">Show in Same Folder</strong>, the ruler will be shown only when it is on layers that are in the same layer folder as the ruler. (For instance, if our canvas includes a folder labeled <strong class="screenText">Sketches</strong> that has a ruler in it, the ruler will only be visible and usable when on layers grouped in that same folder.)</li>
<li class="bulletList">When set to <strong class="screenText">Show Only When Editing Target</strong>, the ruler will only be shown when the ruler layer is the currently active layer.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Link guide to ruler</strong> links the ruler and guide created on the same layer. When turned on, rulers and guides can be moved together with the <strong class="screenText">Move layer</strong> tool.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Now, let’s have <a id="_idIndexMarker1041"/>a look at a perspective ruler<a id="_idIndexMarker1042"/> with more vanishing points in the next section.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-240">Two-point perspective</h2>
<p class="normal">Creating <a id="_idIndexMarker1043"/>a two-point perspective ruler<a id="_idIndexMarker1044"/> can be achieved with the same method as shown in the <em class="italic">One-point perspective</em> section of this chapter. However, additional perspective vanishing points can also be added to an existing ruler. The following screenshot shows a sketch created with a two-point perspective ruler. Note that the two vanishing points are often far away from each other and out of the frame, as their being too close will distort the objects we draw:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A drawing of a building  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_13_13.32.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.32: Screenshot of the two-point perspective sample art</p>
<p class="normal">To create a basic two-point ruler, follow the instructions in the preceding section but select the <strong class="screenText">2 points perspective</strong> option from the dialog box in <em class="italic">step 2</em>. To add a point to an existing ruler, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Click on the existing ruler with the <strong class="screenText">Object</strong> sub tool to select it. If a ruler is currently selected, the control handles will be visible.</li>

<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="3">On the canvas, click where you want to add a new vanishing point.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">As you can see from the screenshot in <em class="italic">FIgure 13.33</em>, the perspective ruler <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette has several options in the <strong class="screenText">Process</strong> drop-down menu that can assist us with drawing perspective rulers. We have already covered the <strong class="screenText">Add vanishing point</strong> option, and the following list describes the rest of the perspective ruler tools available in this palette:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Delete vanishing point</strong> will delete the currently selected vanishing point.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Add guide</strong> will create a new guide coming from the current vanishing point.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Delete guide</strong> will delete the selected guide from the vanishing point.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Fix vanishing point</strong> locks the selected vanishing point to its current position.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Infinitize</strong> moves the vanishing point to infinity when selected.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Now, you can<a id="_idIndexMarker1047"/> create multiple vanishing <a id="_idIndexMarker1048"/>point perspective rulers. Let’s look into how to create a three-point perspective drawing with a perspective ruler.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-241">Three-point perspective</h2>
<p class="normal">Once you have <a id="_idIndexMarker1049"/>mastered one- and two-point<a id="_idIndexMarker1050"/> perspectives, you can start creating some very cool scenes using three-point perspective. Scenes created in three-point perspective look flashy and cool and really add a feeling of three-dimensional space to your comic scenes. Figure 13.34 shows an example of a three-point perspective cityscape from my work.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_13_13.34.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.34: Background drawing by using a perspective ruler</p>
<p class="normal">By zooming out, we<a id="_idIndexMarker1051"/> can see how the <a id="_idIndexMarker1052"/>perspective ruler was set up to create this bird’s-eye view of a city. As with two-point perspective, vanishing points shouldn’t be too close, as they can distort the objects we draw, so it is worth remembering that they should be placed far apart. Figure 13.35 shows a zoomed-out view of the page with the perspective ruler showing. Note how far away the vanishing points are from the edges of the canvas.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_13_13.35.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.35: Background drawing with vanishing points</p>
<p class="normal">Three-point perspective rulers can be created by using either method described in the one-point and two-point perspective sections of this chapter. However, they are trickier to work with, since there are so many points that the program tries to snap to. Sometimes, the program may pick up on the wrong guideline, and you may have to undo your line and try again.</p>
<p class="normal">Once you master three-point perspective rulers, they are an invaluable part of drawing really cool environments for your characters to inhabit, especially a scene where a camera looks up at a big building, or a bird’s-eye view of a town, just like in the preceding sample art. It is like creating scenes with a drone camera, looking at the world freely from low on the ground or high in the air!</p>
<p class="normal">Before we move<a id="_idIndexMarker1053"/> on from perspective <a id="_idIndexMarker1054"/>rulers, did you know that you can draw perfect ellipses and other shapes with them? Let’s learn more in the next section!</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-242">Using figure and line tools with perspective rulers</h2>
<p class="normal">Did you know that <a id="_idIndexMarker1055"/>you can use shape and line tools with perspective rulers? Follow these steps to use the <strong class="screenText">Direct Draw</strong> sub tools with perspective rulers:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Using one of the methods listed previously in this chapter, create a perspective ruler on your canvas.</li>

<p class="normal">By configuring the settings on shape tools, you can considerably speed up your object drawing.</p>
<p class="normal">There are ways <a id="_idIndexMarker1057"/>to control multiple rulers to organize your canvas; let’s find out how in the next section.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-243">Making rulers inactive</h1>
<p class="normal">In some instances, you <a id="_idIndexMarker1058"/>may find it necessary to have multiple rulers in the same image. This can become confusing for the program, and for us as well! So in this section, we will examine the quick process of making rulers and vanishing points active or inactive. This will allow us to control how rulers work and what areas of a ruler are active at any time.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-244">Turning rulers off and on with the control handle</h2>
<p class="normal">Making a ruler<a id="_idIndexMarker1059"/> active or inactive is simple but invaluable. Knowing how to manage multiple rulers can mean the difference between a smooth drawing experience and hours of frustration fighting with your tools! Follow these steps to make an active ruler inactive:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Create a ruler on a new canvas. In this example, we will look at a concentric circle ruler, but just about any ruler tool will do.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on the ruler with the <strong class="screenText">Object</strong> sub tool if the ruler is not already selected. The currently selected ruler will show the control handles. In Figure 13.37, the control handles are the circular and diamond-shaped icons around the ruler that allow us to edit it and change its shape and rotation.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_13_13.37.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.37: Screenshot of the perspective ruler and figure ruler guidelines</p>
<p class="normal">Locate the control handle shaped like a diamond. In the preceding screenshot, it is located just to <a id="_idIndexMarker1060"/>the right of the center of the circle ruler. Click on the diamond-shaped control handle to make the ruler inactive. The ruler will change colors from purple to green, as shown in Figure 13.38.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_13_13.38.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.38: Screenshot with one of the rulers inactive</p>
<p class="normal">To make the ruler active again, click on the circle with a slash icon. The ruler will change back to its active color and be able to be snapped to.</p>
<p class="normal">This method can <a id="_idIndexMarker1061"/>also be applied to individual vanishing points along a perspective ruler. In Figure 13.39 showing the Fisheye perspective ruler, all upper vanishing points have been made inactive so that tools will only snap to the center vanishing point.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_13_13.39.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.39: Screenshot of only one active ruler</p>
<p class="normal">Now that we’ve learned about all these specialty rulers, let’s cover an often-overlooked tool <a id="_idIndexMarker1062"/>that can save you from a headache and also save a lot of time if you know how to use it.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-245">Using grids and guides</h1>
<p class="normal">Many new users of Clip<a id="_idIndexMarker1063"/> Studio Paint don’t know that the software comes with a customizable grid that can be shown or hidden, or that you can create guides in the program as well. Grids and guidelines are handy for many tasks, of course, and provide a visual measurement that is easy to count and divide. Also, the grids and guidelines in Clip Studio Paint can be snapped to, making it very easy to get elements lined up precisely as they need to be.</p>
<p class="normal">In this section, we will learn how to show and hide the grid and how to make guidelines.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-246">Showing and hiding the grid</h2>
<p class="normal">To see the<a id="_idIndexMarker1064"/> grid in action, let’s look at the following screenshot:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_13_13.40.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 13.40: Screenshot of the canvas with a grid</p>
<p class="normal">Looking closely, we can see that some of the lines are darker. These darker lines are our grid lines. Between each grid line are three grid-dividing lines that break each larger square of the grid up into four sections in each direction, giving a total of 16 squares between each line of the grid.</p>
<p class="normal">Follow these steps to show the grid on your own work:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">In the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu, or on the top menu bar on a Mac, click on the <strong class="screenText">View</strong> option.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on <strong class="screenText">Grid</strong> to show the grid.</li>
<li class="numberedList">To hide a visible grid, click on <strong class="screenText">View</strong>, and then click <strong class="screenText">Grid</strong> again to uncheck the option.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">The grid is also adjustable by changing its settings; read on to find out how!</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-247">Adjusting grid settings</h2>
<p class="normal">There are grid <a id="_idIndexMarker1065"/>settings that allow us to change grid divisions. These settings are accessible by clicking on <strong class="screenText">View</strong> in the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu and then clicking on <strong class="screenText">Grid/Ruler bar settings…</strong>. The grid/ruler settings menu is shown in the following screenshot:</p>

<p class="normal">Under <strong class="screenText">Start point of grid/ruler bar</strong>, the point of origin of the grid can be set. By default, it is set to the top left, meaning that the grid will appear with its start point in the top-left corner of the canvas. The other options for the point of origin are <strong class="screenText">Top right</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Center</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Bottom left</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Bottom right</strong>. There is also an option to set a <strong class="screenText">Custom</strong> point of origin. Clicking the radio button next to the <strong class="screenText">Custom</strong> option will activate the text entry box, and custom values for the number of offset pixels for both the width and height of the document can be set. For instance, if a value of <strong class="screenText">10</strong> is entered in <strong class="screenText">W</strong> and a value of <strong class="screenText">20</strong> in the <strong class="screenText">H</strong> setting, then the point of origin for the grid will be 10 pixels in from the left side and 20 pixels down.</p>
<p class="normal">Under <strong class="screenText">Grid settings</strong>, the <strong class="screenText">Gap</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Number of divisions</strong> options can be set. <strong class="screenText">Gap</strong> is the space between the grid lines, which is set to <strong class="screenText">100</strong> pixels in the preceding screenshot. <strong class="screenText">Number of divisions</strong> is the setting for how many times the larger grid lines should be divided. Setting this to a higher number will result in smaller squares occurring <a id="_idIndexMarker1066"/>in the grid overall because of the additional divisions.</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s look at another ruler that is easy enough to use for your creation.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-248">Making guides</h2>
<p class="normal">Guide rulers are simple<a id="_idIndexMarker1067"/> to use, but their applications are endless. They can be used in combination with a grid to mark the margins of a document, to find the center of a canvas, or to align design elements such as different layers of text and illustrations.</p>
<p class="normal">Guides work like the line ruler sub tool, but they can only go straight horizontally or vertically on the canvas. Follow these steps to make guidelines on your canvas:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Click on the <strong class="screenText">Ruler</strong> sub tool in the toolbar.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on the <strong class="screenText">Guide</strong> sub tool.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on the canvas and drag either horizontally or vertically, depending on which direction you want your guide to go in.</li>
<li class="numberedList">When the mouse button or stylus is released, the guide will be made.</li>
</ol>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Guides automatically continue all the way across and beyond the constraints of the canvas, no matter the length of the line that was dragged to create them.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Grids and guides are really easy to use, so it’s great to know that these rulers are available whenever<a id="_idIndexMarker1068"/> you need them to draw straight lines!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-249">Summary</h1>
<p class="normal">Wow, that was a lot of information about rulers! I hope that you learned some great new tips and tricks that will help you with your digital art creation in the future.</p>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we learned how to work with the basic rulers of Clip Studio Paint, as well as the radial, parallel, and symmetry rulers. We created one-point, two-point, and three-point perspective rulers and learned how to use the direct drawing tools with them. We learned how to make rulers active or inactive and how to use the snapping settings. Finally, we learned about grids and guides. In this chapter, you gained skills such as creating various rulers by yourself; manipulating and using perspective rulers, and using them with Figure tools; and using grids and guides, organized per your requirements. Background drawings won’t scare you anymore now that you know about rulers.</p>
<p class="normal">In the next chapter, we’re going to enter a new dimension: the third dimension! Keep reading to learn more about how to use 3D figures and objects in Clip Studio Paint.</p>
