<p class="mce-root">Serverless is a buzzword created to identify cloud services that are totally managed by the provider and have a different billing model where you pay only for the time that you use them, measured in a granularity of tenths of a second and not hours. Serverless Computing allows a wide range of applications to benefit from reduced costs, faster development, and much less trouble with availability and scalability. Those are enough reasons for you to start learning how to build serverless applications.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Besides teaching you what is and how to use serverless, this book offers a broader view on the subject. Serverless is frequently associated with FaaS and people don't realize that you can do much more with serverless than just running functions on demand. Serverless offers many services for databases, security, notifications, and others. I will teach you how to use them.</p>
<p class="mce-root">This book can be divided into the following three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li class="mce-root"><strong>Introduction</strong>: This is where you will be introduced to the serverless concepts and tools that will be used in this book. You will learn about AWS services and the Serverless Framework. This introduction ranges from <a href="">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Understanding the Serverless Model</em>, to <a href="436e582c-0a4c-4257-b8eb-aa2c1dbd98c4.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Using the Serverless Model</em>.</li>
<li class="mce-root"><strong>Building a serverless application</strong>: From <a href="274d8aba-8e7e-4c5e-b55b-a8e1797d3057.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Hosting the Website</em>, to <a href="cb2f92df-5bc3-4c8e-8872-fbee58e5b0be.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Managing a Serverless Database</em>, you will follow how to develop and host a serverless application and build the frontend, backend, and data access layer.</li>
<li class="mce-root"><strong>Advanced features</strong>: This book ends with <a href="5778526b-7b49-48bd-8fc8-f5285baa64c1.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Securing the Serverless Application</em>, to <a href="3c6f35a1-ca69-49db-ba87-f9b37af86ced.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Testing, Deploying, and Monitoring</em>, giving you the knowledge of how to use serverless to implement security and real-time notifications in addition to how to test, deploy, and monitor your application.</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">What this book covers</h1>

<p><a href="3c6f35a1-ca69-49db-ba87-f9b37af86ced.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Testing, Deploying, and Monitoring</em>, shows how to test a serverless solution, what are the standard practices to deploy your application in production, and what you need to monitor.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">What you need for this book</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This book assumes previous knowledge of web development using JavaScript and Node.js. While you have many options of programming languages to develop a serverless application, all code examples of this book uses Node, so some basic knowledge of Node.js is necessary at least to understand how npm and the JavaScript ES6 syntax are used.</p>
<p>There are many cloud providers that offer serverless services, but this book focuses on AWS. You don't need to have prior knowledge of AWS because we will cover the basics too, but you will need to create an account to develop and test the code examples. If it is a brand new account, AWS offers a free tier of 12 months for you to learn and develop without any cost.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Who this book is for</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This book was designed for web developers who want to use cloud services to be more productive, reducing the time wasted on configuration and maintenance of the infrastructure or for developers who want to build solutions using existing services to solve common problems with very little effort.</p>
<p>Also, as I work as a full-stack developer, my job requires me to understand a little bit of everything such as frontend, backend, databases, security, and DevOps. So I tried to give in this book a broad view of web development using the serverless concept. If you have a similar role or, at least, want to learn more about the different layers of web development, this book will suit you well.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Conventions</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning.</p>
<p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "This example defines a <kbd>&lt;HelloReact/&gt;</kbd> HTML element and the rendered output will use the value of the <kbd>name</kbd> property".</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre class="mce-root">
     class HelloReact extends React.Component {<br/>       render() {<br/>         return &lt;div&gt;Hello, {this.props.name}!&lt;/div&gt;;<br/>       }<br/>     }<br/><br/>     ReactDOM.render(<br/>       &lt;HelloReact name="World"/&gt;,<br/>       document.getElementById('root')<br/>     );
</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>
    [default]<br/>    exten =&gt; s,1,Dial(Zap/1|30)<br/>    exten =&gt; s,2,Voicemail(u100)<br/>    <strong>exten =&gt; s,102,Voicemail(b100)</strong><br/>    exten =&gt; i,1,Voicemail(s0)
</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre>
<strong>aws s3 sync ./path/to/folder s3://my-bucket-name --acl public-read</strong>
</pre>
<p><strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important</strong> words are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "Clicking the Next button moves you to the next screen."</p>
<div><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p>
</div>
<div><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p>
</div>
