It is a <span class="strong"><strong>What You See Is What You Get</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>WYSIWYG</strong></span>) IDE that provides capabilities to implement an application using the visual editor and the built-in code editor. It also uses a drag-and-drop visual interface <a id="id1" class="indexterm"/>for rapid application development that targets both the desktop (Ext JS) and mobile devices (Sencha Touch). In this chapter, we will cover the basics of Sencha Architect. We will cover the following points:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Presenting Sencha Architect and its interface features</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Project basics</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The inspector</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The config panel</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The toolbox</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The design canvas</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Getting started"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec08"/>Getting started</h1></div></div></div><p>Sencha Architect is a great learning tool of the Sencha Touch and Ext JS framework libraries. Also, Sencha <a id="id2" class="indexterm"/>Architect is a great tool for rapid prototyping of applications, as well as rapid code-free starter and full application development. Sencha Architect works on two levels: as a prototyping tool as well as a code generation tool. Particularly for complex UIs, it saves hours of development time that are normally spent tweaking layouts and making sure that nested elements play well together. Best of all (and unlike most prototyping tools), it produces clean, object-oriented code that looks like the code you would have written yourself; and it was written completely in Ext JS.</p><p>Sencha Architect was released in 2010. Back in 2010, it was called Ext Designer, and it only had support for Ext JS applications (supported only Ext JS 3). Then, when Sencha released Ext JS 4.2, Ext Designer got an upgrade, and it was called Ext Designer 1.2, with support to develop Ext JS 3 and Ext JS 4 applications. In January 2012, Sencha announced Sencha <a id="id3" class="indexterm"/>Designer 2 beta, another upgrade from Ext Designer, but now, the tool also supported Sencha Touch 2 application development. In April 2012, Sencha decided to rename the tool as Sencha Architect 2, a complete tool to develop desktop applications with <a id="id4" class="indexterm"/>Ext JS 4 (it lost its support to Ext JS 3) and mobile applications with Sencha Touch 2.</p><p>So, this is why there is no Sencha Architect 1, because it was known as Ext Designer before becoming Sencha Architect! The most current version is 2.2.2 (as this book is being written).</p><p>Before we start getting hands-on, there are a few things <a id="id5" class="indexterm"/>you need to know:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Familiarity with coding HTML</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A basic background in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A strong <a id="id6" class="indexterm"/>background in JavaScript and a basic understanding of <span class="strong"><strong>JSON</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>JavaScript Object Notation</strong></span>)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Basic knowledge of Ext JS and Sencha Touch</li></ul></div><p>We will explore a lot of functionalities of Sencha Architect, and we will create some examples as well.

As Sencha Architect is a paid tool, you can download the 30-day trial at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.sencha.com/products/architect/download/">http://www.sencha.com/products/architect/download/</a> or you can buy a license at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.sencha.com/store/architect/">http://www.sencha.com/store/architect/</a>. Sencha Architect is available for Windows (<code class="literal">.exe</code>), Linux (<code class="literal">.run</code>), and Mac OS (<code class="literal">.dmg</code>) users. The installation process is very simple. <a id="id9" class="indexterm"/>You simply need to run the executable file and follow the wizard steps (administrator access is also required).</p><p>After the installation is complete, click on the<a id="id10" class="indexterm"/> Sencha Architect application to run it:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9819OS_01_16.jpg" alt="Presenting Sencha Architect"/></div><div class="section" title="Running Sencha Architect for the first time"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec06"/>Running Sencha Architect for the first time</h2></div></div></div><p>When you execute Sencha Architect <a id="id11" class="indexterm"/>for the first time, you can either enter your username and password (the same you used on the Sencha Forum for the 30-day trial) or activate the software with the license key that was sent to your e-mail when you completed the purchase on the Sencha website. Next, the <span class="strong"><strong>Welcome to Sencha Architect</strong></span> screen<a id="id12" class="indexterm"/> will be displayed as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9819OS_01_01.jpg" alt="Running Sencha Architect for the first time"/></div><p>On the left-hand side of the screen, we can find links to its documentation, <span class="strong"><strong>Changelog</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Sencha Architect Forum</strong></span>. Under <span class="strong"><strong>Open Recent Project</strong></span>, we can find the lists of the four most recent projects we have worked on and also a link to open an existing project. Below the list of existing<a id="id13" class="indexterm"/> projects, we can create a new blank project choosing one of the available frameworks.</p><p>Once we open Sencha Architect, a screen will be displayed as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9819OS_01_02.jpg" alt="Running Sencha Architect for the first time"/></div><p>As you can see in the preceding screenshot, Sencha Architect has seven major items that compose its interface:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The <a id="id14" class="indexterm"/>application toolbar<a id="id15" class="indexterm"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The online documents built into the software<a id="id16" class="indexterm"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The project inspector<a id="id17" class="indexterm"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The config panel<a id="id18" class="indexterm"/></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The <a id="id19" class="indexterm"/>canvas, composed by the design editor and code editor</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The<a id="id20" class="indexterm"/> toolbox</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The log<a id="id21" class="indexterm"/></li></ul></div><p>Let's dive into each one of the major items of the Sencha Architect interface.</p></div><div class="section" title="The toolbar"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec07"/>The toolbar</h2></div></div></div><p>The toolbar contains shortcuts to the most used functionalities of Sencha Architect, such as the creating a new <a id="id22" class="indexterm"/>project, open <a id="id23" class="indexterm"/>an existing project, save a project, build, publish (deploy), preview (opens the browser automatically to preview the application), and edit project settings.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9819OS_01_03.jpg" alt="The toolbar"/></div><p>It is also possible to hide this toolbar.

You can also see all available components by selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Everything</strong></span>. If you need to find a particular component, you can also use the search field to filter the components.</p><p>The toolbox component<a id="id29" class="indexterm"/> will set changes depending on whether you are working on an Ext JS or a Sencha Touch project, as seen in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9819OS_01_05.jpg" alt="The toolbox"/></div><p>By default, the toolbox is located on the left-hand side of Sencha Architect, and on the right-hand side we have the project inspector and the config panel. It is possible to switch the toolbox to the right-hand side, and this way on the left-hand side we will have the project inspector (this can be interesting if we work on a big project), and the toolbox and config panel will be on the <a id="id30" class="indexterm"/>right-hand side. To do it, go back to the project <span class="strong"><strong>Settings</strong></span> and select the side you prefer.</p></div><div class="section" title="The config panel"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec09"/>The config panel</h2></div></div></div><p>Throughout this book, you will notice that with Sencha Architect, the amount of code you will have to write yourself is very little. Basically, we will only code functions or a brand new class. All the <a id="id31" class="indexterm"/>rest will<a id="id32" class="indexterm"/> be done using Sencha Architect capabilities. For this reason, the config panel is very important. The main use of the config panel is that we can see the attributes values for the classes we create so we can set a value or change an existing value.</p><p>The following screenshot shows the config <a id="id33" class="indexterm"/>panel and some of its features:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9819OS_01_06.jpg" alt="The config panel"/></div><p>In the config panel, there are a few things that can help us to improve our development tasks. For example, depending on the class you selected from the project inspector, the config panel displays the configuration properties for the selected class or component. This is very helpful, because we have access to all the attributes of that class, and we do not need to refer to the documentation all the time to see if the attribute we are looking for is there. Also, Sencha Architect displays only the attributes that are recommended by Sencha for best practices; for example, use <code class="literal">dockedItems</code> instead of <code class="literal">buttons</code> for the <code class="literal">Form</code> class (the config <code class="literal">buttons</code> is not displayed on Sencha Architect).</p><p>If you are not in the mood to scroll to see all the configurations of a particular class, you can easily use the<a id="id34" class="indexterm"/> filter to search for a particular configuration (<span class="emphasis"><em>3</em></span>). By clicking on the lock icon <a id="id35" class="indexterm"/>(<span class="emphasis"><em>4</em></span>), you can lock the filter, and when you select another class from the project inspector, the filter will be automatically applied. In case you want to remove the filter, just close the panel.</p><p>See the<a id="id36" class="indexterm"/> question mark icon (2)? When you hover your cursor over the question mark icon, you can read a brief description of the class, and if we want to read more about it, we can click on the link in the description box and go to the documentation. The same happens when we hover our cursor over a configuration of the class; the question mark icon will also be displayed with a brief description of the configuration, and we can also go to the online documentation to read more about it.</p><p>We can also see<a id="id37" class="indexterm"/> two icons on the side of the <span class="strong"><strong>Config</strong></span> label<a id="id38" class="indexterm"/> (<span class="emphasis"><em>1</em></span>). The first one (selected on the screenshot), will display the common configurations of the selected class. The second one will display advanced configurations, such as <code class="literal">alternateClassName</code> (used to maintain compatibility with older versions). Usually, we will only use the common configurations, but in case you need to use some advanced configurations, Sencha Architect also provides this option.</p><p>Now, let's say you want to use a configuration that is not listed on the config panel. Can we add it? The answer is yes. We can add configurations that do not exist in the config panel. To do it, go to the filter, type the name of the config, and click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Add</strong></span> button<a id="id39" class="indexterm"/> (<span class="emphasis"><em>5</em></span>). This new configuration will be listed under <span class="strong"><strong>(Custom Properties)</strong></span>. By clicking on <span class="strong"><strong>…</strong></span>, we can choose the type of the new config (<span class="emphasis"><em>6</em></span>—<span class="strong"><strong>Array</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Boolean</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Number</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Object</strong></span>, or <span class="strong"><strong>String</strong></span>), and then set its value according to the selected type.</p><p>Another nice feature from Sencha Architect: as this tool provides and generates the code according to Sencha best practices, when you try to set the value of a particular property, Sencha Architect will let you set the value according to the property's type. For example, if you need to set the <span class="strong"><strong>store</strong></span> property for a grid or a list, Sencha Architect will list the current stores already created (<span class="emphasis"><em>7</em></span>), so you can choose one from the list. And, in case you change the name of the <span class="strong"><strong>store</strong></span>, it will be changed automatically in the classes that use that <span class="strong"><strong>store</strong></span>. This helps us to make fewer mistakes on the code. Some editors that can be used depending on the configuration's type are <span class="emphasis"><em>boolean</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>array</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Class</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>string</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Template</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>options</em></span>, as demonstrated in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9819OS_01_07.jpg" alt="The config panel"/></div><p>In case a configuration is already in use by the class, it will be displayed in blue; (<span class="emphasis"><em>1</em></span>) in the previous screenshot. <a id="id40" class="indexterm"/>To remove this property from the class, we simply need to click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Property</strong></span> pane.</p><p>Some classes can be used as configurations by other classes. For example, an <code class="literal">Ext.panel.Grid</code> class can have one or more <code class="literal">Ext.grid.column.Column</code> classes (or its subclasses). We can navigate from a particular column of the grid to its configurations by clicking on the arrow icon as displayed in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9819OS_01_08.jpg" alt="The config panel"/></div></div><div class="section" title="The canvas"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec10"/>The canvas</h2></div></div></div><p>The canvas is <a id="id41" class="indexterm"/>where you can visually<a id="id42" class="indexterm"/> create your application, and you can also edit its code.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip02"/>Tip</h3><p>You can also drag-and-drop toolbox components into the design canvas as well as the project inspector, which is especially useful when the design canvas gets busy with many components.</p></div></div><p>The canvas has two tabs: the <a id="id43" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Design</strong></span> tab, which is the visual editor, or the <span class="strong"><strong>Code</strong></span> editor tab. Let's take a deeper look into them.</p><div class="section" title="The visual editor"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec01"/>The visual editor</h3></div></div></div><p>The visual editor provides a visual representation of the application. Right here, you can see how your application or a particular component will look without having to execute the application on<a id="id44" class="indexterm"/> the browser. There is also the <span class="strong"><strong>Refresh</strong></span> button<a id="id45" class="indexterm"/>, in case you have made a change and want to refresh the visual editor to see how it looks. You can also navigate between the <span class="strong"><strong>Design</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Code</strong></span> editor tabs.</p><p>The <a id="id46" class="indexterm"/>visual editor is a little bit different for Ext JS and Sencha Touch projects. The following screenshot is from an Ext JS project:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9819OS_01_09.jpg" alt="The visual editor"/></div><p>At the bottom, you can resize the visual editor (<span class="emphasis"><em>2</em></span>). This can be useful to see how the application will look in screens with different resolutions.</p><p>There is also the <a id="id47" class="indexterm"/>flyout config (<span class="emphasis"><em>1</em></span>), which can be useful to set layout configurations and other properties that affect the appearance of a component.</p><p>In the next screenshot, we can see the visual editor for a Sencha Touch project:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9819OS_01_10.jpg" alt="The visual editor"/></div><p>We can also edit the canvas size (<span class="emphasis"><em>1</em></span>), and as Sencha Touch is for mobile applications, we can choose a different <a id="id48" class="indexterm"/>device (<span class="strong"><strong>iPhone (320 x 480)</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>iPad (786 x 1023)</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Nexus S (480 x 800)</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>PlayBook/Kindle Fire (600 x…)</strong></span>) to see how the application will look on different devices. It is also possible to set a custom size. If we would like to see how the application looks on the device in different positions, we can set to see it horizontally (default option) or vertically (<span class="emphasis"><em>2</em></span>). It is also possible to set the zoom of the canvas (<span class="emphasis"><em>3</em></span>), and we can also ask Sencha Architect to fit the canvas (<span class="emphasis"><em>4</em></span>) according to the space we have available on our computer screen.</p></div><div class="section" title="The code editor"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl3sec02"/>The code editor</h3></div></div></div><p>Switching to the <span class="strong"><strong>Code</strong></span> tab<a id="id49" class="indexterm"/>, we can see the code generated for a particular component (<span class="emphasis"><em>1</em></span> in the following screenshot). If we try to directly change a <a id="id50" class="indexterm"/>particular property inside the code editor, we will notice that it is not possible unless it is a function. This is because most of the configuration will be done using the config panel. This can be a good thing, or it can be a bad thing as well. It is good because it maintains the code safe from unnecessary changes and it generates the code according to Sencha best practices. It can be bad, however, because it limits our power to edit the code; we need to get used to using the config panel. Overall, it is<a id="id51" class="indexterm"/> good that Sencha Architect has this behaviour. For developers that are used to writing all the code by themselves, it is simply a matter of getting used to this new way of coding:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9819OS_01_11.jpg" alt="The code editor"/></div><p>In the previous screenshot, at the top, you can easily navigate through different classes you have opened or created (<span class="emphasis"><em>2</em></span>), and you can also open a particular tab from the list of tabs that are currently open (<span class="emphasis"><em>6</em></span>).</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note02"/>Note</h3><p>If you don't want to persist the tabs of classes you are working on, you can easily disable this option by going back to <span class="strong"><strong>Settings</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Applications</strong></span> and selecting <span class="strong"><strong>Disable</strong></span> for the <span class="strong"><strong>Persist tabs currently open with each project save</strong></span> option.</p></div></div><p>We can also navigate through the code of a particular component (<span class="emphasis"><em>3</em></span>). The available items we can navigate through are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Generated Class</strong></span>, which is a read only version of the generated code</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Generated JSON</strong></span>, which is also a read only version of the JSON code generated of the class (it is the configuration we can pass to the class if we use <code class="literal">Ext.create</code> to instantiate it)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The overrides class in case we override the current class (<span class="emphasis"><em>4</em></span>—we will learn more about overrides later in the book)</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The editable code item such as event bindings, controller actions, functions, and templates</li></ul></div><p>Sencha Architect also allows us to save the current code displayed on the code editor on a separate file using the export to disk icon (<span class="emphasis"><em>5</em></span>); it is also possible to copy the code to the clipboard.</p><p>If we hover the<a id="id52" class="indexterm"/> mouse over certain parts of the code (<span class="emphasis"><em>7</em></span>—the editable ones such as functions and templates), we will see that an edit icon will appear. If we click on it, the code will be available for editing, as demonstrated in the following screenshot:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9819OS_01_12.jpg" alt="The code editor"/></div><p>If the JSHint validation is enabled (<span class="strong"><strong>Settings</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Application</strong></span> to enable or disable it), we will be able to see warnings or errors if there are any in our code (<span class="strong"><strong>Missing semicolon</strong></span> on line <code class="literal">20</code> in the previous screenshot).</p><p>Sencha Architect also provides the <span class="strong"><strong>Find</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>Replace</strong></span> features. By clicking <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>F</em></span>
<a id="id53" class="indexterm"/> (or <span class="emphasis"><em>cmd</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>F</em></span> on Mac OS), we can search for a particular string on the code. By clicking <span class="emphasis"><em>Ctrl</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>H</em></span>
<a id="id54" class="indexterm"/> (<span class="emphasis"><em>cmd</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>Alt</em></span> + <span class="emphasis"><em>F</em></span> on Mac OS), we can enable the <span class="strong"><strong>Replace</strong></span> feature as demonstrated in the preceding screenshot.</p><p>Although Sencha Architect generates most of the code for us, on the editable pieces, there is no autocomplete feature available yet (Sencha Architect 2.2), so we must code without the assistance of intelli-sense (or code completion).</p></div></div><div class="section" title="The project inspector"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec11"/>The project inspector</h2></div></div></div><p>On the project inspector,<a id="id55" class="indexterm"/> we can <a id="id56" class="indexterm"/>see the structure of our project, including all the <span class="strong"><strong>Controllers</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Stores</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Views</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Models</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>Resources</strong></span> we created for a particular project. If we expand a class, we will be able to see its inner components and functions. For big projects, it is easy to find a particular <a id="id57" class="indexterm"/>class by using the <span class="strong"><strong>Quick Open…</strong></span> feature. By clicking on the plus icon, we can quickly create a new <span class="strong"><strong>Controller</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Store</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Model</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Resource</strong></span>, or a brand new <span class="strong"><strong>Class</strong></span>:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9819OS_01_13.jpg" alt="The project inspector"/></div><p>Sencha Architect also provides some options once we have created a class. For example, let's say we created a viewport, but that was not what we really needed; we need to create a panel instead of a viewport. By right-clicking on the class we created, we can transform it into something else; this way, there is no need to delete the current class and do all the existing code again. Let's use another example: if we need to create a grid panel and we instead set a store, by right-clicking on it, we can automatically generate all the columns based on the model or fields from the store by choosing the <span class="strong"><strong>Auto columns</strong></span> option. On the store, if we have a URL set for the proxy to load the data, we can chose the option <span class="strong"><strong>Load Data</strong></span> and look at what the server has sent back as data. Other options are available: <span class="strong"><strong>Export to File…</strong></span>, where we can export the current class to an external file, and another developer can import to Sencha Architect; <a id="id58" class="indexterm"/>
<span class="strong"><strong>Mark as Initial View</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Unmark as Initial View</strong></span>, where we can set which component will be the initial view of our application; and <span class="strong"><strong>Duplicate</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>Delete</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Save to Toolbox</strong></span> (saves the component on the toolbox for reuse):</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/9819OS_01_14.jpg" alt="The project inspector"/></div><p>We will learn more <a id="id59" class="indexterm"/>about some of these options throughout this book.</p></div><div class="section" title="Online documentation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec12"/>Online documentation</h2></div></div></div><p>By clicking on the online documentation icon in the upper-right corner, Sencha Architect will open its online<a id="id60" class="indexterm"/> documentation on your default browser.

<div class="section" title="Preparing the environment"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec10"/>Preparing the environment</h1></div></div></div><p>Before we go to the next chapter, let's have our environment ready so we can create our first project with Sencha Architect.</p><p>We will need a web <a id="id63" class="indexterm"/>server to execute our projects. In this book, we will use XAMPP (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html">http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html</a>) as the default web server. You can use any web server you already have installed on your computer as well (IIS, Apache HTTP, and so on).</p><p>In the following links, you will <a id="id64" class="indexterm"/>find a brief tutorial on how to install XAMPP if you do not have it yet:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><a id="id65" class="indexterm"/><span class="strong"><strong>Mac OS</strong></span>: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-macosx.html">http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-macosx.html</a></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Windows</strong></span><a id="id66" class="indexterm"/>: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html">http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html</a></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><span class="strong"><strong>Linux</strong></span>: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html">http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html</a><a id="id67" class="indexterm"/></li></ul></div><p>Inside the XAMPP <code class="literal">htdocs</code> directory (or the <code class="literal">public</code> directory of your web server), create a new folder called <code class="literal">sencha-architect</code>.

<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec11"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, we learned about the basics of Sencha Architect and some of its interface features, such as the toolbar, toolbox, config panel, visual editor, code editor, online documentation, and project inspector. As this was our first contact with Sencha Architect, this chapter was an introduction. We will learn more about these items throughout this book.</p><p>We have also learned how to prepare our environment, so we can start creating our first Ext JS project in the next chapter.</p></div></body></html>
