    its concepts, and its ecosystem to the fullest. This includes everything you need
    to know about module systems, packages, helper libraries, CLI tools, WebAssembly,
    and a range of available tools such as bundlers (Webpack (v5), Parcel (v2), Vite,
    and esbuild), test runners (AVA, Jest, and Mocha), transpilers (Babel and TypeScript),
    and many more tools (Flow, Prettier, eslint, and Stylelint) are also covered.

    all work similarly and only require knowledge in core frontend technologies such
    as JavaScript with HTML and CSS. Additionally, some basic knowledge in using a
    terminal is necessary in order to follow all examples. The tooling to make the
    code run is discussed throughout the book. As such, if you know how to work with
    JavaScript, and follow the book explaining how to use Node.js with npm, you’ll
    have no problems running the examples presented in the book.
