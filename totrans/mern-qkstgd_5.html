<p>Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It allows developers to manage the state of their applications with ease. With Redux, the state is immutable. Thus, it is possible to go back and forth to the next or previous state of your application. Redux is bound to three core principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single source of truth</strong>: All the state of your application must be stored in a single object tree within one single store</li>
<li><strong>State is read-only</strong>: You must not mutate the state tree. Only by dispatching an action can the state tree change</li>
<li><strong>Changes are made with pure functions</strong>: These are called reducers, which are functions that accept the previous state and an action and compute a new state. Reducers must never mutate the previous state but rather always return a new one</li>
</ul>
<p>Reducers work in a very similar way to how the <kbd>Array.prototype.reduce</kbd> function does. The <kbd>reduce</kbd> method executes a function for every item in an array against an accumulator to reduce it to a single value. For example:</p>
<pre>const a = 5 
const b = 10 
const c = [a, b].reduce((accumulator, value) =&gt; { 
    return accumulator + value 
}, 0) </pre>
<p>The resulting value in variable <kbd>c</kbd> while reducing <kbd>a</kbd> and <kbd>b</kbd> against the <kbd>accumulator</kbd>, is <kbd>15</kbd> and the initial value is <kbd>0</kbd>. The reducer function here is:</p>
<pre>(accumulator, value) =&gt; { 
    return accumulator + value 
} </pre>
<p>Redux reducers are written in a similar way and they are the most important concept of Redux. For example:</p>
<pre>const reducer = (prevState, action) =&gt; newState </pre>
<p>In this chapter, we will focus on learning how to manage simple and complex state trees with Redux. You will learn as well how to deal with asynchronous data flows.</p>

<p>Reducers accept an <kbd>action</kbd> object that describes the action that is going to be performed and decides how to transform the state based on this <kbd>action</kbd> object.</p>
<p>Actions are just plain objects and they have only one required property that needs to be present, the action-type. For instance:</p>
<pre>const action = { 
    type: 'INCREMENT_COUNTER', 
} </pre>
<p>We can also provide additional properties as well. For instance:</p>
<pre>const action = { 
    type: 'INCREMENT_COUNTER', 
    incrementBy: 2, 
} </pre>
<p>Actions creators are just functions that return actions, for instance:</p>
<pre>const increment = (incrementBy) =&gt; ({ 
    type: 'INCREMENT_COUNTER', 
    incrementBy, 
}) </pre>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Redux reducers are pure functions. That means, they have no side-effects. Given the same arguments, the reducer must always generate the same shape of state. Take for example the following reducer function:</p>
<pre>const reducer = (prevState, action) =&gt; { 
    if (action.type === 'INC') { 
        return { counter: prevState.counter + 1 } 
    } 
    return prevState 
} </pre>
<p>If we execute this function providing the same arguments, the result will always be the same:</p>
<pre>const a = reducer( 
   { counter: 0 }, 
   { type: 'INC' }, 
) // Value is { counter: 1 }  
const b = reducer( 
   { counter: 0 }, 
   { type: 'INC' }, 
) // Value is { counter: 1 } </pre>
<div class="packt_infobox">However, take into account that even though the returned values have the same shape, these are two different objects. For instance, comparing the above:<br/>
<kbd>console.log(a === b)</kbd> returns false.</div>
<p>Impure reducer functions prevent your application state from being predictable and make difficult to reproduce the same state. For instance:</p>
<pre>const impureReducer = (prevState = {}, action) =&gt; { 
    if (action.type === 'SET_TIME') { 
        return { time: new Date().toString() } 
    } 
    return prevState 
} </pre>
<p>If we execute this function:</p>
<pre>const a = impureReducer({}, { type: 'SET_TIME' }) 
setTimeout(() =&gt; { 
    const b = impureReducer({}, { type: 'SET_TIME' }) 
    console.log( 
        a, // Output may be: {time: "22:10:15 GMT+0000"} 
        b, // Output may be: {time: "22:10:17 GMT+0000"} 
    ) 
}, 2000) </pre>
<p>As you can see, after executing the function for a second time after 2 seconds, we get a different result. To make it pure, you can consider re-writing the previously impure reducer as:</p>
<pre>const timeReducer = (prevState = {}, action) =&gt; { 
    if (action.type === 'SET_TIME') { 
        return { time: action.time } 
    } 
    return prevState 
} </pre>
<p>Then, you can safely pass a time property inside your action to set the time:</p>
<pre>const currentTime = new Date().toTimeString() 
const a = timeReducer( 
   { time: null }, 
   { type: 'SET_TIME', time: currentTime }, 
) 
const b = timeReducer( 
   { time: null }, 
   { type: 'SET_TIME', time: currentTime }, 
) 
console.log(a.time === b.time) // true </pre>
<p>This approach makes your state predictable and the state is easy to reproduce. For instance, you could re-create a scenario of how your application will act if you pass the <kbd>time</kbd> property for any time in morning or afternoon.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>We can summarize our application like the following to understand how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Action types <kbd>SET_MEAL</kbd> and <kbd>SET_TIME</kbd> were defined.</li>
<li>Two action creators were defined:
<ol>
<li><kbd>setMeal</kbd> <span>which generates an action with the</span> <kbd>SET_MEAL</kbd> <span>action type and a</span> <kbd>kindOfMeal</kbd> <span>property with the provided argument</span></li>
<li><kbd>setTime</kbd> <span>which generates an action with the</span> <kbd>SET_TIME</kbd> <span>action type and a</span> <kbd>time</kbd> <span>property with the provided argument</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>A reducer function was defined:
<ol>
<li>For the action type <kbd>SET_MEAL</kbd><span>, computes a new state with a new</span> <kbd>kindOfMeal</kbd> <span>property</span></li>
<li>For the action type <kbd>SET_TIME</kbd><span>, computes a new state with a new</span> <kbd>time</kbd> <span>property</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>We defined a function that will get called when the state tree changes. Inside the function, we updated the view according to the new state.</li>
<li>A <kbd>dispatch</kbd> function was defined that calls the reducer function providing the previous state and an action object to generate a new state.</li>
</ol>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Creating a Redux store</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>In the previous recipes, we have seen how to define reducers and actions. We have also seen how to create a dispatch function to dispatch actions for the reducers to update the state. The store is an object that provides a small API to put all of that together.</p>
<p>The redux module exposes the <kbd>createStore</kbd> method which we can use to create a store. It has the following signature:</p>
<pre>createStore(reducer, preloadedState, enhancer) </pre>
<p>The two last arguments are optional. For example, creating a store with a single reducer could look like this:</p>
<pre>const TYPE = { 
    INC_COUNTER: 'INC_COUNTER', 
    DEC_COUNTER: 'DEC_COUNTER', 
} 
const initialState = { 
    counter: 0, 
} 
const reducer = (state = initialState, action) =&gt; { 
    switch (action.type) { 
        case TYPE.INC_COUNTER:  
            return { counter: state.counter + 1 } 
        case TYPE.DEC_COUNTER:  
            return { counter: state.counter - 1 } 
        default:  
            return state 
    } 
} 
const store = createStore(reducer) </pre>
<p>Calling <kbd>createStore</kbd> will expose four methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>store.dispatch(action)</kbd>: Where action is an object that contains at least one property named <kbd>type</kbd> that specifies the action type</li>
<li><kbd>store.getState()</kbd>: Returns the whole state tree</li>
<li><kbd>store.subscribe(listener)</kbd>: Where listener is a callback function that will get triggered whenever the state tree changes. Several listeners can be subscribed</li>
<li><kbd>store.replaceReducer(reducer)</kbd>: Replaces the current Reducer function with a new one</li>
</ul>

<p>In this recipe, you will re-build the application that you built in the previous recipe. However, this time you will use Redux. Before you start, create a new <kbd>package.json</kbd> file with the following content:</p>
<pre>{ 
    "dependencies": { 
        "express": "4.16.3", 
        "redux": "4.0.0" 
    }

<p>Then, install the dependencies by opening a terminal and running:</p>
<pre><strong>npm install</strong>

<p>First, build a small ExpressJS server application whose sole purpose will be to serve an HTML file and the Redux module:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new file named <kbd>meal-time-server.js</kbd></li>
<li>Include the ExpressJS and <kbd>path</kbd> module and initialize a new ExpressJS Application:</li>
</ol>
<pre>      const express = require('express') 
      const path = require('path') 
      const app = express() </pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Serve the Redux library on <kbd>/lib</kbd> path. Make sure that the path points to the <kbd>node_modules</kbd> folder:</li>

<p>You can use the ES6 spread operator instead of <kbd>Object.assign</kbd> to merge your previous state with the next one, for instance, we re-wrote the reducer function of the previous recipe:</p>
<pre>const reducer = (prevState = initialState, action) =&gt; { 
    switch (action.type) { 
        case SET_MEAL: 
            return Object.assign({}, prevState, { 
                kindOfMeal: action.kindOfMeal, 
            }) 
        case SET_TIME: 
            return Object.assign({}, prevState, { 
                time: action.time, 
            }) 
        default: 
            return prevState 
    } 
} </pre>
<p>We rewrote it as the following:</p>
<pre>const reducer = (prevState = initialState, action) =&gt; { 
    switch (action.type) { 
        case SET_MEAL: 
            return {...prevState, 
                kindOfMeal: action.kindOfMeal, 
            } 
        case SET_TIME: 
            return {...prevState, 
                time: action.time, 
            } 
        default: 
            return prevState 
    } 
} </pre>
<p>This could make the code more readable.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Binding action creators to the dispatch method</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Actions creators are just functions that generate action objects which can later be used to dispatch actions using the <kbd>dispatch</kbd> method. Take for example the following code:</p>
<pre>const TYPES = { 
    ADD_ITEM: 'ADD_ITEM', 
    REMOVE_ITEM: 'REMOVE_ITEM', 
} 
const actions = { 
    addItem: (name, description) =&gt; ({ 
        type: TYPES.ADD_ITEM, 
        payload: { name, description }, 
    }), 
    removeItem: (id) =&gt; ({ 
        type: TYPES.REMOVE_ITEM, 
        payload: { id }, 
    }) 
} 
module.exports = actions </pre>
<p>Later, somewhere in your application, you can dispatch these actions using the <kbd>dispatch</kbd> method:</p>
<pre>dispatch(actions.addItem('Little Box', 'Cats')) 
dispatch(actions.removeItem(123)) </pre>
<p>However, as you can see, calling the <kbd>dispatch</kbd> method every time seems like a repeated and unnecessary step. You could simply wrap the action creators around the <kbd>dispatch</kbd> function itself like this:</p>
<pre>const actions = { 
    addItem: (name, description) =&gt; dispatch({ 
        type: TYPES.ADD_ITEM, 
        payload: { name, description }, 
    }), 
    removeItem: (id) =&gt; dispatch({ 
        type: TYPES.REMOVE_ITEM, 
        payload: { id }, 
    }) 
} 
module.exports = actions </pre>
<p>Even though this seems like a good solution, there is a problem. It means, you would need to create the store first, then define your action creators binding them to the <kbd>dispatch</kbd> method. In addition, it would be difficult to maintain the action creators in a separate file since they depend on the <kbd>dispatch</kbd> method to be present. There is a solution provided by the Redux module, a helper method called <kbd>bindActionCreators</kbd> which accepts two arguments. The first argument is an object with keys, which represent the name of an action creator, and values, which represent a function that returns an action. The second argument is expected to be the <kbd>dispatch</kbd> function:</p>
<pre>bindActionCreators(actionCreators, dispatchMethod) </pre>
<p>This helper method will map all the action creators to the dispatch method. For instance, we could re-write the previous example as the following:</p>
<pre>const store = createStore(reducer) 
const originalActions = require('./actions') 
const actions = bindActionCreators( 
    originalActions, 
    store.dispatch, 
) </pre>
<p>Then, later somewhere in your application, you can call these methods without wrapping them around the <kbd>dispatch</kbd> method:</p>
<pre>actions.addItem('Little Box', 'Cats') 
actions.removeItem(123) </pre>
<p>As you can see, our bound action creators look more like regular functions now. In fact, by destructuring the <kbd>actions</kbd> object, you can use only the methods you need. For instance:</p>
<pre>const { 
    addItem, 
    removeItem, 
} = bindActionCreators( 
    originalActions,  
    store.dispatch, 
) </pre>
<p>Then, you can call them like this:</p>
<pre>addItem('Little Box', 'Cats') 
removeItem(123) </pre>

<p>In this recipe, you will build a simple To-do application and you will use the concepts that you just have learned about binding action creators. First, create a new <kbd>package.json</kbd> file with the following content:</p>

    "dependencies": { 
        "express": "4.16.3", 
        "redux": "4.0.0" 
    }

<p>To build your To-do application, for the purpose of this recipe, define only one action creator and use <kbd>bindActionCreators</kbd> to bind it to the <kbd>dispatch</kbd> method.</p>
<p>First, build a small ExpressJS application that will serve the HTML file containing the To-do client application which we will build after:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new file named <kbd>bind-server.js</kbd></li>
<li>Add the following code:</li>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>As your application grows, you probably wouldn't want to write all the logic for how the state of your application needs to be transformed in a simple reducer function. What you would probably want is to write smaller reducers that specialize in managing independent parts of the state.</p>
<p>Take for example the following reducer function:</p>
<pre>const initialState = { 
    todoList: [], 
    chatMsg: [], 
} 
const reducer = (state = initialState, action) =&gt; { 
    switch (action.type) { 
        case 'ADD_TODO': return { 
            ...state, 
            todoList: [ 
                ...state.todoList, 
                { 
                    title: action.title, 
                    completed: action.completed, 
                }, 
            ], 
        } 
        case 'ADD_CHAT_MSG': return { 
            ...state, 
            chatMsg: [ 
                ...state.chatMsg, 
                { 
                    from: action.id, 
                    message: action.message, 
                }, 
            ], 
        } 
        default: 
            return state 
    } 
} </pre>
<p>You have two properties that manage the state of two different parts of an application. One manages the state of a Todo, list while the other manages the Chat messages. You could split this reducer into two reducer functions, where each manages one slice of the state, for instance:</p>
<pre>const initialState = { 
    todoList: [], 
    chatMsg: [], 
} 
const todoListReducer = (state = initialState.todoList, action) =&gt; { 
    switch (action.type) { 
        case 'ADD_TODO': return state.concat([ 
            { 
                title: action.title, 
                completed: action.completed, 
            }, 
        ]) 
        default: return state 
    } 
} 
const chatMsgReducer = (state = initialState.chatMsg, action) =&gt; { 
    switch (action.type) { 
        case 'ADD_CHAT_MSG': return state.concat([ 
            { 
                from: action.id, 
                message: action.message, 
            }, 
        ]) 
        default: return state 
    } 
} </pre>
<p>However, because <kbd>createStore</kbd> method accepts only one reducer as the first argument, you would need to combine them into a single reducer:</p>
<pre>const reducer = (state = initialState, action) =&gt; { 
    return { 
        todoList: todoListReducer(state.todoList, action), 
        chatMsg: chatMsgReducer(state.chatMsg, action), 
    } 
} </pre>
<p>In this way, we are able to split our reducers into smaller reducers that specialize in managing only one slice of the state, and later combine them together into a single reducer function.</p>
<p>Redux provides a helper method named <kbd>combineReducers</kbd> that allows you to combine reducers in a similar way to what we just did but without having to repeat a lot of code; for instance, we could rewrite the previous way of combining reducers like this:</p>
<pre>const reducer = combineReducers({ 
    todoList: todoListReducer, 
    chatMsg: chatMsgReducer, 
}) </pre>
<p>The <kbd>combineReducers</kbd> method is a <em>higher-order reducer</em> function. It accepts an object mapping specifies keys to a certain slice of the state managed by a specific <kbd>reducer</kbd> function and returns a new reducer function. If you run the following code, for instance:</p>
<pre>console.log(JSON.stringify( 
    reducer(initialState, { type: null }), 
    null, 2, 
)) </pre>
<p>You will see that the generated shape of the state looks like this:</p>
<pre>{ 
    "todoList": [], 
    "chatMsg": [], 
} </pre>
<p>We can try as well if our combined reducers are working and managing only the part of the state assigned to them. For instance:</p>
<pre>console.log(JSON.stringify( 
    reducer( 
        initialState, 
        { 
            type: 'ADD_TODO', 
            title: 'This is an example', 
            completed: false, 
        }, 
    ), 
    null, 2, 
)) </pre>
<p>The output should display the generated state as the following:</p>
<pre>{ 
    "todoList": [ 
        { 
            "title": "This is an example", 
            "completed": false, 
        }, 
    ], 
    "chatMsg": [], 
} </pre>
<p>This shows that each reducer is managing only the slice of the state assigned to them.</p>

<p>In this recipe, you will recreate the To-do application as in the pervious recipe. However, you will add other functionalities such as remove and toggle a To-do item. You will define other state of your application that will be managed by separate reducer functions. First, create a new <kbd>package.json</kbd> file with the following content:</p>
<pre>{ 
    "dependencies": { 
        "express": "4.16.3", 
        "redux": "4.0.0" 
    } 
} </pre>
<p>Then, install the dependencies by opening a Terminal and running:</p>
<pre><strong>npm install</strong></pre>

<p>First, build a small ExpressJS server application that will serve the client application and the Redux library installed in <kbd>node_modules</kbd>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new file named <kbd>todo-time.js</kbd></li>
<li>Add the following code:</li>

      const app = express() 
      app.use('/lib', express.static(

      )) 
      app.get('/', (req, res) =&gt; { 
          res.sendFile(path.join( 
              __dirname, 
              'todo-time.html', 
          ))

      app.listen(

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>A Redux store enhancer is a higher-order function that takes a store creator function and returns a new enhanced store creator function. The <kbd>createStore</kbd> method is a store creator which has the following signature:</p>
<pre>createStore = (reducer, preloadedState, enhancer) =&gt; Store </pre>
<p>While a store enhancer function has the following signature:</p>
<pre>enhancer = (...optionalArguments) =&gt; ( 
createStore =&gt; (reducer, preloadedState, enhancer) =&gt; Store 
) </pre>
<p>It may look a bit difficult to understand now, but you don't really have to worry if you don't get it at first because you will probably never need to write a store enhancer. The purpose of this recipe was simply to help you to understand their purpose in a very simple way.</p>

<p>In this recipe, you will create a store enhancer to expand the functionality of Redux by allowing the definition of reducer functions in a <kbd>Map</kbd> JavaScript native object. First, create a new <kbd>package.json</kbd> file with the following content:</p>
<pre>{ 
    "dependencies": { 
        "redux": "4.0.0" 
    } 
} </pre>
<p>Then, install the dependencies by opening a Terminal and running:</p>

<p>Remember that <kbd>createStore</kbd> accepts a single reducer function as the first argument. We write a store enhancer to allow the <kbd>createStore</kbd> method to accept a <kbd>Map</kbd> object containing key-value pairs, where key is the property or slice of state that will be managed, and value is a <kbd>reducer</kbd> function. Then, define two reducer functions using a <kbd>Map</kbd> object to handle two slices of the state, one for a counter and the other for setting the current time:</p>

<p>The enhancer composes the store creator into a new one. For instance, the following line:</p>
<pre>const store = createStore(map, acceptMap()) </pre>
<p>Could be written as:</p>
<pre>const store = acceptMap()(createStore)(map) </pre>
<p>Which actually, in a way, wraps the original <kbd>createStore</kbd> method into another <kbd>createStore</kbd> method.</p>
<p>Composition can be explained as a set of functions that are called accepting the result argument of the previous function. For instance:</p>
<pre>const c = (...args) =&gt; f(g(h(...args))) </pre>
<p>This composes functions <kbd>f</kbd>, <kbd>g</kbd>, and <kbd>h</kbd> from right to left into a single function <kbd>c</kbd>. That means, we could write the previous line of code also like this:</p>
<pre>const _createStore = acceptMap()(createStore) 
const store = _createStore(map) </pre>
<p>Here <kbd>_createStore</kbd> is the result of composing <kbd>createStore</kbd> and your store enhancer function.</p>

<p>Build a counter application that will randomly increment or decrement the initial specified counter 10 times when the application is run on the browser. However, because it happens fast, the user won't be able to notice that the state has actually changed 10 times since the application started. We will use the Redux DevTools Extension to navigate and analyze how the state has changed over time.</p>
<p>First, build a small ExpressJS server application that will serve the client application and the Redux library installed in <kbd>node_modules</kbd>:</p>

      ) </pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Save the file</li>
</ol>
<p>Next, build your counter, Redux powered application, with time travel capabilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new file named <kbd>time-travel.html</kbd></li>
<li>Add the following HTML code:</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Redux DevTools</strong> has some features that you will probably find amazing and helpful for debugging and managing the state of your application. In fact, if you followed the previous recipes, I suggest you go back to the projects we wrote and enable this enhancer and try to experiment with Redux DevTools.</p>
<p>One of many features of Redux DevTools is the <span class="packt_screen">Log monitor</span>, which displays in chronological order which action was dispatched and the resulting value of transforming the state:</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Understanding Redux middleware</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Probably the easiest and best way of extending the Redux functionality is by using middleware.</p>
<p>There is a store enhancer function that comes in the Redux library named <kbd>applyMiddleware</kbd> and allows you define one or multiple middleware functions. The way middleware works in Redux is simple, it allows you to wrap the <kbd>dispatch</kbd> method of the store to extend its functionality. The same way as store enhancer functions, middleware is composable and has the following signature:</p>
<pre>middleware = API =&gt; next =&gt; action =&gt; next(action) </pre>
<p>Here, <kbd>API</kbd> is an object containing the <kbd>dispatch</kbd> and <kbd>getState</kbd> methods from the store, destructuring the <kbd>API</kbd>, the signature looks like this:</p>
<pre>middleware = ({ 
    getState, 
    dispatch, 
}) =&gt; next =&gt; action =&gt; next(action)  </pre>
<p>Let's analyze how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <kbd>applyMiddleware</kbd> function receives one or more middleware functions as arguments. For example:</li>
</ol>
<pre>      applyMiddleware(middleware1, middleware2) </pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Each middleware function is kept internally as an <kbd>Array</kbd>. Then, internally using the <kbd>Array.prototype.map</kbd> method, the array maps each middleware function by calling itself providing the middleware <kbd>API</kbd> object which contains the <kbd>dispatch</kbd> and <kbd>getState</kbd> methods of the store. Similar to this:</li>
</ol>
<pre>      middlewares.map((middleware) =&gt; middleware(API)) </pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Then, by composing all the middleware functions, it computes a new value for the <kbd>dispatch</kbd> method providing the <kbd>next</kbd> argument. In the very first middleware that is executed, the <kbd>next</kbd> argument refers to the original <kbd>dispatch</kbd> method before any middleware was applied. For instance, if applying three middleware functions, the new computed dispatch method's signature would be:</li>
</ol>
<pre>      dispatch = (action) =&gt; ( 
          (action) =&gt; ( 
              (action) =&gt; store.dispatch(action) 
          )(action) 
      )(action) </pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>Which means that a middleware function can interrupt the chain and prevent a certain action from being dispatched if the <kbd>next(action)</kbd> method is not called</li>
<li>The dispatch method from the middleware <kbd>API</kbd> object, allows you to call the dispatch method of the store with the previously applied middleware. That means, if you are not careful while using this method, you may create an infinite loop</li>
</ol>
<p>Understanding how it works internally may not be so simple at first, but I assure you that you will get it soon.</p>

<p>In this recipe, you will write a middleware function that will warn the user when dispatching an action type that has not been defined. First, create a new <kbd>package.json</kbd> file with the following content:</p>

<p>Redux doesn't warn you or display errors when an action type, that was never defined within your reducers, is used. Build a NodeJS application that will use Redux to manage its state. Focus on writing a middleware function that will check that the dispatched actions types are defined or else throw an error:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new file named <kbd>type-check-redux.js</kbd>.</li>
<li>Include the Redux library:</li>
</ol>
<pre>      const { 
          createStore, 
          applyMiddleware, 
      } = require('redux') </pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Define an object containing the allowed action types:</li>
</ol>
<pre>      const TYPE = { 
          INCREMENT: 'INCREMENT', 
          DECREMENT: 'DECREMENT', 
          SET_TIME: 'SET_TIME', 
      } </pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>Create a dummy reducer function that returns its original state whichever action type is called. We don't need it for the purpose of this recipe:</li>
</ol>
<pre>      const reducer = ( 
          state = null, 
          action, 
      ) =&gt; state </pre>
<ol start="5">
<li>Define a middleware function that will intercept every action that is being dispatched and check whether the action type exists in the <kbd>TYPE</kbd> object. If the action exists allow the action to be dispatched, or otherwise, throw an error and inform the user that an invalid action type was dispatched. Additionally, let's provide the user, as part of the error message, information about which valid types are allowed:</li>
</ol>
<pre>      const typeCheckMiddleware = api =&gt; next =&gt; action =&gt; { 
          if (Reflect.has(TYPE, action.type)) { 
              next(action) 
          } else { 
              const err = new Error( 
                  `Type "${action.type}" is not a valid` + 
                  `action type. ` + 
                  `did you mean to use one of the following` + 
                  `valid types? ` + 
                  `"${Reflect.ownKeys(TYPE).join('"|"')}"n`, 
              ) 
              throw err 
          } 
      } </pre>
<ol start="6">
<li>Create a store and apply the defined middleware function:</li>
</ol>
<pre>      const store = createStore( 
          reducer, 
          applyMiddleware(typeCheckMiddleware), 
      ) </pre>
<ol start="7">
<li>Dispatch two action types. The first action type is valid, and it exists in the <kbd>TYPE</kbd> object. However, the second one is an action type that was never defined:</li>
</ol>
<pre>      store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' }) 
      store.dispatch({ type: 'MISTAKE' }) </pre>

<p>First, open a new Terminal and run:</p>
<pre>    <strong>node type-check-redux.js </strong></pre>
<p>The Terminal output should display an error similar to this:</p>
<pre>/type-check-redux.js:25 
                throw err 
                ^ 
Error: Type "MISTAKE" is not a valid action type. did you mean to use one of the following valid types? "INCREMENT"|"DECREMENT"|"SET_TIME" 
    at Object.action [as dispatch] (/type-check-redux.js:18:15) 
    at Object.&lt;anonymous&gt; (/type-check-redux.js:33:7) </pre>
<p>In this example, the stack trace tells us that the error happened on line <kbd>18</kbd>, which points to our middleware function. However, the next one points to line <kbd>33</kbd>, <kbd>store.dispatch({ type: 'MISTAKE' })</kbd>, which is a good thing because it can help you track exactly where certain actions are dispatched that were never defined.</p>

<p>It's pretty simple, the middleware function checks the action type, of the action being dispatched, to see if it exists as a property of the <kbd>TYPE</kbd> object constant. If it exists, then the middleware passes control to the next middleware in the chain. However, in our case, there is no next middleware, so the control is passed to the original dispatch method of the store that will apply the reducer and transform the state. On the other side, if the action type was not defined, the middleware function interrupts the middleware chain by not calling the <kbd>next</kbd> function and by throwing an error.</p>

<p>By default, Redux doesn't handle asynchronous data flow. There are several libraries out there that can help you with these tasks.

<p>In this recipe, you will build an ExpressJS application with a very small API to test your application when making HTTP requests and dealing with asynchronous data flow and errors. First, create a new <kbd>package.json</kbd> file with the following content:</p>

<li>Every time there is a change in the state, the subscribed listener function will pretty print in the terminal the current state tree</li>
<li>The first dispatched action is synchronous. It will cause the time slice of the state tree to be updated like this, for example:</li>
</ol>
<pre>      time: { 
          value: "01:02:03 GMT+0000", 
          error: null, 
          status: "RESOLVED" 
      } </pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>The second action being dispatched is asynchronous. Internally, two actions are dispatched to reflect the state of the asynchronous operation, one when the async function is still in execution, and another when the async function was fulfilled:</li>
</ol>
<pre>      time: { 
          value: null, 
          error: null, 
          status: "PENDING" 
      } 
      // Later, once the operation is fulfilled: 
      time: { 
          value: "01:02:03 GMT+0000", 
          error: null, 
          status: "RESOLVED" 
      } </pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>The third action being dispatched is also asynchronous. Internally, it also causes two actions to be dispatched to reflect the state of the async operation:</li>
</ol>
<pre>      date: { 
          value: null, 
          error: null, 
          status: "PENDING" 
      } 
      // Later, once the operation is fulfilled: 
      date: { 
          value: null, 
          error: "request to http://localhost:1337/date failed, reason:   <br/>             socket hang up", 
          status: "REJECTED" 
      } </pre>
<ol start="5">
<li>Take into account that because the operations are asynchronous, the output displayed in the terminal may not always be in the same order</li>
<li>Notice that the first async operation is fulfilled and the status marked as <kbd>RESOLVED</kbd> while the second async operation is fulfilled and its status marked as <kbd>REJECTED</kbd></li>
<li>The statuses <kbd>PENDING</kbd>, <kbd>RESOLVED</kbd>, and <kbd>REJECTED</kbd> reflect the three statuses that a JavaScript Promise can be, and they are not obligatory names, simply easy to remember</li>

<p>If you don't want to write your own middleware functions or store enhancers to deal with asynchronous operations, you can opt to use one of the many libraries for Redux that exist out there. Two of the most use or popular ones are these:</p>
