		<div><p class="callout-heading">Overview</p>
			<p class="callout">By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to demonstrate JavaScript syntax and structure; write comments and debugging code; implement conditional logic and looping; write functions and invoke them in the code; and construct events that react to user input and update the DOM.</p>
			<p class="callout">This chapter serves as an introduction to the fundamental concepts and structures that are involved when working in JavaScript and really, programming in general.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-77"><a id="_idTextAnchor084"/>Introduction</h1>
			<p>In the previous chapter, you were introduced to some popular JavaScript tools and the various available runtimes for executing code with the modern web browser. We also explored web browser interactions and saw how we can control both the style and content of elements within the web browser with the use of common JavaScript functions in the <strong class="bold">Integrated Development Environment</strong> (<strong class="bold">IDE</strong>).</p>
			<p>You have already seen large chunks of JavaScript code; however, understanding what each function works for is a key skill for any good developer. This chapter serves as an introduction to the fundamental concepts and structures involved in writing programs in JavaScript. We'll cover all the basics, from object types to conditionals and looping structures, how to go about writing and invoking functions, and even commenting and debugging their code.</p>
			<p>From using variables to store and calculate data to using <code>if/else</code> statements to apply conditions to different variables, this chapter will be one of the most important stepping stones in your JavaScript learning path. A detailed understanding of Booleans, strings, objects, arrays, functions, arguments, and so on will improve your development skills.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-78"><a id="_idTextAnchor085"/>Data Types</h1>
			<p>Programming is all about manipulating data. Data can represent values such as people's names, temperature, image dimensions, the amount of disk storage, and total likes on a discussion group post.</p>
			<p>All the data in a program has a data type. The data types that you usually learn to use first in JavaScript are number, string, boolean, object, array, and function. The number, string, and Boolean data types represent a single value. Objects represent more complex data. Functions are for writing programs.</p>
			<p>Some common JavaScript data types with their uses and descriptions are as follows: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">number</strong>: Any positive or negative value whole numbers, usually called integers and floating-point numbers, that can be used in mathematical operations. It is used in product prices, checkout totals, the number of likes on a post, the geometry value of Pi, and can be used as a random number.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">string</strong>: Any set of valid characters that cannot be, or are not intended to be, used in computational operations. They are used to comment on a discussion post which can be a company name, a street address, name of a place, an account number, a telephone number, or a postal number.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">boolean</strong>: Any value representing true and false. It is used to check whether a form can be submitted, whether a password meets its required characters, whether an order balance qualifies for free shipping, and whether a button can be clicked.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">object</strong>:  An unordered collection of values, called properties, and code, called methods, that are intended to work together. It is used for real-world objects such as an order, stopwatch, clock, date, or microwave. They can be used for software objects such as a web page document, an HTML element on a web page, a CSS style rule, or an HTTP request.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">function</strong>: A specialized object data type that represents a block of code. The code can use optional input data and optionally return data. They can be used for the conversion of data such as temperature, finding a value in a list, updating the style of an HTML element, sending data to a web server, revealing a message on the screen, or checking for valid data entry formats such as an email address.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-79"><a id="_idTextAnchor086"/>Representation of Data</h2>
			<p>Data is represented in programs using expressions. If you've ever worked with a spreadsheet program, then expressions are analogous to cell formulas. Expressions can be resolved to a value representing a specific data type.</p>
			<p>Expressions can be broken down into smaller parts, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Literal values</li>
				<li>Operators</li>
				<li>Variables</li>
				<li>Functions that return data</li>
				<li>Object properties</li>
				<li>Object methods that return data</li>
			</ul>
			<p>A good place to start learning about expressions is with literal values, operators, and variables. Functions and objects are covered separately, later in this chapter, and we will revisit them through their use in expressions.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-80"><a id="_idTextAnchor087"/>Literal Values</h3>
			<p>Literal values are written into the programming code. Literal values are static. This means that they have the same value every time the line of code is executed, and they cannot be changed.</p>
			<p>Literal data needs to be formatted according to the rules for its data type. Number, string, and Boolean values are a good place to start so that we can understand the formatting of literal values. Functions and object literals are covered in their own topics later. Here is a list of some of their types and their rules and an example of each valid and invalid case:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>1000000</code>, <code>101</code>, <code>9.876</code>, and <code>-0.1234</code>. Invalid examples include <code>1,000,000</code>, <code>$1000000</code>, and <code>1 000 000</code>.</li>
				<li><code>'ABC Company'</code>, <code>"Earth's Moon"</code>, <code>"She yelled \"duck\"!"</code>, <code>'She yelled "duck"!'</code>, and so on. Invalid examples include <code>ABC Company</code>, and <code>"She yelled "duck"!"</code>.</li>
				<li><code>true</code> and <code>false</code> are valid examples, whereas invalid examples include <code>True</code>, <code>TRUE</code>, <code>FALSE</code>, and <code>False</code>. </li>
			</ul>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-81"><a id="_idTextAnchor089"/>Using Operators in Expressions</h3>
			<p>Operators are used to performing arithmetic, combine text, make logical comparisons, and assign values to variables and properties. </p>
			<p>The operators we look at can be grouped as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Arithmetic</li>
				<li>String</li>
				<li>Grouping</li>
				<li>Comparison</li>
				<li>Logical</li>
				<li>typeof</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For math computations, we use arithmetic operators. The string operator allows us to combine parts of an expression into a string value. The following table describes certain arithmetic operators and some examples:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 3.1: Arithmetic operators&#13;&#10;" src="img/C14377_03_01.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.1: Arithmetic operators</p>
			<p>Let's say we could use <code>+</code>, which is concatenation. It converts non-string data types into strings. The following code shows three separate examples: </p>
			<pre>"Blue" + "Moon"
"Blue" + " " + "Moon"
"$" + 100 * .10 + " discount"</pre>
			<p>The output for each would be as follows:</p>
			<pre>"BlueMoon"
"Blue Moon"
"$10 discount"</pre>
			<p>Expressions are not evaluated left to right. Instead, they are evaluated based on a preset operator order, which is called the operator precedence. For example, the multiplication operator has higher precedence than the addition operator does. You can override the operator's precedence using the grouping operator. It forces the evaluation of the expression contained within it before the rest of the expression is evaluated.</p>
			<p>For example, the <code>()</code> operator controls the precedence of expression evaluation: </p>
			<pre>1 + 2 * 3
(1 + 2) * 3
10 + 10 * 5 + 5
(10 + 10) * (5 + 5)</pre>
			<p>The output for each of the preceding examples would be as follows:</p>
			<pre>7 
9
65
100</pre>
			<p>Comparing data is an important part of programming. The resulting value of comparing data is either true or false. A portion of an expression can be compared to another portion using the comparison operators, which are sometimes called relational operators. The following table describes certain comparison operators, along with examples:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 3.2: Comparison operators&#13;&#10;" src="img/C14377_03_02.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.2: Comparison operators</p>
			<p>Multiple parts of an expression can be compared using logical operators. These are sometimes called Boolean operators. Some Boolean operators, along with a description of them and examples, are as follows:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 3.3: Logical operators&#13;&#10;" src="img/C14377_03_03.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.3: Logical operators</p>
			<p>Not all operators are symbols. A very helpful operator is <code>typeof</code>. It shows the data type as a string. The operator is all lowercase letters. Use the group operator to get the type of an expression using other operators.</p>
			<p>For example, the <code>typeof</code> operator controls the precedence of expression evaluation: </p>
			<pre>typeof 100
TypeOf 100
typeof "100"
typeof true
typeof (1 &gt; 2)
typeof (2 + " dozen eggs")</pre>
			<p>The output for each of the preceding examples would be as follows:</p>
			<pre>number
Uncaught SyntaxError: …
boolean
boolean
string
string</pre>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">It's good practice to surround operators with a space. Exceptions are to not use spaces before or after the grouping operator <code>( )</code> and before the logical not <code>!</code> operator.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-82"><a id="_idTextAnchor090"/>Exercise 3.01: Implementing Expressions and Operators</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, you will interactively enter number, string, and comparison expressions into a web browser console window and review the results. Let's get started. Open the <code>data-expressions.html</code> document in your web browser:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Open the web developer console window using your web browser.<p>In the next couple of steps, we will implement a few expressions using number data and arithmetic operators. Type the items on the lines beginning with the <code>&gt;</code> symbol. The console window will show a response on the lines beginning with the <code>&lt;</code> symbol.</p></li>
				<li>Write the following code to add two literal whole numbers:<pre>&gt; 200 + 200
\\output
&lt; 400</pre></li>
				<li>Write the following code to divide the literal whole numbers:<pre>&gt; 1000 / 4
\\Output
&lt; 250</pre></li>
				<li>Now, write the following code to divide a real number by a whole number:<pre>&gt; 150.75 / 3
\\Output
&lt; 50.25</pre></li>
				<li>Multiplication has a higher order of operator precedence, which is demonstrated with the following code:<pre>&gt; 100 + 100 * 2
\\Output
&lt; 300</pre></li>
				<li>We can use parentheses to change the order of operational precedence, as shown here:<pre>&gt; (100 + 100) * 2
\\Output
&lt; 400</pre></li>
				<li>To show the data type of a real number, we can use <code>typeof</code>, as shown here:<pre>&gt;typeof 987.123
\\Output
&lt; "number"</pre></li>
				<li>Let's try the following command:<pre>&gt; 123 456 789
\\Output
&lt; Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected number</pre><p>The output is a syntax error because you cannot have a number in this format with spaces (<code>123 456</code> <code>789</code> is not recognized as a number, but <code>123456789</code> is).</p></li>
				<li>We can compare two whole numbers using the <code>&gt;</code> operator, as shown here:<pre>&gt; 100 &gt; 200
\\Output
&lt; false</pre></li>
				<li>Similarly, we can compare two whole numbers using the <code>&lt;</code> operator:<pre>&gt; 100 &lt; 200
\\Output
&lt; true</pre></li>
				<li>Now, we can switch over and work with string data. Let's have a look at the output when we enter a literal string using double quotes as a delimiter:<pre>&gt; "Albert Einstein"
\\Output
&lt; "Albert Einstein"</pre><p>The next couple of snippets will show different examples of using literal strings.</p></li>
				<li>Using a literal string without delimiters would result in an error since JavaScript would not recognize such an input:<pre>&gt; Albert Einstein
\\Output
&lt; Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier</pre></li>
				<li>You can use a literal string using double-quotes. Suppose you want to return the statement in double-quotes. You can place the double quotes in between a single quote:<pre>&gt; 'The quote "The only source of knowledge is experience" is attributed to Albert Einstein'
\\Output
&lt; The quote "The only source of knowledge is experience" is attributed to Albert Einstein</pre></li>
				<li>Use the <code>\</code> escape character to use a delimiter. This turns special characters into string characters:<pre>&gt; "The quote \"The only source of knowledge is experience\" is attributed to Albert Einstein"
\\Output. Notice the escape character is removed.
&lt; The quote "The only source of knowledge is experience" is attributed to Albert Einstein</pre></li>
				<li>A non-mathematic number such as a phone number without delimiters will be converted into a number:<pre>&gt; 123-456-7890
\\Output. Expression converted to number
&lt; -8223</pre></li>
				<li>A non-mathematic number such as a phone number will appear as follows because we are using "":<pre>&gt; "123-456-7890"
\\Output
&lt; "123-456-7890"</pre></li>
				<li>We can also combine numbers and a literal string, as shown here:<pre>&gt; 100 - 10 + " Main Street"
\\Output. 
&lt; "90 Main Street" 
When string is in expression JavaScript attempts to convert all other elements to a string.</pre></li>
				<li>We can use the <code>==</code> operator to compare two strings with the same case:<pre>&gt; "Albert Einstein" == "Albert Einstein"
\\Output
&lt; true</pre></li>
				<li>Now, let's try comparing two strings with a different case:<pre>&gt; "Albert Einstein" == "ALBERT EINSTEIN"
\\Output
&lt; false</pre></li>
				<li>When we compare a number with a string with the same numeric value using the <code>==</code> operator, data type conversion takes place. This is shown in the following snippet:<pre>&gt; 100 == "100"
\\Output. Data type conversion takes place
&lt; true</pre></li>
				<li>If we want data type conversion to not take place before the comparison is made, we need to use the <code>===</code> operator, as shown here:<pre>&gt; 100 === "100"
\\Output. No data type conversion
&lt; false</pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>We used several operators and expressions in the preceding exercise. Real-world use cases of these operators and expressions would vary, depending on the type of applications being developed. However, the preceding exercise is a good starting point with regard to using these in actual programs. Note that, so far, the examples we used were using literal values. However, this may not always be the case in a real-world application. Often, values change dynamically while a program executes, and the use of variables in expressions becomes inevitable in such cases. The next section teaches you how you can use variables and constants in expressions.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-83"><a id="_idTextAnchor091"/>Using Variables and Constants in Expressions</h3>
			<p>Variables and constants are symbolic names that are assigned to values. The value of a variable can be changed after it is assigned. The value that's assigned to a constant cannot be changed. Variables and constants involve the following items:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Declaration keyword</li>
				<li>Name</li>
				<li>Assignment operator</li>
				<li>Expressions</li>
				<li>Data type</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Variables and constants need to be <code>var</code> and <code>let</code>. For constants, the declaration keyword is <code>const</code>.</p>
			<p>Variables and constants require a <code>=</code>. The variable's data type is dynamic and is the same as the expression.</p>
			<p>Variables do not need to be assigned a value when declared. A constant must be assigned a value when declared.</p>
			<p>Have a look at the following examples of declaring a variable without assigning a value:</p>
			<pre>var firstName
var totalLikes
var errorMessage
var isSold</pre>
			<p>Variables that are not assigned a value still have a data type. That data type is named <code>typeof</code> operator detects undefined data types.</p>
			<p>Here are some examples of declaring a variable and assigning a value:</p>
			<pre>var firstName = "Albert"
var totalLikes = 50
var errorMessage = "Something terrible happened"
var isSold = false</pre>
			<p>Some examples of assigning a value to a variable that's been previously declared are as follows:</p>
			<pre>firstName = "Marie"                         
totalLikes = 50
errorMessage = "Something terrible happened"
isSold = false</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-84"><a id="_idTextAnchor092"/>Exercise 3.02: Working with Variables Using the Web Browser Console</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, you will use the web browser console window to work with variables. You will practice declaring variables, assigning values, and checking their data types. Let's get started:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Use the <code>variables.html</code> file from <a href="https://packt.live/370myse">https://packt.live/370myse</a> in your web browser. </li>
				<li>Open the web developer console window using your web browser.</li>
				<li>Type the items onto the lines beginning with the <code>&gt;</code> symbol. The console window will show a response on the lines beginning with the <code>&lt;</code> symbol.</li>
				<li>Declare a variable named <code>firstName</code>:<pre>&gt; var firstName
\\Value is expressed as undefined
&lt; undefined</pre></li>
				<li>Write the data type of the variable:<pre>&gt;typeoffirstName
\\Output
&lt; "undefined"
This is expected as we have not defined our variable with any value.</pre></li>
				<li>Assign the string value <code>Albert</code> to the <code>firstName</code> variable:<pre>&gt;firstName = "Albert"
\\Output
&lt; "Albert"</pre></li>
				<li>To find out what data type our input is, use the <code>typeof</code> keyword, as shown here:<pre>&gt;typeoffirstName
\\Output
&lt; "string"
As expected, our input is correctly identified as beginning a string.</pre></li>
				<li>To find out what value our <code>firstName</code> variable is holding, we simply need to write the following code:<pre>&gt;firstName
\\Output
&lt; "Albert"
Until now, we have used strings. In the next step, we will define a new variable and store a number value in it.</pre></li>
				<li>Declare a variable and assign it to a number expression:<pre>&gt; var totalLikes = 50
\\Output. Console may express value when declared but before assigned
&lt; undefined</pre></li>
				<li>Write the value of <code>totalLikes</code>:<pre>&gt;totalLikes
\\Output
&lt; 50</pre></li>
				<li>To ascertain the data type, we will once again use <code>typeof</code>, as shown here:<pre>&gt;typeoftotalLikes
&lt; "number"</pre><p>So far, we haven't changed the values our variables are holding. We shall do this in the next step.</p></li>
				<li>Here is the code for changing the value held by <code>totalLikes</code>:<pre>&gt;totalLikes = totalLikes + 1
\\Output. New value is expressed
&lt; 51</pre><p>We can use the comparison operator, <code>&gt;</code>, to compare the value our variable is holding with a reference value. This is done in the next step.</p></li>
				<li>Compare the value of <code>totalLikes</code> using the following code: <pre>&gt;totalLikes&gt; 100
&lt; false</pre><p>The result is obviously false as the current value of <code>totalLikes</code> is <code>51</code>.</p><p>Now, let's define a new variable and use Boolean expressions.</p></li>
				<li>Declare a variable and assign it to a Boolean expression:<pre>&gt; var isSold = false
\\Output. Console may express undefined data type when declared but before assigned.
&lt; undefined</pre></li>
				<li>Write the data type, like so:<pre>&gt;typeofisSold
&lt; "boolean"</pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>You have now interactively worked with declaring variables, assigned them values, and used them in expressions. We defined variables with different inputs such as strings, numbers, and Boolean values. You also used the <code>typeof</code> operator to reveal the data type of a variable. Now, we will progress to another important topic — functions. </p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-85"><a id="_idTextAnchor093"/>Functions That Return Values</h3>
			<p>Functions may be written to return a value. In that case, we can use them in expressions. When we use a function, it is also called invoking the function.</p>
			<p>To use a function in an expression, you need to include the function name, followed by parentheses. If the function requires input, it is placed inside the parentheses as valid expressions. These are called arguments. If more than one argument is needed, they are separated with commas.</p>
			<p>These examples assume that the function will return a value.</p>
			<p>Have a look at this example on expressing functions that do not require an argument:</p>
			<pre>getTotal() 
isLoggedIn()</pre>
			<p>This example shows us expressing a function that has one argument expressed as a number literal:</p>
			<pre>getCelsiusFromFahrenheit(32)</pre>
			<p>This example shows us expressing a function that has multiple arguments using literal values:</p>
			<pre>getSearchResults("Pet Names", 25)</pre>
			<p>Finally, this example shows us expressing a function that has multiple arguments using variables:</p>
			<pre>var amount = 100000
var decimals = 2
var decimalSeparator = "."
var thousandsSeparator = ","
formatCurrency(amount, decimals, decimalSeparator, thousandsSeparator)</pre>
			<p>When you see a function in an expression, think of it as representing a value.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-86"><a id="_idTextAnchor094"/>Exercise 3.03: Using Functions in Expressions</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, we will use a predefined function and then use it in expressions. This exercise will show how you can invoke, check, and return the data type, and use functions in expressions. For the purpose of this exercise, we will use a function defined as <code>getDiceRoll</code>. Let's get started:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <code>use-functions.html</code> document in your web browser.</li>
				<li>Open the web developer, <code>console window</code>, using your web browser.<p>The web page has a function named <code>getDiceRoll</code>. It returns the value of one rolled dice. It has one argument. The argument allows you to supply the number of dice to roll. Type the items on the lines beginning with the <code>&gt;</code> symbol. The console window will show a response on the lines beginning with the <code>&lt;·</code> symbol.</p></li>
				<li>Express the data type. Note that a function name without parentheses is used:<pre>&gt;typeofgetDiceRoll
\\Expressed as a function type. It also assures us that there is a function.
&lt;·function</pre></li>
				<li>Express the return value data type. Note that a function name with parentheses is used:<pre>&gt;typeofgetDiceRoll()
\\Function return value is a number. We do not see the actual value.
&lt;·"number"</pre></li>
				<li>Invoke the function using the following code:<pre>&gt;getDiceRoll()
\\Your value will be 1 to 6. Repeat a few times.
&lt;·3</pre><p>We can also invoke functions in math expressions.</p></li>
				<li>Invoke the function in a math expression:<pre>&gt; 100 * getDiceRoll()
\\Your value will be 100 to 600 Repeat a few times.
&lt;·300</pre><p>We can also invoke functions in a comparison expression.</p></li>
				<li>Invoke the function in a comparison expression:<pre>&gt;getDiceRoll() == 4
\\You may need to repeat a few times to get a true result.
&lt;·true</pre><p>So far, we haven't passed any arguments for our functions. However, remember that we do have the option to do so as our function is defined to accept a single argument. This argument defines the number of dices that will be rolled. Let's try passing an argument in the next step.</p></li>
				<li>Invoke and supply the argument for the number of dice to roll as 2:<pre>&gt;getDiceRoll(2)
\\You will receive values from 2 to 12.
&lt;·11</pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Functions are critical to JavaScript programming. To get you started, we have only shown how you can use predefined functions. You will learn to write your own functions later in this chapter. However, you may come across scenarios in which you may have to use functions that have already been created. This exercise was a good starting point in showing you how this can be done. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-87"><a id="_idTextAnchor095"/>The Object Data Type</h2>
			<p>JavaScript is designed around object data, thus making it important to understand. There are JavaScript objects that have been ready-made for us to use and you, as a programmer, will create objects. In either case, JavaScript objects are composed of <strong class="bold">properties</strong> and <strong class="bold">methods</strong>:</p>
			<p>Property: A value that has an assigned named. Together, they are often called a name/value pair.  Values can be any type, that is, data, a number, a string, a Boolean, or an object. Property values can be changed dynamically.</p>
			<p>Method: A function that performs an action.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-88"><a id="_idTextAnchor096"/>Ready-Made Objects</h3>
			<p>JavaScript has ready-made objects that we can use to help us begin to learn how to program. There are many useful objects built into JavaScript. Web browsers provide a collection of objects called the Document Object Model (DOM). </p>
			<p>Some examples of ready-made objects are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>window</code> is an object in DOM. It has access to the web browser's open window. Often considered a top-level DOM object containing other web browser-created objects as its properties, it has methods for setting timer events and printing.</li>
				<li><code>console</code> is an object in DOM. It provides the ability to output to the web browser console window. It is also a property of the window object.</li>
				<li><code>document</code> is an object in DOM. It has access to a web page's HTML elements, styles, and content. It is also a property of the window object.</li>
				<li><code>location</code> is an object in DOM. It has information about the current URL. It is a property of the window object.</li>
				<li><code>Math</code> is a built-in object. It consists of math constants such as Pi, and functions such as rounding.</li>
				<li><code>Date</code> is a built-in object. It provides calendar date and time operations.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-89"><a id="_idTextAnchor097"/>Exercise 3.04: Working with Ready-Made Objects</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, we will experiment with the properties and methods of ready-made objects that are available to JavaScript in the web browser. We will use the random, round, ceil, and floor methods to invoke a math object from a pre-defined object. Let's get started:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <code>objects-ready-made.html</code> document in your web browser.</li>
				<li>Open the web developer console window using your web browser.</li>
				<li>First, we will start with the web browser document object. Type the items on the lines beginning with the <code>&gt;</code> symbol. The console window will show a response on the lines beginning with the <code>&lt;·</code> symbol.</li>
				<li>Display the document object title property:<pre>&gt;document.title
\\Output
&lt;&lt; "JavaScript Data and Expression Practice | Packt Publishing"</pre></li>
				<li>Now, display the document object <code>doctype</code> property:<pre>&gt;document.doctype
\\Output
&lt;&lt;!doctype html&gt;</pre></li>
				<li>Display the document object <code>lastModified</code> property:<pre>&gt;document.lastModified
\\Your output may have a different time and date value.
&lt; "09/09/2019 21:58:25"</pre></li>
				<li>Declare a variable and assign it to the <code>HTMLElement</code> object variable using the document object <code>getElementById</code> method:<pre>&gt; var pageHeadEle = document.getElementById('page-heading')
\\Console may express undefined data type when declared but before assigned. 
&lt;·undefined</pre></li>

				<li>Invoke the <code>random</code> method for the Math object: <pre>&gt;Math.random()
&lt; 0.9857480203668554</pre><p>The <code>Math.random()</code> method returns a random number from the range <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>, both inclusive. It returns a different value with every call.</p></li>

				<li>Use the Math object's <code>round</code> method:<pre>&gt;Math.round(10.4)
&lt;·10</pre><p>The <code>Math.round()</code> method returns the number after rounding it off to its nearest integer. </p></li>

\\Output
&lt; 1</pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>There are many ready-made objects available in JavaScript. They are used just like other functions and variables, except we call the functions as methods and the variables as properties. </p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-90"><a id="_idTextAnchor098"/>Self-Made Objects</h3>
			<p>You often have to create objects when developing real-world applications. They help you organize a set of data and functions that work together. Think about what properties and methods you may use for a stopwatch object.</p>
			<p>You can see that we named the properties and methods as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>elapsedTime</code> is a property with a data type number. It displays the seconds that have elapsed since timing started.</li>
				<li><code>resultsHistory</code> is a property data type object. It displays a list of previous timings.</li>
				<li><code>isTiming</code> is a property data type Boolean. It displays the state of its timing.</li>
				<li><code>isPaused</code> is a property data type Boolean. It displays the state if paused. </li>
				<li><code>start</code> is a method data type function. It starts timing and sets <code>elapsedTime</code> to <code>0</code>.</li>
				<li><code>pause</code> is a method data type function. It pauses the timing.</li>
				<li><code>resume</code> is a method data type function. It resumes the timing.</li>
				<li><code>stop</code> is a method data type function. It stops timing and adds the result to <code>resultsHistory</code>.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-91"><a id="_idTextAnchor099"/>Object Dot Notation</h3>
			<p>To reference object properties and methods, you use dot notation. This is the object name, followed by a period, and then the name of the property or method. Let's use the <code>stopWatch</code> object as an example:</p>
			<pre>stopWatch.elapsedTime
stopWatch.start()
stopWatch.start()
stopWatch.stop()</pre>
			<p>Methods require parentheses after the name. If the method requires data input, the data is placed inside the parentheses.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-92"><a id="_idTextAnchor100"/>The Array Object</h3>
			<p>Arrays are objects that represent a list of values. Each item in the list is called an element. To initialize an array, you can set it to an array literal. An array literal is a comma-separated list of expressions enclosed in square brackets, like so:</p>
			<pre>["Saab", "Ford", "BMW", "GM"]</pre>
			<p>Elements in arrays can be different data types. Often, all the elements are the same data type:</p>
			<pre>["Milk", false, 123, document, "Gold", -.9876]</pre>
			<p>Elements in a literal array can be expressions, but they are evaluated and only the expression values are stored:</p>
			<pre>[price - cost, Math.random(), document.title, someVariable / 2]</pre>
			<p>Variables and object properties can contain arrays:</p>
			<pre>let todoList = [
 "Wash Laundry",
 "Clean Silver",
 "Write Letters",
 "Purchase Groceries",
 "Retrieve Mail",
 "Prepare Dinner"
]
game.scores = [120, 175, 145, 200]</pre>
			<p>Array elements can be arrays:</p>
			<pre>notes = [
 [
  "Wash Laundry",
  "Clean Silver",
  "Write Letters"
 ], 123, "999-999-9999"
]</pre>
			<p>The array objects with useful properties and methods are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>length</code> is a property with a number data-type that displays the number of items in the array.</li>
				<li><code>push</code> is a method with a number data-type that appends an element and returns the new length.</li>
				<li><code>unshift</code> is a method with a number data-type that prepends an element and returns the new length.</li>
				<li><code>shift</code> is a method with a mixed data-type that removes the first element and returns the removed element's value.</li>
				<li><code>pop</code> is a method with a mixed data-type that removes the last element to return the removed element's value.</li>
				<li><code>concat</code> is a method with a function data-type that merges two or more arrays to return a new array.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-93"><a id="_idTextAnchor101"/>Using the Console Object</h3>
			<p>The <code>console</code> object has a method called <code>log</code> that we can use to test expressions in a JavaScript program. It takes an unlimited number of expressions separated by commas. All the expressions we enter into the console window would work with the <code>console.log</code> method. It evaluates the expressions and returns their results in the console. Multiple expressions are separated by a space.</p>
			<p>The <code>console.log</code> method will be used in the upcoming exercises. Let's have a look at its syntax:</p>
			<pre>console.log(expression 1[, expression 2][, expression n])</pre>
			<p>Here are some examples of the <code>console.log</code> method:</p>
			<pre>console.log("Odd number count started!");
console.log("Iteration:", i);
console.log("Number:", number);
console.log(oddsCount + " odd numbers found!");
console.log(document);</pre>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-94"><a id="_idTextAnchor102"/>Syntax</h1>
			<p>Programs follow a set of rules that define keywords, symbols, and structure. This is called the syntax. We have already learned about many of the syntax rules in JavaScript for expressing data, variables, and expressions. You will be required to name objects, properties, methods, variables, and functions. </p>
			<p>The following is a basic set of rules and conventions. Conventions are another term for best practices. Although not following a convention will not cause issues in your coding, they can make your code less easy to follow and not palatable to other programmers, for example, who may be interviewing you for a job and ask to see your code samples.</p>
			<p>The naming rules and conventions for functions and variables are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>26 upper and lowercase letters (<strong class="bold">A-Z, a-z</strong>).</li>
				<li>Any character but the first character can be one of 10 digits (<strong class="bold">0-9</strong>).</li>
				<li>No spaces, dashes, or commas. The underscore (<strong class="bold">_</strong>) character is acceptable.</li>
				<li>Capitalization follows camelCase. This means that all characters are lowercase, except for the first letters of words and except for the first word in compound worded names. </li>
				<li>No JavaScript reserved words; for example, you cannot use <code>typeof</code>, <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, and <code>const</code>.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-95"><a id="_idTextAnchor103"/>Semicolon at the End of Code Statements</h2>
			<p>Some programming languages require a semicolon <code>;</code> at the end of every executable code statement. JavaScript does not have this requirement, except when you have more than one executable code statement on the same line of a JavaScript file.</p>
			<p>Requiring a semicolon <code>;</code> at the end of every executable code statement is more of a personal or development team choice. Since the semicolon character <code>;</code> is used in other languages, often, programmers prefer to use them in JavaScript so that they get into the habit of using them and so that they spend less time dealing with syntax errors. If you choose to use the semicolon character <code>;</code>, then do it consistently.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-96"><a id="_idTextAnchor104"/>Lines of Code versus Statements</h2>
			<p>Each line in a JavaScript source file does not need to be a single line of executable code. You can break a single line of executable code into multiple source file lines, or put multiple lines of executable code on a single source file line. This flexibility allows you to format the code so that it is easier to follow and edit. </p>
			<p>The following is a single line of executable code using a single source file line:</p>
			<pre>let todoList = ["Laundry", "Letters", "Groceries", "Mail", "Dinner"]</pre>
			<p>However, it may be more desirable to use multiple source file lines, like so:</p>
			<pre>let todoList = [
 "Laundry",
 "Letters",
 "Groceries",
 "Mail",
 "Dinner"
]</pre>
			<p>You can have more than one line of code on the same line if you use <code>;</code> after the previous code line:</p>
			<pre>var bid = 10; checkBid(bid)l</pre>
			<p>You will learn that, when JavaScript files are prepared for publishing, you can optionally use an optimizer program to compress all the lines in a source file into one line. In this way, the invisible end of a line character is removed to make the file smaller.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-97"><a id="_idTextAnchor105"/>Comments</h2>
			<p>You can add a comment to your code since they are ignored when the program is executed. Comments can help us remember what the code does at a future date and inform other programmers who may need to use or work with your code.</p>
			<p>Commenting is a useful tool to keep a line of code from executing in testing. For example, let's say you have one or more lines of code that are not working as expected and you want to try alternative code. You can comment on the code in question while you try the alternatives.</p>
			<p>JavaScript has inline commenting, also known as single-line commenting. This uses the double forward slash, <code>//</code>. All the text following the double slash up to the end of the line is ignored when the program is executed. </p>
			<p>Let's have a look at some examples of inline comments. The following comment explains the next line of code:</p>
			<pre>// Hide all result message elements
matchedMsgEle.style.display = 'none';</pre>
			<p>The comment at the end of the line is explaining the code:</p>
			<pre>let numberGuessed = parseInt(guessInputEle.value); // NaN or integer</pre>
			<p>JavaScript has block commenting, also known as multi-line commenting. This uses the combined forward slash asterisk characters to mark the beginning of the comment, and the reverse of a combined asterisk forward-slash to mark the end of the comment. All the text between <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code> is ignored when the program is executed. Let's have a look at the various block comments.</p>
			<p>The following is a multiple-line block comment that contains code. This code snippet would not be executed:</p>
			<pre>/* This is a block comment.
It can span multiple lines in the file.
Code in a comment is ignored such as the next line.
var profit = revenue - cost;
 */</pre>
			<p>A block comment can be a single line in the file:</p>
			<pre>/* This is a block comment. */</pre>
			<p>The following is an example of using <code>JDoc</code> block comments for a function:</p>
			<pre>/**
 * Shuffles array elements
 * @param {array} sourceArray - Array to be shuffled.
 * @returns {array} - New array with shuffled items 
*/
function getNewShuffledArray(sourceArray){
   // Statements for function
}</pre>
			<p>There are also tools that use syntax to produce documentation of your code from comments (for example, JDoc). These tools read your source code and produce a documentation guide of your code. Comments increase the bandwidth for web pages, so they are often not seen in the source code when you inspect a web page. This is because, often, the original JavaScript file is not published, but rather a compressed version. The tools that compress the JavaScript file will remove comments by default. Comments are helpful for learning. You are encouraged to write comments in your code that explain what the code does.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-98"><a id="_idTextAnchor106"/>Conditional and Loop Flow</h1>
			<p>Statements in JavaScript are processed sequentially in the order they're loaded. That order can be changed with conditional and loop code statements. The different parts of a control statement are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Code blocks <code>{…}</code></li>
				<li>Conditional flow statements, such as <code>if...else, switch, try catch finally</code></li>
				<li>Loop statements, such as <code>for, do...while, while, for...in, and for...of</code></li>
				<li>Other control statements, such as <code>labeled</code>, <code>break</code>, and <code>continue</code></li>
			</ul>
			<p>We will describe each of these in detail in the next section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-99"><a id="_idTextAnchor107"/>Code Blocks</h2>
			<p>Code blocks are statements that are placed between an open and close curly bracket. The syntax is as follows:</p>
			<pre>//Code block     
{                
   //Statement   
   //Statement   
   //Statement   
}</pre>
			<p>Code blocks by themselves do not offer any statement flow advantage until you combine them with conditional or loop statements.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-100"><a id="_idTextAnchor108"/>Conditional Flow Statements</h2>
			<p>Conditional statements use logic expressions to choose from among a set of statements to process.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-101"><a id="_idTextAnchor109"/>if...else Statement</h3>
			<p>The <code>if</code>, <code>else...if</code>, and <code>else</code> statements give you four structures for selecting or skipping blocks of code.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-102"><a id="_idTextAnchor110"/>if Statement</h3>
			<p>Code in an <code>if</code> statement is processed if the expression evaluates to <code>true</code> and is skipped if the expression evaluates to <code>false</code>. The syntax is as follows:</p>
			<pre>if(boolean expression){
   //Statement
   //Statement
   //Statement
}
if(boolean expression)
   //Single statement</pre>
			<p>This shows the flow of the <code>if</code> statement. If the Boolean expression is <code>true</code>, the code is processed. If <code>false</code>, the code is skipped:</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-103"><a id="_idTextAnchor111"/>Exercise 3.05: Writing an if statement</h2>
			<p>In this exercise, you will use the <code>if</code> statement to test for an even number between 1 and 6 and test the results in your web browser console window. Let's get started:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <code>if-statement.html</code> document in your web browser.</li>
				<li>Open the web developer console window using your web browser.</li>
				<li>Open the <code>if-statement.js</code> document in your code editor, replace all of its content with the following code, and then save it:<pre>var diceValue = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
console.log("Dice value:", diceValue);
if(diceValue % 2 != 0){
console.log("Is an odd number.");
}</pre></li>
				<li>The <code>Math.random()</code> function randomly creates a whole number from <code>1</code> to <code>6</code> and displays it in the console. Here, the <code>if</code> statement states that if the remainder of the number, divided by two, is not zero, that is, <code>diceValue % 2 != 0</code>, then the <code>if</code> expression is true and the <code>console.log()</code> message is displayed in the console.</li>
				<li>Reload the <code>if-statement.html</code> web page in your web browser with the console window open. Repeat until you see a version of the two examples:<pre>// Example of output if the number is odd.
  Dice value: 3
  Is an odd number.
// Example of output if the number is even.
  Dice value: 4</pre></li>
				<li>Edit the <code>if-statement.js</code> document using bolded lines and then save it:<pre>var diceValue = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;
console.log("Dice value:", diceValue);
console.log("Is an odd number.");
}</pre><p>Because there is only one line of code in the <code>if</code> statement, the block brackets are not required.</p></li>
				<li>Reload the <code>if-statement.html</code> web page in your web browser with the console window open. You should expect the same results.</li>
				<li>Edit the <code>if-statement.js</code> document and add the highlighted line to <code>console.log()</code> and save it:<pre>var diceValue = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
console.log("Dice value:", diceValue);
if(diceValue % 2 != 0)
console.log("Is an odd number.");
console.log('"You have to be odd to be number one", Dr. Seuss');</pre></li>
				<li>Reload the <code>if-statement.html</code> web page in your web browser with the console window open:<pre>// Example of output if the number is odd.
  Dice value: 3
  Is an odd number.
  "You have to be odd to be number one", Dr. Seuss
// Example of output if the number is even.
  Dice value: 2

				<li>Edit the <code>if-statement.js</code> document lines in bold and save it. We added the block delimiters here:<pre>console.log("Is an odd number.");
console.log('"You have to be odd to be number one", Dr. Seuss');
}</pre></li>
				<li>Reload the <code>if-statement.html</code> web page in your web browser with the console window open:<pre>// Example of output if the number is odd. The Dr. Seuss quote is included when the value is an odd number.

// Example of output if the number is even. The Dr. Seuss quote is skipped when the value is an even number.
  Dice value: 2</pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>You can see different outcomes depending on the logical expression of the <code>if </code>statement.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-104"><a id="_idTextAnchor112"/>if Statement and else Statement</h3>
			<p>You can combine an <code>if</code> statement with an <code>else</code> statement. If the expression evaluates to <code>true</code>, the code in the <code>if</code> statement is processed and the code in the <code>else</code> statement is skipped. If the expression is false, the reverse happens; that is, the code in the <code>if</code> statement is skipped and the code in the <code>else</code> statement is processed. The syntax is as follows:</p>
			<pre>if(boolean expression){
   //Statement
   //Statement
   //Statement
}else{
   //Statement
   //Statement
   //Statement

			<p>In this exercise, a random number is being used for a coin toss. A random value equal to .5 or greater is heads and less than .5 is tails. We will assume that multiple statement lines are required for each case. Let's get started:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <code>if-else-statements.html</code> document in your web browser.</li>
				<li>Open the web developer console window using your web browser.</li>

console.log("Random toss value:", tossValue);
if(tossValue&gt;= .5){
  console.log("Heads");
}</pre><p>The <code>tossValue</code> variable is a value from 0 to 1, not including 1. For now, just an <code>else</code> statement is used for a head toss.</p></li>
				<li>Reload the <code>if-else-statements.html</code> web page in your web browser with the console window open. Repeat until you see a version of the two examples:<pre>// Example of output if the number is .5 or greater.

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-106"><a id="_idTextAnchor114"/>if Statements with Multiple else...if Statements</h3>
			<p>You can have one or more <code>else...if</code> statements in addition to the <code>if</code> statement. The <code>if</code> statement and each <code>else...if</code> statement has its own expression. If the code in the first statement has an expression evaluated as <code>true</code>, it is processed and the code in all the other statements is skipped.

			<p>In this exercise, we will build a simple game that generates four random game numbers from 1 to 21 inclusive. One is the player's score, one is the target score, one is a lucky score, and the last is an unlucky score. The player gets a wallet of 20 times the player's score. There are five possible outcomes, with each assigning different wins or losses to the player's wallet:</p>

			<p>This was a much longer exercise. It showed you how multiple <code>if</code> statements with different logic expressions can work together to produce one outcome. You will have noticed that the order of the logical expressions can make a difference because in this case, the lucky and unlucky values needed to be resolved before the target value expressions. Changing the order would produce a whole set of different outcomes.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-109"><a id="_idTextAnchor117"/>The break Statement</h3>
			<p>The <code>break</code> statement is used within blocks for <code>loop</code> statements and the <code>switch</code> statements. When the <code>break</code> statement is encountered inside <code>loop</code> statement and <code>switch</code> statement blocks, program flow continues on the next line following the block. The syntax is as follows:</p>
			<pre>break
break label</pre>
			<p>The second syntax form is required when it's used within a labeled statement block. You will find out more about labeled statements later in this chapter. The upcoming exercises will make use of the <code>break</code> statement.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-110"><a id="_idTextAnchor118"/>switch Statement</h3>
			<p>The <code>switch</code> statement defines a block of code divided up by <code>case</code> statements and an optional <code>default</code> statement. The <code>case</code> statements are followed by a possible value for the <code>switch</code> statement expression and then a colon, <code>:</code>. Optionally, the code will follow a <code>case</code> statement. The <code>default</code> statement is just followed by a colon, <code>:</code>.</p>
			<p>How does it work? The <code>switch</code> statement's expression is evaluated and the code following the first <code>case</code> statement that has a value that matches the <code>switch</code> statement's expression value is processed until a <code>break</code> statement is reached. Then, any remaining code is skipped. If none of the <code>case</code> statement values match and there is a <code>default</code> statement, then the code following the <code>default</code> statement is processed. Otherwise, no code is processed. The syntax is as follows:</p>
			<pre>switch(expression){
   case expression_value:      
      //Optional statement(s)   
      break; //optional        
   case expression_value:      
     //Optional statement(s)   
      break; //optional        
   default:      
      //Statement(s)            
}</pre>
			<p>The following is a flowchart illustrating the <code>switch</code> statement:</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-111"><a id="_idTextAnchor119"/>Exercise 3.08: Writing a switch Statement and Testing It</h2>
			<p>We are going to use the <code>switch</code> statement by simulating a game where the player can move their playing pieces using their keyboard. They can move left with the <code>A</code> key, right with the <code>S</code> key, up with the <code>W</code> key, and down with the <code>Z</code> key. To simulate a random selection of the keys, in either uppercase or lowercase, from the <code>keyNames</code> string, a variable will be used. Let's get started:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <code>switch-statement.html</code> document in your web browser. </li>
				<li>Open the web developer console window using your web browser.</li>
				<li>Open the <code>switch-statement.js</code> document in your code editor, replace all of its content with the following code, and then save it:<pre>var keyNames = "WASDwasd";
var keyName = keyNames.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * keyNames.length));
console.log("keyName:", keyName);</pre><p>The <code>Math.floor(Math.random() * keys.length)</code> expression is selecting a number from <code>0</code> to <code>7</code> that is then used by <code>charAt</code> to select the character from the <code>keyNames</code> string variable.</p></li>
				<li>Run a few tests by reloading the <code>switch-statement.html</code> web page in your web browser with the console window open. Your results will show selections from the <code>ADWSadws</code> characters. Here are some examples of the console output:<pre>keyName: a
keyName: S</pre></li>
				<li>Edit the <code>switch-statement.js</code> document so that it includes the following bolded lines and then save it. <p>The <code>switch</code> statement expression is as follows:</p><pre>console.log("keyName:", keyName); 
switch (keyName.toLowerCase()){</pre><p>The <code>switch</code> statement expression converts the character into lowercase so that each case statement can check for one value. Here, we are checking whether the case value is equal to the switch term:</p><pre> case "a":
  console.log("move left"); //This block will execute when break; // keyName is a
 case "d":
  console.log("move right");//This block will execute when break; // keyName is d
 case "w":
  console.log("move up");//This block will execute when break; // keyName is w
 case "s":
  console.log("move down");//This block will execute when break; // keyName is s
  
}</pre><p>The <code>switch</code> statement uses one expression and then determines the lines of code to process based on matching the result with the case statements. It is important to note that without a <code>break</code> statement, all the code to the end of the <code>switch</code> statement is processed once one case statement matches the expression value. This can be an advantage when more than one case statement uses the same code. The default statement allows for code that is being processed when none of the case statements match the expression value. However, remember that a default statement is not required. In this example, if the user pressed a wrong key, nothing would happen, which is often the case with game consoles.</p></li>
				<li>Reload the <code>switch-statement.html</code> web page in your web browser with the console window open. The following are some sample results:<pre>keyName: S
move down
keyName: d
move right</pre><p>Let's use the <code>IJKL</code> keys to perform the same tasks. We'll use the <code>I</code> key for up, the <code>J</code> key for left, the <code>K</code> key for right, and the <code>M</code> key for down.</p><p>Edit the <code>switch-statement.js</code> document, include the following bolded lines and save it. </p><p>First, add the new key letters:</p><pre>var keyNames = "WASDwasdIJKMijkm"; </pre><p>Next, add the case statements for each:</p><pre> case "a":
 case "j":
  console.log("move left");
  break;
 case "d":
 case "k":
  console.log("move right");
  break;
 case "w":
 case "i":
  console.log("move up");
  break;
 case "s":
 case "m":
  console.log("move down");
  break;
}</pre><p>When case statements are not followed by a break, the next case statement's code is also processed.</p></li>
				<li>Reload the <code>switch-statement.html</code> web page in your web browser with the console window open. The following are some sample results:<pre>keyName: J
move left
keyName: w
move up</pre><p>The simulated code does not generate any keys that are not matched by the <code>case</code> statements. If there were, the entire <code>switch</code> statement is skipped. The <code>switch</code> statement can handle other cases by using the <code>default</code> statement.</p></li>
				<li>Edit the <code>switch-statement.js</code> document, include the following bolded lines, and then save it. First, let's add a few test characters:<pre>var keyNames = "WASDwasdIJKMijkmRTXPrtxp";</pre><p>Next, let's add the <code>default</code> statement:</p><pre> case "m":
  console.log("move down");
  break;
 default:
  console.log("invalid key");
  break;
}</pre></li>
				<li>Reload the <code>switch-statement.html</code> web page in your web browser with the console window open. Repeat this until you see a result indicating an invalid key:<pre>keyName: R
invalid key</pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In this exercise, if the user pressed a wrong key, nothing would happen, which is often the case with game consoles.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-112"><a id="_idTextAnchor120"/>Loop Statements</h2>
			<p>Loop code blocks are also called iterative blocks. They are designed to continue processing the code in their blocks until the <code>loop</code> statement expression becomes false. Iteration is a term that's used to indicate one time through the loop. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">A loop that does not terminate is called an infinite loop. A web browser may display a dialog with the option to terminate long-running loops.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-113"><a id="_idTextAnchor121"/>for Statement</h3>
			<p>The <code>for</code> statement repeats the code until the repeat expression becomes <code>false</code>. The syntax is as follows:</p>
			<pre>for(initialize statement; repeat expression; post expression){
   //Statement
   //Statement
}</pre>
			<p>The following flowchart depicts how the <code>for</code> statement works:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 3.9: for statement flowchart&#13;&#10;" src="img/C14377_03_09.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.9: for statement flowchart</p>
			<p>The first time the <code>for</code> statement is reached, the <code>initialize</code> statement is processed. It normally sets a variable that is used in the repeat expression. The post expression changes a value in the repeat expression. After the last line of code in the loop is processed, the post expression is processed and then the repeat expression is processed. If the repeat expression remains true, the first statement in the loop block is processed again. The post expression often makes use of the arithmetic operators called increment and decrement and the assignment addition and subtraction operators. Some examples of more arithmetic operators are as follows:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 3.10: More arithmetic operators&#13;&#10;" src="img/C14377_03_10.jpg"/>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-114"><a id="_idTextAnchor122"/>Exercise 3.09: Writing a for Loop and Testing It</h2>
			<p>This exercise demonstrates using the <code>for</code> statement to create an increasing counter and decreasing counter. Let's get started:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <code>for-statement.html</code> document in your web browser. </li>
				<li>Open the web developer console window using your web browser.</li>
				<li>Open the <code>for-statement.js</code> document in your code editor, replace all of its content with the following code, and then save it:<pre>for(var i = 1; i&lt;= 5; i++){
 console.log(i);
}</pre><p>This example is an incrementing counter loop. The <code>initialize</code> statement declares the <code>i</code> variable and assigns it a value of <code>1</code>. This is the value it has on the first iteration of the loop. At the end of the loop, the repeat expression is evaluated and, if true, the line following the loop is processed. The post expression uses the increment operator to increase the <code>i 1</code> variable at the end of each loop.</p></li>
				<li>Reload the <code>for-statement.html</code> web page in your web browser with the <code>console window</code> open. The following are the results:<pre>1
2

5</pre></li>
				<li>Edit the <code>for-statement.js</code> document using the following bolded lines and then save it:<pre>for(var i = 5; i&gt;= 1; i--){
 console.log(i);
}</pre><p>This example illustrates a decreasing counter loop. In this example, the post expression uses the decrement operator. The repeat expression is changed to be true until the <code>i</code> variable values are <code>1</code> or less. The <code>initialize</code> statement declares the <code>i</code> variable and sets it to <code>5</code>.</p></li>
				<li>Reload the <code>for-statement.html</code> web page in your web browser with the console window open. The following are the results:<pre>5

			<p>The <code>for</code> loop is the workhorse for repeating code for a counted number of iterations. You will find greater use for it by iterating through arrays.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-115"><a id="_idTextAnchor123"/>do...while Statement</h3>
			<p>The <code>do...while</code> statement is a loop that executes code until the repeat expression value becomes false. The repeat expression is evaluated after all the statements have been processed, resulting in the guarantee that they are processed once. The syntax is as follows:</p>
			<pre>do{
   //Statement
   //Statement
} while(repeat expression
do
   //Single statement
while(repeat expression)</pre>
			<p>A semicolon needs to be at the end of the <code>while</code> line if you are using it elsewhere.</p>

 var die2 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
 console.log("Die 1:", die1, "Die 2:", die2);
}while(die1 != die2);</pre><p>The second and third lines each compute a random number from <code>1</code> to <code>6</code> and store it in a variable. Those variables are displayed on the third line. These lines are always executed once. The <code>while</code> condition is true if the values of the <code>die1</code> and <code>die2</code> variables are not equal. If the values are equal, the expression is false and the loop repeats. If the values are not equal, any statements that follow the <code>do…while</code> loop are processed.</p></li>
				<li>Run a few tests by reloading the <code>do-while-statements.html</code> web page in your web browser with the <code>console window</code> open. Your results will differ due to the random values.<p>The following is an example result of more than one iteration:</p><pre>Die 1: 1 Die 2: 3

			<p>In this exercise, we will use the <code>while</code> loop to simulate how many dice rolls it takes to roll an even number. Let's get started:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <code>while-statement.html</code> document in your web browser. </li>
				<li>Open the web developer console window using your web browser.</li>
				<li>Open the <code>while-statement.js</code> document in your code editor, replace all of its content with the following code, and then save it:<pre>let iterations = 0;
while (iterations &lt;10){
 console.log("iterations:", iterations);
 iterations ++;
}</pre><p>This is just the initial shell for a <code>while</code> loop that repeats 10 times. The <code>while</code> loop's repeat expression is true if the <code>iterations</code> variable is below the value of <code>10</code>. The first time the expression is evaluated, the <code>iterations</code> variable is <code>0</code>. Inside the <code>while</code> loop, the <code>iterations</code> variable is incremented by <code>1</code> on the first line and will increase from <code>0</code> to <code>9</code> on each iteration of the loop.</p></li>
				<li>Reload the <code>while-statement.html</code> web page in your web browser with the <code>console window</code> open.<p>The results show the <code>iterations</code> variable increasing from <code>0</code> to <code>9</code> for <code>10</code> iterations:</p><pre>iterations: 0
iterations: 1
iterations: 2
iterations: 3
iterations: 4
iterations: 5
iterations: 6
iterations: 7
iterations: 8
iterations: 9</pre></li>
				<li>Edit the <code>while-statement.js</code> document using the following bolded lines and then save it. This adds the line to show a dice roll for each iteration:<pre> die = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
 console.log("die:", die);
 iterations ++;</pre></li>
				<li>Reload the <code>while-statement.html</code> web page in your web browser with the console window open.</li>
				<li>You will see a list of 10 dice values. Your values will differ:<pre>die: 2
die: 5
die: 2
die: 4
die: 2
die: 3
die: 4
die: 2
die: 6
die: 1</pre></li>
				<li>Edit the <code>while-statement.js</code> document using the following bolded lines and then save it.<p>This adds an <code>if</code> block to test for an even number of the dice roll. If <code>true</code>, the <code>break</code> statement terminates the <code>while</code> loop and the line following it is processed. The two lines following the <code>while</code> loop display how many iterations occurred and the value of the dice roll for that iteration:</p><pre>let die;
while (iterations &lt;10){
 die = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
 if (die % 2 == 0){
  break;
 }
 iterations ++;
}
console.log("Number of iterations: ", iterations + 1);
console.log("Die value: ", die);</pre></li>
				<li>Run a few tests by reloading the <code>while-statement.html</code> web page in your web browser with the console window open:<pre>Number of iterations:  1
Die value:  2</pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The <code>while-loop</code> use a Boolean expression to determine whether any iterations of the code it contains occurred. In this case, if the iterations variable was greater than 10, no iterations would have occurred. </p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-119"><a id="_idTextAnchor127"/>for...in Statement</h3>
			<p>The <code>for...in</code> statement allows us to iterate over an object data type. The variable in the <code>for</code> expression holds one of the names of the name-value pairs of the object, which are the names of the properties and methods of the object. The syntax is as follows:</p>
			<pre>for (variable in object){
   //Statement
   //Statement
}
for (variable in object)
   //Single statement</pre>
			<p>You can declare the variable with <code>const</code>, <code>var</code>, or <code>let</code>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-120"><a id="_idTextAnchor128"/>Exercise 3.12: Writing a for...in Loop and Testing It</h2>
			<p>This exercise applies the for...in loop to the ready-made location object and to a programmer-created object. You can access object names and values by using them. Let's get started:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <code>for-in-statement.html</code> document in your web browser. </li>
				<li>Open the web developer console window using your web browser.</li>
				<li>Open the <code>for-in-statement.js</code> document in your code editor, replace all of its content with the following code, and then save it:<pre>for (let name in location) {
 console.log(name);
};</pre><p>This iterates the web browser-created <code>location</code> object.</p></li>
				<li>Reload the <code>for-in-statement.html</code> web page in your web browser with the console window open.<p>The following output shows the names of all the <code>location</code> object's properties and methods:</p><pre>replace

ancestorOrigins
origin
protocol
host

				<li>Edit the <code>for-in-statement.js</code> document, add the following bolded text, and then save it:<pre>for (let name in location) {
 console.log(name, ":", location[name]);
};</pre><p>This will add the value of the property or method.</p></li>
				<li>Reload the <code>for-in-statement.html</code> web page in your web browser with the console window open. The values may differ, assuming the web page was opened from a local file folder and not using http or https:<pre>replace : ƒ () { [native code] }

				<li>Edit the <code>for-in-statement.js</code> document, replace it with the following code, and then save it:<pre>var stopWatch = {
 elapsedTime: 0,
 resultsHistory: [],
 isTiming: true,
 isPaused: true,
 start: function(){console.log("start");},
 pause: function(){console.log("pause");},
 resume: function(){console.log("resume");},
 stop: function(){console.log("stop");}
};</pre></li>
				<li>Below that, add the following code so that we can iterate through the object:<pre>for (const name in stopWatch) {
 console.log(name, ":", stopWatch[name]);
};</pre></li>
				<li>Reload the <code>for-in-statement.html</code> web page in your web browser with the console window open. <p>The following is an example of the output in the console window:</p><pre>elapsedTime : 0

<strong class="bold">stop : ƒ (){console.log("stop");}</strong></pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Looping through the methods and properties of objects can be helpful when the code depends on a specific property or name that needs to be present for it to work. </p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-121"><a id="_idTextAnchor129"/>for...of Statement</h3>
			<p>The <code>for...of</code> statement focuses on iterable objects. Not all objects are iterable. Although we will not cover how to create our own iterable objects, there are some ready-made iterable objects that you may find the <code>for∙∙∙of</code> block useful for. The syntax is as follows:</p>
			<pre><strong class="bold">for (variable of object){</strong>
   //Statement
   //Statement
}
for (variable of object)
   //Single statement</pre>
			<p>You can declare the variable with <code>const</code>, <code>var</code>, or <code>let</code>.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-122"><a id="_idTextAnchor130"/>Exercise 3.13: Writing a for...of Loop and Testing It</h3>
			<p>This exercise uses the <code>for...of</code> statement, which is designed for iterable objects. You will learn how some objects may not be iterable objects and generate errors. For iterable objects, arrays and strings are used. Let's get started:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <code>for-of-statement.html</code> document in your web browser. </li>
				<li>Open the web developer console window using your web browser.</li>
				<li>Open the <code>for-of-statement.js</code> document in your code editor, replace all of its content with the following code, and then save it:<pre>var stopWatch = {

 resultsHistory: [],
 isTiming: true,
 isPaused: true,
 start: function(){console.log("start");},
 pause: function(){console.log("pause");},
 resume: function(){console.log("resume");},
 stop: function(){console.log("stop");}
};</pre></li>
				<li>Below that, add the following code so that we can iterate through the object:<pre>for (let name of stopWatch) {
 console.log(name, ":", stopWatch[name]);
};</pre></li>
				<li>Reload the <code>for-of-statement.html</code> web page in your web browser with the console window open. <p>An error will occur. We need to code the object so that it's iterable for it to work; however, we are not learning how to do that at this point:</p><pre>Uncaught TypeError: stopWatch is not iterable</pre></li>
				<li>Edit the <code>for-of-statement.js</code> document in your code editor, replace all of its content with the following code, and then save it.<p>A string turns out to be iterable:</p><pre>let anyString = 'abcxyz123';
for (const value of anyString) {
 console.log(value);
}</pre></li>
				<li>Reload the <code>for-of-statement.html</code> web page in your web browser with the console window open:<pre>a

				<li>Edit the <code>for-of-statement.js</code> document in your code editor, make the changes shown in bold in the following code, and then save it.<p>A string turns out to be iterable:</p><pre>let anyString = 'abcxyz123';
/*

}
*/
for (var i = 0; i&lt;anyString.length; i++) {
 console.log(anyString.charAt(i));
}</pre></li>
				<li>Reload the <code>for-of-statement.html</code> web page in your web browser with the console window open. You will get the same results. The advantage of the <code>for of</code> loop is that it is more streamlined:<pre>a

			<p>Looping through the methods and properties of objects can be helpful when the code depends on a specific property or name that needs to be present for it to work.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-123"><a id="_idTextAnchor131"/>continue Statement</h3>
			<p>The <code>continue</code> statement stops execution inside a loop or a labeled loop for the current iteration and starts the execution of the next loop iteration. The <code>loop</code> statements then determine whether another iteration should occur. The syntax is as follows:</p>
			<pre>continue
continue label</pre>
			<p>The second syntax is for use within a labeled statement block. We will learn more about labeled statements later in this chapter.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-124"><a id="_idTextAnchor132"/>Labeled Statement</h3>
			<p>The <code>Labeled</code> statement is used to create loop flows and conditional flows. It names either <code>block</code> statements or <code>loop</code> statements. The syntax is as follows:</p>
			<pre>label : {
   //Statement
   //Statement
}
label : loop statement</pre>
			<p>When a <code>loop</code> statement is named, the statements are processed until a <code>break</code> statement or <code>continue</code> statement is encountered inside the block that references the label. </p>
			<p>When a <code>break</code> statement is encountered, the program flow continues on the line after the labeled statement block referenced by the <code>break</code> statement. If a <code>continue</code> statement is encountered, the program flow continues on the first line of the block referenced by the <code>continue</code> statement. A <code>continue</code> statement requires the labeled statement to be a loop. Both <code>break</code> statements and <code>continue</code> statements must appear within the labeled statement block that they reference. They cannot appear outside the labeled statement block that they reference. They can appear in nested labeled blocks and reference outer labeled blocks. Labeled statements are less commonly used because they are prone to creating confusing or difficult to follow program flow.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">It is good practice to avoid or find ways to eliminate all labeled statements from code. Conditional statements and dividing code into functions or object methods are alternatives to labeled statements.</p>
			<p>Let's have a look at an example of using a labeled loop statement. The loop labels the <code>for</code> statement, which runs 10 iterations. Each iteration generates a random number from <code>1 to 12</code>. If the number is even, the <code>continue</code> statement starts the beginning of the <code>for</code> statement:</p>
			<pre>console.log("Odd number count started!");
let oddsCount = 0;
odd_number:
 for (let i = 1; i&lt;= 10; i++){
  console.log("Iteration:", i);
  var number = Math.floor(Math.random() * 12) + 1;
  if (number % 2 == 0){
   continue odd_number;
  }
  oddsCount ++;
  console.log("Number:", number);
 }
console.log(oddsCount + " odd numbers found!");</pre>
			<p>The output of the preceding code snippet is as follows:</p>
			<pre>Odd number count started!
Iteration: 1
Iteration: 2
Iteration: 3
Iteration: 4
Number: 7
Iteration: 5
Iteration: 6
Number: 5
Iteration: 7
Iteration: 8
Iteration: 9
Number: 3
3 odd numbers found!</pre>
			<p>The label can be eliminated with a better use of the <code>if</code> statement to achieve the same result:</p>
			<pre>console.log("Odd number count started!");
let oddsCount = 0;
for (let i = 1; i&lt;= 10; i++){
 console.log("Iteration:", i);
 var number = Math.floor(Math.random() * 12) + 1;
 if (number % 2 != 0){
  oddsCount ++;
  console.log("Number:", number);
 }
}
console.log(oddsCount + " odd numbers found!");</pre>
			<p>The output is the same, but with different values: </p>
			<pre>Odd number count started!
Iteration: 1
Iteration: 2
Number: 9
Iteration: 3
Number: 5
Iteration: 4
Iteration: 5
Number: 5
Iteration: 6
Iteration: 7
Number: 9
Iteration: 8
Iteration: 9
Number: 1
Iteration: 10
Number: 7
6 odd numbers found!</pre>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-125"><a id="_idTextAnchor133"/>Writing and Invoking Functions</h1>
			<p>Functions are the basic building blocks when it comes to writing JavaScript programs. A function is one or more statements that can optionally receive data input and provide data output. The statements in a function are not used until the function is invoked. Invoking a function is also known as calling the function.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-126"><a id="_idTextAnchor134"/>Defining Functions</h2>
			<p>JavaScript offers a few ways to define a function. We are going to look at function declarations, function expressions, and arrow function expressions as ways to define a function.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-127"><a id="_idTextAnchor135"/>Function Declaration</h3>
			<p>You can define a function as a statement. This is called a function definition or declaration. The syntax is as follows:</p>
			<pre>function name(optional parameter list) {
   //Statements
   //Optional return statement
}</pre>
			<p>It starts a line of code with the function keyword. It is followed by a name. The name is how the function will appear in other code. The list of comma-separated parameters are names for the input values to a function. Parameters are essentially variables within the function. They are enclosed in parentheses. The block statement then contains the code. Once a function is declared, it can be invoked either on a line of code by itself or within an expression. In the case of its use in an expression, the function typically returns data.</p>
			<p>When a JavaScript function is declared as a statement, it can be invoked by statements that appear before it. This is called hoisting. </p>
			<p>Let's have a look at an example of defining and invoking a function declaration. This example has no parameters and returns the value of a single dice roll:</p>
			<pre>function getDiceRollValue(){
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
}</pre>
			<p>Since it returns a value, we can use it as an expression. Here is an example where it is used in an addition expression to get the roll value of two dice:</p>
			<pre>var rollValue = getDiceRollValue() + getDiceRollValue();</pre>
			<p>We could improve the function so that it returns the value of a set number of dice by creating a parameter. Here, the parameter is the number of dice being rolled:</p>
			<pre>function getDiceRoll(numberOfDice){
 var rollValue = 0;
 for (let i = 1; i&lt;= numberOfDice; i++){
  rollValue += Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
 }
 return rollValue;
}</pre>
			<p>The revised expression to invoke for simulating a two-dice roll just requires us to pass the parameter values. In this example, the parameter is expressed as a number literal:</p>
			<pre>var rollValue = getDiceRollValue(2);</pre>
			<p>In this example, the parameter is expressed as a variable:</p>
			<pre>var numberOfDice = 2;
var rollValue = getDiceRollValue(numberOfDice);</pre>
			<p>Parameters can be optional, otherwise the wrong data can be passed. So, functions often have code that validates the parameter or provides a default value. In this example, the argument of the JavaScript built-in function known as <code>parseInt</code> is used to convert the argument into an integer. Its results are tested using the <code>isNaN</code> built-in function, which returns <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> if the number is not a number or the number is less than <code>1</code>. If any of that is true, the argument value is set to <code>1</code>. If not, the supplied number is passed through:</p>
			<pre>function getDiceRoll(numberOfDice){
 numberOfDice = (isNaN(parseInt(numberOfDice)) || numberOfDice&lt; 1) ?1 :numberOfDice;
 var rollValue = 0;
 for (let i = 1; i&lt;= numberOfDice; i++){
  rollValue += Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
 }
 return rollValue;
}</pre>
			<p>Now, the function always returns a roll of one dice, regardless of an incorrect parameter or no parameter. In both of these examples, the value of the roll of one dice is returned:</p>
			<pre>var rollValue = getDiceRoll();
var rollValue = getDiceRoll("BOGUS");</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-128"><a id="_idTextAnchor136"/>Exercise 3.14: Writing a Function as a Statement and Invoking It</h2>
			<p>This exercise will define a function as a statement and then use it. The function we will create will accept one parameter and return an array. If the parameter can be validated as a number, then each item in the array has one digit from the number starting with the <code>0</code> index item holding the digit for the ones place value, the 1 index item holding the digit for the <code>tens</code> place value, and so on.</p>
			<p>We will use the <code>log</code> method of the <code>console</code> object in this exercise. Remember that a method is a function that belongs to an object, so it can have parameters. The <code>log</code> method takes an unlimited number of parameters. Let's get started:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <code>function-declare.html</code> document in your web browser. </li>
				<li>Open the web developer console window using your web browser.</li>
				<li>Open the <code>function-declare.js</code> document in your code editor, replace all of its content with the following code, and then save it.<p>This declares the function. Its name is <code>getDigitsOfNumber</code>. It has one parameter named <code>num</code>. It returns the <code>digits</code> array:</p><pre>function getDigitsOfNumber(num){
 var digits = [];
 console.log("num:", num);
 return digits;
}</pre></li>
				<li>Reload the <code>function-declare.html</code> web page in your web browser with the console window open.<p>There is no output because the function was not invoked.</p></li>
				<li>Edit the <code>function-declare.js</code> document, add the following bolded text to the end of the file, and then save it. <p>In this example, the function is being expressed and is not being invoked. Invoking a function requires to append parentheses around the function's name:</p><pre> return digits;
} 
console.log("getDigitsOfNumber:", getDigitsOfNumber);</pre></li>
				<li>Reload the <code>function-declare.html</code> web page in your web browser with the console window open.<p>The function is treated as data and is displayed:</p><pre>getDigitsOfNumber: ƒ getDigitsOfNumber(num){
 var digits = [];
 console.log("num:", num);
 return digits;
}</pre></li>
				<li>Edit the <code>function-declare.js</code> document, update it using the following bolded text at the end of the file, and then save it. <p>This invokes the function in an assignment statement to create the <code>test456</code> variable:</p><pre> return digits;
}
var test456 = getDigitsOfNumber(456);
console.log("test456:", test456);</pre><p>This will add the value of the property or method.</p></li>
				<li>Reload the <code>function-declare.html</code> web page in your web browser with the console window open. The first line of output shows the <code>num</code> parameter being displayed when the function was invoked. The second output line is the <code>test456</code> variable being set to the empty array that was returned by the function:<pre>num: 456
test456: =&gt;[]</pre></li>
				<li>Edit the <code>function-declare.js</code> document, add the following bolded text to the beginning of the file, and then save it. This shows invoking the function before it is declared. This demonstrates hoisting:<pre>var test123 = getDigitsOfNumber(123);
console.log("test123:", test123);
function getDigitsOfNumber_1(num){</pre></li>
				<li>Reload the <code>function-declare.html</code> web page in your web browser with the console window open. These are the results for the invocations of the function before and after it was declared:<pre>num: 123
test123: =&gt;[]
num: 456
test456: =&gt;[]</pre></li>
				<li>Edit the <code>function-declare.js</code> document, update it using the following bolded text, and then save it. <p>The second line in the function converts any negative numbers into positive numbers and truncates any decimals. The <code>if</code> statement tests to assure that the <code>num</code> parameter contains a number. The <code>while</code> loop repeats until the <code>num</code> parameter becomes zero. Inside the loop, the ones place value is added to the <code>digits</code> array by dividing by 10 and using the remainder. Then, the ones place value is stripped from the <code>num</code> parameter:</p><pre>function getDigitsOfNumber(num){
 var digits = [];
 num = Math.floor(Math.abs(num));
 if(!isNaN(num)){
  while(num != 0) {
   digits.push(num % 10);
   num = Math.floor(num / 10);
  }
 }
 return digits;
}</pre></li>
				<li>Reload the <code>function-declare.html</code> web page in your web browser with the console window open. <p>Each array shows the test value digits split into arrays. The zero-array index has the ones place value, the one array index has the tens place value, and the two-index position has the hundreds place value:</p><pre>test123: =&gt;(3) [3, 2, 1]
test456: =&gt;(3) [6, 5, 4]</pre></li>
				<li>Edit the <code>function-declare.js</code> document, add the following bolded text to the end of the file, and then save it. You can run various tests on your functions based on the possible inputs and expected outputs. These are a few for you to try.<p>An intermediate variable is not used for these new lines. A function can be used wherever an expression can be used. In these additions, it is used as an expression for a <code>log</code> method parameter:</p><pre>var test456 = getDigitsOfNumber(456);
console.log("test456:", test456);
console.log('5:', getDigitsOfNumber(5));
console.log('4563:', getDigitsOfNumber(4563));
console.log('123.654:', getDigitsOfNumber(123.654));
console.log('-123.654:', getDigitsOfNumber(-123.654));
console.log('"1000"', getDigitsOfNumber("1000"));
console.log('"1,000"', getDigitsOfNumber("1,000"));
console.log('"B37"', getDigitsOfNumber("B37"));
console.log('"37B"', getDigitsOfNumber("37B"));</pre></li>
				<li>Reload the <code>function-declare.html </code>web page in your web browser with the console window open. <p>Here are the outputs. The expected results should be an array with all the digits or an empty array. Evaluate each output and verify that this was the result. If the output was an empty array, determine why:</p><pre>test123: =&gt;(3) [3, 2, 1]
test456: =&gt;(3) [6, 5, 4]
5: =&gt;[5]
4563: =&gt;(4) [3, 6, 5, 4]
123.654: =&gt;(3) [3, 2, 1]
-123.654: =&gt;(3) [3, 2, 1]
"1000" =&gt;(4) [0, 0, 0, 1]
"1,000" =&gt;[]
"B37" =&gt;[]
"37B" =&gt;[]</pre></li>
			</ol>
			<p>In this exercise, we defined a function as a statement that accepts one parameter and return an array. We used the <code>log</code> method of the <code>console</code> object in this exercise.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-129"><a id="_idTextAnchor137"/>Function Expression</h2>
			<p>In this variation, you can define a function as part of an expression. There is no name for the function. However, because a function is a data type, it can be assigned to a variable. The variable can then be used to invoke the function. The syntax is as follows:</p>
			<pre>function(optional parameter list) {
   //Statements
   //Optional return statement
}</pre>
			<p>The syntax is the same, except no function name is needed. A JavaScript function declared as an expression cannot be invoked by statements that appear before it.</p>
			<p>Here is an example of defining and invoking a function expression.</p>
			<p>This example shows the function as part of an assignment expression. The right-hand side of the assignment is the function without a name. The left-hand side is the variable:</p>
			<pre>var getDiceValue = function(){
 return Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
}</pre>
			<p>In this case, the variable can be used to invoke the function:</p>
			<pre>var rollValue = getDiceValue() + getDiceValue();</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-130"><a id="_idTextAnchor138"/>Exercise 3.15: Writing a Function as an Expression and Invoking It</h2>
			<p>This exercise defines a function as an expression and then uses it.</p>
			<p>The function returns a single random character from a string. The string is the function's only parameter. If the parameter is not a string or is an empty string, then an empty string is returned. Let's get started:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <code>function-expression.html</code> document in your web browser. </li>
				<li>Open the web developer console window using your web browser.</li>
				<li>Open the <code>function-expression.js</code> document in your code editor, replace all of its contents with the following code, and then save it.<p>The function, as a literal value, is assigned to the <code>getRandomStringCharacter</code> variable. </p><p>Then, the variable is displayed in the console. Remember, a function is not invoked unless you include parentheses:</p><pre>var getRandomStringCharacter = function(source){
 var returnCharacter = '';
 console.log("source:", source);
 return returnCharacter;
}
console.log('getRandomStringCharacter', getRandomStringCharacter);</pre></li>
				<li>Reload the <code>function-expression.html</code> web page in your web browser with the console window open. The actual function is displayed but not invoked, as expected:<pre>getRandomStringCharacter ƒ (source){
 var returnCharacter = '';
 console.log("source:", source);
 return returnCharacter;
}</pre></li>
				<li>Edit the <code>function-expression.js</code> document, update the lines with the following bolded text, and then save it. <p>Now, we will invoke the function:</p><pre> return returnCharacter;
}
getRandomStringCharacter();
getRandomStringCharacter("AEIOU");</pre></li>
				<li>Reload the <code>function-expression.html</code> web page in your web browser with the console window open. <p>The <code>console.log</code> statement in the function displays the <code>source</code> parameter value for each invocation. No parameter was passed in the first invocation. The <code>source</code> parameter data type is undefined:</p><pre>source: undefined
source: AEIOU</pre></li>
				<li>Edit the <code>function-expression.js</code> document, add the following bolded text above the function, and then save it.<p>Now, we will invoke the function before it is defined:</p><pre>getRandomStringCharacter();
var getRandomStringCharacter = function(source){
 var returnCharacter = '';</pre></li>
				<li>Reload the <code>function-expression.html</code> web page in your web browser with the console window open. <p>You should see an error in the console. Functions that are defined as expressions cannot be invoked before they are defined:</p><pre>Uncaught TypeError: getRandomStringCharacter is not a function
    at function-expression.js:1</pre></li>
				<li>Edit the <code>function-expression.js</code> document, update the bolded text, and then save it. <p>We can remove the line that invokes the function before it is defined and finish coding the function. The <code>if</code> block tests whether the source parameter is not undefined and contains characters. In the <code>if</code> block, the <code>Math.floor(Math.random() * source.length</code> expression finds a random character position as a value from 0 to the length of the <code>source</code> parameter minus 1. The <code>charAt</code> string method extracts the character at that position it will be returned at:</p><pre>var getRandomStringCharacter = function(source){
 if (source !=undefined &amp;&amp;source.length&gt; 0){
  returnCharacter = source.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * source.length));
 }
 return returnCharacter;
}</pre><p>These lines are a set of tests of various source values. The first passes no parameter. The second, third, and fourth pass a string. The fifth is passing a number and the last is passing a Boolean:</p><pre>console.log('():', getRandomStringCharacter());
console.log('("AEIOU"):', getRandomStringCharacter('AEIOU'));
console.log('("JavaScript"):', getRandomStringCharacter('JavaScript'));
console.log('("124678"):', getRandomStringCharacter('124678'));
console.log('(124678):', getRandomStringCharacter(124678));
console.log('(true):', getRandomStringCharacter(true));</pre></li>
				<li>Reload the <code>function-expression.html</code> web page in your web browser with the <code>console</code> window open. <p>The function's output expects a random character in the source parameter. If it is not empty, it will return a string and will return an empty string for all other values. Reload the web page a few times to get different test results:</p><pre>(): 
("AEIOU"): U
("124678"): 6
("JavaScript"): a
(124678): 
(true):</pre></li>
			</ol>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-131"><a id="_idTextAnchor139"/>Arrow Function Expression</h3>
			<p>Arrow functions were introduced in ES6. They are defined similarly in an expression, such as when defining function expressions. They offer syntactically compact alternatives over defining a function expression. There is nothing different in how they are invoked. The <code>=&gt;</code> symbol is the telltale sign of an arrow function being defined. Also, the <code>function</code> keyword is not used. The concise variation, without a function body, can return an expression with or without a <code>return</code> statement. This differs from a function expression, which requires the <code>return</code> statement to return a value. The syntax is as follows:</p>
			<pre>(optional parameter list) =&gt; {
   //Statements
   //Optional return statement
}
(optional parameter list) =&gt; //Expression or return statement</pre>
			<p>Parameter parentheses are optional when a single parameter is named:</p>
			<pre>parameter =&gt; {
   //Statements
   //Optional return statement
}
parameter =&gt; //Expression or return statement</pre>
			<p>Parentheses are required if there is no parameter:</p>
			<pre>() =&gt; {
   //Statements
   //Optional return statement
}
() =&gt;//Expression or return statement</pre>
			<p>JavaScript arrow functions cannot be invoked by statements that appear before it.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-132"><a id="_idTextAnchor140"/>Defining and Invoking an Arrow Function Expression</h3>
			<p>This example shows a single statement arrow function with no parameters. The right-hand side of the assignment is the function without a name. The left-hand side is the variable:</p>
			<pre>var getDiceValue = ()=&gt; Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;</pre>
			<p>In this case, the variable can be used to invoke the function:</p>
			<pre>var rollValue = getDiceValue() + getDiceValue();</pre>
			<p>This example shows a multiple statement arrow function with one parameter. The right-hand side of the assignment is the function without a name. The left-hand side is the variable:</p>
			<pre>var getDiceRoll = (numberOfDice) =&gt; {
 numberOfDice = (isNaN(parseInt(numberOfDice)) || numberOfDice&lt; 1) ?1 :numberOfDice;
 var rollValue = 0;
 for (let i = 1; i&lt;= numberOfDice; i++){
  rollValue += Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
 }
 return rollValue;
}</pre>
			<p>The following is the output of invoking and passing a parameter:</p>
			<pre>var rollValue = getDiceRoll(2);</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-133"><a id="_idTextAnchor141"/>Exercise 3.16: Writing an Arrow Function and Invoking It</h2>
			<p>This exercise will show you how to convert a function expression into an arrow function. The JavaScript file we'll be using already contains the function. Let's get started:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <code>function-arrow.html</code> document in your web browser. </li>
				<li>Open the web developer <code>console window</code> using your web browser.</li>
				<li>Reload the <code>function-arrow.html</code> web page in your web browser with the <code>console window</code> open.<p>The first, second from last, and last results are an empty string. The second, third, and fourth results show a random character from the string:</p><pre>():

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-134"><a id="_idTextAnchor142"/>Reacting to User Input Events and Updating the DOM</h1>
			<p>JavaScript is used to interact with the DOM. This entails responding to DOM-generated events such as a user clicking a button. It also entails updating content and HTML elements, such as displaying a notification message.</p>
			<p>Elements in the DOM are objects. The <code>document</code> object that's provided by JavaScript contains the element objects. It also contains methods for accessing the elements and updating them.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-135"><a id="_idTextAnchor143"/>The DOM HTML Element Object</h2>
			<p>The HTML elements are represented as objects. Since they are objects, there are methods and properties we can use for them. These properties and methods are inherited from a hierarchy of DOM objects that are provided by the web browser, starting with an object called <code>Node</code>. For example, the <code>ol</code> element shares methods and properties from the following hierarchy of DOM objects:</p>
			<pre>Node⇒Element⇒HTMLElement⇒HTMLOListElement</pre>
			<p>It is not necessary to understand all the objects involved, but it is good to be aware of them. It's better to learn about some of the properties and methods that are derived from all of those objects. The following are a few of the properties and methods that are inherited from a hierarchy of DOM elements above it:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>innerHTML</code>: With the source element, this is the HTML and content contained in an element.</li>
				<li><code>innerText</code>: With the source HTMLElement, this is the rendered text of an element.</li>
				<li><code>addEventListener(</code>…<code>)</code>: With the source element event target, this is used to register a function to respond to events such as a user clicking on the element.</li>
				<li><code>appendChild(</code>…<code>)</code>: With the source node, this adds a node to a parent node; for example, to add an <code>li</code> element to the end of an <code>ol</code> element, or to add a <code>p</code> element to the end of a <code>div</code> element.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-136"><a id="_idTextAnchor144"/>Getting Access to Elements in the DOM</h2>
			<p>The following are <code>document</code> objects that contain methods that we can use to get one or more <code>HTMLElemen</code>t objects from the DOM:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>getElementById(element-id)</code>: The element ID is the ID attribute of the element. Returned as an HTMLElement object.</li>
				<li><code>getElementsByTagName(element-name)</code>: The element name is the static name of HTML elements such as <code>body, div, p, footer, ol, and ul</code>. This returns a <code>NodeList</code> object. A <code>NodeList</code> object is similar to an array of objects.</li>
				<li><code>getElementsByClassName(css-class-name)</code>: The css class name is the class attribute of the elements. This returns a <code>NodeList</code> object. A <code>NodeList</code> object is similar to an array of objects.</li>
				<li><code>querySelector(selectors)</code>: The selectors are like the selectors that are used in CSS. This returns an HTMLElement object for the first element that's matched.</li>
				<li><code>querySelectorAll(selectors)</code>: The selectors are like the selectors that are used in CSS. This returns a <code>NodeList</code> object. A <code>NodeList </code>object is similar to an array of objects for each element that's matched.</li>
				<li><code>createElement(tag name)</code>: This creates an <code>HTMLElement</code> object for the HTML tag name that's supplied.</li>
				<li><code>createTextNode(data)</code>: This creates a <code>Text</code> object that can be placed inside an HTML element, for example, inside an <code>h1</code> or a <code>p</code> element. The data argument is a string.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following is an example of the <code>document</code> object's <code>getElementById</code> method being used to access a DOM element. This creates an object from an element DOM that has the <code>id</code> attribute of <code>user-id</code>:</p>
			<pre>let userIdEle = getElementById("user-id");</pre>
			<p>This is an example of the <code>document</code> object's <code>getElementByTagName</code> method being used to access DOM elements. This creates a collection of objects representing all the <code>div</code> elements in the document. Further steps are needed to access each element, such as a loop:</p>
			<pre>let divEles = getElementByTagName("div");</pre>
			<p>This creates a collection of objects representing all the elements that use the <code>notice</code> class in the document. Further steps are needed to access each element, such as a loop:</p>
			<pre>let noticeEles = getElementByClassName("notice");</pre>
			<p>This is an example of the <code>document</code> object's <code>getElementByClassName</code> method being used to access DOM elements. This creates a collection of objects representing all the elements that use the <code>notice</code> class in the document. Further steps are needed to access each element, such as a loop:</p>
			<pre>let noticeEles = getElementByClassName("notice");</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-137"><a id="_idTextAnchor145"/>Creating Elements and Content in the DOM</h2>
			<p>You may want JavaScript to add HTML elements and content to a web page. This is done by updating the DOM. The <code>document</code> object has two methods that are useful for this:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>createElement(tag name)</code>: Creates an <code>HTMLElement</code> object for the HTML tag name that's supplied.</li>
				<li><code>createTextNode(data)</code>: Creates a text object that can be placed inside an HTML element, for example, inside an <code>h1</code> or a <code>p</code> element. The data argument is a string.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following is an example of the <code>document</code> object's <code>createElement</code> method being used to create an <code>li</code> element:</p>
			<pre>let liEle = document.createElement("li");</pre>
			<p>The following is an example of the <code>document</code> object's <code>createTextNode</code> method being used to create a <code>Milk Moon</code> element:</p>
			<pre>let elementTextNode = document.createTextNode("Milk Moon");</pre>
			<p>Putting this all together, we can append elements and text nodes to the DOM. Consider the following HTML list of names for the November full moons:</p>
			<pre>&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Flower Moon&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Planting Moon&lt;/li&gt;
/ul&gt;</pre>
			<p>Suppose we want to append another <code>li</code> element to the Milk Moon. To do that, we use the <code>document</code> object's <code>createElement</code> method to create an <code>li</code> element:</p>
			<pre>let liEle = document.createElement("li");</pre>
			<p>The <code>createElement</code> method returns an <code>HTMLElement</code> object. It provides the <code>appendChild</code> method, which we can use in this instance. For the <code>appendChild</code> method argument, the <code>document</code> object's <code>createTextNode</code> method can supply the required text node:</p>
			<pre>liEle.appendChild(document.createTextNode("Milk Moon"));</pre>
			<p>The resulting DOM is as follows:</p>
			<pre>&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Flower Moon&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Planting Moon&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Milk Moon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>
			<p>Let's take this a bit further and assume that we have a list of full moon names in an array:</p>
			<pre>let mayMoons = [
 "Flower Moon",
 "Planting Moon",
 "Milk Moon"
];</pre>
			<p>Now, we want to use the array to populate a <code>ul</code> element that has the <code>id</code> attribute of <code>full-moons</code>: </p>
			<pre>&lt;ul id ="full-moons"&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Grass Moon&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Egg Moon&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Pink Moon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>
			<p>First, you may want to remove the existing <code>li</code> elements from the <code>u</code>l element. You can do that by using the <code>document.getElementById</code> method and the <code>innerHTML</code> property of the element:</p>
			<pre>let moonsEle = document.getElementById("full-moons");
moonsEle.innerHTML = "";</pre>
			<p>Next, we can loop through the array, appending <code>li</code> elements to the moon names:</p>
			<pre>for (let i= 0; i&lt;= mayMoons.length - 1; i++){
 let liEle = document.createElement("li");
 liEle.appendChild(document.createTextNode(mayMoons.length[i]));
 listEle.appendChild(liEle);
}</pre>
			<p>The resulting DOM is as follows:</p>
			<pre>&lt;ul id ="full-moons"&gt;
 li&gt;Flower Moon&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Planting Moon&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Milk Moon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-138"><a id="_idTextAnchor146"/>DOM Events</h2>
			<p>Events are messages that you can provide to code so that it can handle it; for example, the user clicking a button on an HTML page. The document model objects use the <code>addEventListener</code> method to add your code so that it is processed when the event occurs. The syntax is as follows:</p>
			<pre>target.addEventListener(event-type, listener)</pre>
			<p>The target is an object that has the <code>addEventListener</code> method. Objects representing elements in the DOM have this method.</p>
			<p>The event type parameter is a predefined name for the event. For example, <code>click</code> is the name for a mouse click event. The listener is an object that has the ability to "listen" to events. Functions are objects that can "listen" to events. Functions that are used as event listeners have one parameter, which is an <code>Event</code> object.</p>
			<p>For example, the <code>addEventListener</code> method for a click event that uses a function literal can be written as follows:</p>
			<pre>helpButtonEle.addEventListener("click", function(e){
 console.log("Something was clicked");
}</pre>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-139"><a id="_idTextAnchor147"/>Exercise 3.17: Working with DOM Manipulation and Events</h2>
			<p>This exercise will accept an input value from a web page that aims to guess a number from 1 to 10. A button is used to check the input value against a random number that's generated from 1 to 10. Depending on whether there's a match, the <code>display</code> property of the other elements on the web page is toggled to hide or show the element. Also, the number that's generated is displayed on the page. Let's get started:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the <code>number-guess.html</code> document in your web browser. </li>
				<li>Open the web developer console window using your web browser.</li>
				<li>First, we can start with the web browser <code>document</code> object.</li>
				<li>Type the items on the lines beginning with the <code>&gt;</code> symbol. The console window will show a response on the lines beginning with the <code>&lt;·</code> symbol.</li>
				<li>Open the <code>number-guess.html</code> document in your code editor.<p>Let's review some of the elements that will be accessed in JavaScript. First is the <code>input</code> element, which is used for entering the guess value. Note that its <code>id</code> attribute value is <code>number-guessed</code>. We are going to use the <code>id</code> attributes to get access to all the elements we use in JavaScript: </p><pre>&lt;input id="number-guessed" type="text" maxlength="2"&gt;</pre><p>The next is the <code>button</code> element. The <code>id</code> attribute is <code>test-button</code>:</p><pre>&lt;button id="test-button"&gt;Test Your Guess&lt;/button&gt;</pre><p>The next is the <code>p</code> element. The <code>id</code> attribute is <code>results-msg</code>. This is the container for all the result messages. It has a <code>class</code> value of <code>hidden</code>. The <code>number-guess.css</code> file has the <code>display</code> property set to <code>none</code> for the <code>hidden</code> class: </p><pre>.hidden{
 display:none;
}</pre><p>When the web page loads, this <code>p</code> element is not shown. The JavaScript will either hide or unhide this element:</p><pre>&lt;p id="results-msg"  class="hidden" …&lt;/p&gt;</pre><p>Inside the <code>p</code> element, there are two <code>span</code> elements that contain the message for a guess that either matches or does not. They also use the <code>hidden</code> class. This is because, if their parent element is unhidden, these remain hidden until the code determines which to unhide. Each <code>span</code> element has an <code>id</code> attribute. The JavaScript will either hide or unhide each of these <code>span</code> elements:</p><pre>&lt;span id="match-msg" class="hidden"&gt;Congratulations!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="no-match-msg" class="hidden"&gt;Sorry!&lt;/span&gt;</pre><p>One more element inside the <code>p</code> element is a <code>span</code> element to show the number to guess. The JavaScript will update this:</p><pre>&lt;span id="number-to-guess"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</pre></li>
				<li>Open the <code>number-guess.js</code> document in your code editor, replace all of its content with the following code, and then save it.<p>The first line creates an object for the element with <code>idtest-button</code> using the <code>document</code> object's <code>getElementByID</code> method. </p><p>The second line adds the function named <code>testMatch</code> as the listener for the click event on the button.</p><p>The following is the <code>testMatch</code> function and a message to the console so that we can test it:</p><pre>let testButtonEle = document.getElementById('test-button');
testButtonEle.addEventListener('click', testMatch);
function testMatch(e){
 console.log("Clicked!");
}</pre></li>
				<li>Reload the <code>number-guess.html</code> web page in your web browser with the console window open and click the <code>Test Your Guess</code> button.<p>You should see the following message in the console window:</p><pre>Clicked!</pre></li>
				<li>Edit the <code>number-guess.js</code> document, update it using the bolded text, and then save it.<p>At the top of the file, all the elements we need to access in the HTML have been assigned to a variable: </p><pre>let resultsMsgEle = document.getElementById('results-msg');
let matchedMsgEle = document.getElementById('match-msg');
let noMatchMsgEle = document.getElementById('no-match-msg');
let numberToGuessEle = document.getElementById('number-to-guess');
let guessInputEle = document.getElementById('number-guessed');
let testButtonEle = document.getElementById('test-button');</pre><p>Next, add the DOM interface to get the <code>value</code> property from the input element's <code>guessInputEle</code> object. In case the user did not enter an integer, the <code>parseInt</code> JavaScript built-in function will flag that as not a number. Then, the <code>if</code> statement expression is true only if the number is between 1 and 10 inclusive:</p><pre>function testMatch(e){
 let numberGuessed = parseInt(guessInputEle.value);
 if(!isNaN(numberGuessed) &amp;&amp;numberGuessed&gt; 0 &amp;&amp;numberGuessed&lt;= 10){
 }
}</pre><p>In the <code>if</code> statement block, the first step is to get a random integer from <code>1</code> to <code>10</code>. Then, we use an <code>if...else</code> statement block if the input number matches the generated number. </p><p>For now, we can test this with outputs to the console window:</p><pre> if(!isNaN(numberGuessed) &amp;&amp;numberGuessed&gt; 0 &amp;&amp;numberGuessed&lt;= 10){
  let numberToGuess = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 + 1);
  if (numberGuessed == numberToGuess){
   console.log("MATCHED!");
  }else{
   console.log("NOT MATCHED!");
  }
  console.log("Number guessed:", numberGuessed);
  console.log("Number to match:", numberToGuess);
 }</pre></li>
				<li>Reload the <code>number-guess.html</code> web page in your web browser with the console window open, enter an integer from <code>1</code> to <code>10</code>, and click the <code>Test Your Guess</code> button a few times.<p>Here are two test results:</p><pre>NOT MATCHED!
Number guessed: 1
Number to match: 9
MATCHED!
Number guessed: 1
Number to match: 1</pre><p>Try invalid values such as letters. There should be no output to the console.</p></li>
				<li>Edit the <code>number-guess.js</code> document, update it using the bolded text, and then save it.<p>Now, we can add in the steps for updating the DOM elements with the results. To start, all the result elements are hidden when the button is clicked:</p><pre>function testMatch(e){
 matchedMsgEle.style.display = 'none';
 noMatchMsgEle.style.display = 'none';
 resultsMsgEle.style.display = 'none';
 let numberGuessed = parseInt(guessInputEle.value);</pre><p>First, the hidden container for the message elements is displayed. Then, depending on whether there is a match or not, the element showing that result is displayed. Finally, the number to guess is updated in the element that was created for it:</p><pre> if(!isNaN(numberGuessed) &amp;&amp;numberGuessed&gt; 0 &amp;&amp;numberGuessed&lt;= 10){
  resultsMsgEle.style.display = 'block';
  let numberToGuess = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 + 1);
  if (numberGuessed == numberToGuess){
   matchedMsgEle.style.display = 'inline';
  }else{
   noMatchMsgEle.style.display = 'inline';
  }
  numberToGuessEle.innerText = numberToGuess;
 }</pre></li>
				<li>Reload the <code>number-guess.html</code> web page in your web browser with the console window open and repeatedly click the <code>Test Your Guess</code> button with a value entered.<p>The result of a matching output is as follows:</p></li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 3.13: Matched value &#13;&#10;" src="img/C14377_03_13.jpg"/>

			<p>JavaScript programs may not work as intended. When that happens, it is usually called a bug. </p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-141"><a id="_idTextAnchor149"/>Silent Fail</h3>
			<p>The people viewing your web page will not see any error message unless they know about the web developer console. This is called a silent fail approach. Silent fails keep web pages free of messages that would be cryptic to visitors. However, visitors may be puzzled when they try to interact with the web page and nothing happens and there are no messages.</p>
			<p>There are two general categories of bugs: syntax and logic:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Syntax: A syntax bug is a malformed JavaScript code.</li>
				<li>Logic: A logic error occurs when code that is syntactically correct does not perform as intended.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-142"><a id="_idTextAnchor150"/>Syntax Bugs</h3>
			<p>Your console window will show you syntax errors so that they are easy to find and correct. Here is an example that shows an error at line 25 of the JavaScript file named <code>convert-celsius-fahrenheit.js</code>:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 3.16: Syntax errors in the console window&#13;&#10;" src="img/C14377_03_16.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.16: Syntax errors in the console window</p>
			<p>The error code has a description and a link to the line number in the file. When you click that link, the source code file is opened in a window and the line that's involved is brought into view, as shown here:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 3.17: Source code for the syntax error&#13;&#10;" src="img/C14377_03_17.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.17: Source code for the syntax error</p>
			<p>In this case, the error reports an <code>Unexpected token else</code>. Now, you need to look at the code to find out where the syntax is malformed. In this case, it is a missing <code>{</code> following the <code>if</code> statement on line 21. </p>
			<p>Now, you can fix the syntax error in the source file and then reload the page:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 3.18: Syntax error at load time&#13;&#10;" src="img/C14377_03_18.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.18: Syntax error at load time</p>
			<p>The syntax error appeared at load time. This means that when the JavaScript file was loaded by the web browser, the syntax error was revealed. </p>
			<p>However, a syntax error can appear at runtime. This happens while the code is executing, which does not need to happen when it's loaded, such as with a button click, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 3.19: Code executed on the web page&#13;&#10;" src="img/C14377_03_19.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.19: Code executed on the web page</p>
			<p>Here is an example of where the code is executed after the user clicks the Convert button on the web page, the user sees no error. Nothing appears to happen when the button is clicked. If the web browser console window is open, we will see the offending syntax error.</p>
			<p>The error message also includes a call stack. A call stack is a list of functions and methods that were called to reach the line that was reported in the error message. This call stack shows the <code>getFahrenheit</code> function containing the failed line. Then, it shows that the function was called inside the <code>convertButtonClickEventHandler</code> method that was assigned to an <code>HTMLButtonElement</code> object. Notice that each item in the call stack will branch you to a line in the file.</p>
			<p>We start at the link that is part of the error message, which opens the source view window and takes you to line 38. The incorrect line is followed by a comment showing the correct line. You can see that it is a simple omission of the assignment operator. The code line now has to be fixed in the source file and then reloaded. Then, the <code>Convert</code> button is clicked again to see whether the syntax error has been fixed.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-143"><a id="_idTextAnchor151"/>Logic Bugs</h2>
			<p>A logic error occurs when code that is syntactically correct does not perform as intended. Logic errors often occur due to data and expressions not using or computing the correct values. </p>
			<p>When a JavaScript program encounters a logic bug, it stops executing the remaining code statements. There is often no error message to pursue.</p>
			<p>This makes logic errors more challenging to resolve and you want to use debugging tools to aid in their resolution.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-144"><a id="_idTextAnchor152"/>Debugging</h2>
			<p>Fixing bugs is called debugging. Debugging requires tools, skills, and techniques. It usually involves correcting the source code. </p>
			<p>Using the <code>console.log</code> method and showing the values in the console window is one tool we can use. This allows you to view values at certain points in the program to see whether they are the expected values. One of the drawbacks of this approach is that this requires you to put the <code>console.log</code> method in your source code, which ultimately needs to be removed as a best practice. Another issue is that arguments to the <code>console.log</code> methods are potentially bugs themselves. </p>
			<p>The other alternative is to use a debugger. The top desktop web browsers have a JavaScript debugger.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-145"><a id="_idTextAnchor153"/>Debuggers</h2>
			<p>To help resolve logical errors, you usually need a debugger. A debugger is a tool that lets you pause a program, follow each step, and examine the data values at those steps. Most desktop web browsers have a debugger built into its web developer view. Here is an example of the debugger for the Chrome web browser's developer tools:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 3.20: Setting breaking points for the Chrome web browser&#13;&#10;" src="img/C14377_03_20.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.20: Setting breaking points for the Chrome web browser</p>
			<p>One of its most important features is setting breakpoints. A breakpoint pauses the code's execution. In this example, there is a breakpoint at line 34. It is shown not only in a <code>Breakpoints</code> panel but also in the source window, with a symbol on the line number. The symbol on the line number is actually a toggle to set or unset breakpoints. The <code>Breakpoints</code> panel is handy when you have multiple breakpoints spread out in the code and you need to enable or disable them without having to find the code line in the source window. </p>
			<p>Once the code execution hits the breakpoint, then you can inspect the expressions by hovering a mouse pointer over the code. There is also a window that keeps all the data values organized, ready for inspection. For example, the <code>guessedNumber</code> variable is shown as <code>5</code> in two places in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 3.21: Data value organized in the debugger tool&#13;&#10;" src="img/C14377_03_21.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.21: Data value organized in the debugger tool</p>
			<p>Once the execution has been paused, you can control the execution of the code using the debugger menu:</p>
			<div><div><img alt="Figure 3.22: Debugger Menu&#13;&#10;" src="img/C14377_03_22.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.22: Debugger Menu</p>
			<p>The first four choices are a good place to start:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Resume</strong>: The first choice restarts the JavaScript code's execution until it ends or reaches another breakpoint.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Step Over</strong>: The second choice will not step into a function, but into all the code in a function it calls is executed. This is useful because there may not only be many functions you have written but also third-party functions that have been written that do not require a step-by-step investigation.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Step Into</strong>: The third choice does step into a function where you can proceed. You can think of this as executing one line at a time.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Step Out</strong>: The fourth choice is a way to step out of a function to the line that called it.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>This activity will help you build a <code>todo</code> list web page. We will use JavaScript to load the list and shuffle the list after it has been loaded. A button labeled Shuffle has been added to the HTML file and the <code>ol</code> element has been assigned the ID, <code>todo-list</code>.</p>
			<p>The high-level steps for the activity are as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Use the <code>activity.js</code> file to write your code. This contains coding hint comments you may use if you desire. It also includes a function named <code>getNewShuffledArray</code>. </li>
				<li>You need to load the <code>li</code> element <code>todo</code> items from JavaScript and then allow the user to randomize the list. You may approach the activity in two parts.<p>In <code>todo</code> list items and create a function that updates the HTML DOM list items using an <code>ol</code> element and an array as parameters. The function will remove the previous <code>li</code> elements and iterate through the array to add new <code>li</code> elements with the values in the array parameter. Test before proceeding. You can find the HTML file at <a href="https://packt.live/2XcP1GU">https://packt.live/2XcP1GU</a></p></li>
				<li>In <code>todo</code> items and your previous function to update the <code>ol</code> element's list items. It also will use the <code>getNewShuffledArray</code> function to randomly shuffle an array and return the shuffled array. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>The output of this activity is as follows:</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-147"><a id="_idTextAnchor155"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>JavaScript programming is a problem-solving endeavor. It relies heavily on data and data expressions. At the start of this chapter, we mentioned that data could be people's names, temperature, image dimensions, the amount of disk storage, and total likes on a discussion group post. Data can be values for a user interface, such as screen coordinates, sizes, scroll values, colors, and fonts. </p>
			<p>A JavaScript program is a series of steps that use data. A program starts with an event. An event could be when a web browser finishes loading the web page, a mouse event, such as a click or rolling over a spot on the screen, such as a button or image, or when some data is received from a web server that was requested by JavaScript.</p>
			<p>Once the program begins, it executes the code statements sequentially and is directed by flow control statements such as <code>if</code>, <code>switch</code>, <code>for</code>, and <code>while</code>.</p>
			<p>The code is organized into units called functions. Functions contain code that may need to be repeated in more than one part of a program, but with different data and different results. Functions can take data as input values and return a result; for example, Fahrenheit as input and Celsius as output.</p>
			<p>JavaScript programs for web pages generally deal with the DOM. The DOM is just a large object that's created by the web browser. It is made up of all the data and functions</p>
			<p>Before you try to solve every coding problem, you may find that other programmers have already solved many common problems and make their code available for you to use in the form of libraries and frameworks. For example, you could use JavaScript and the DOM to write code to animate user interface elements by sliding or fading them in and out of view. However, if someone has already solved that coding problem, you may want to use their code. In the next chapter, we will look at some popular libraries and frameworks that solve a wide range of problems for a web page.</p>
