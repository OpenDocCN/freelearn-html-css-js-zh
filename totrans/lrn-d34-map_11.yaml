    a timeline, you rarely build a vertical bar chart. You would more likely use a
    horizontal line chart. You should, of course, give yourself some freedom of expression
    when encoding data to position, shape, or color. However, the data at hand, the
    meaning you want to convey, and the cognitive decoding processes at play are important
    guides when deciding how to encode your data.

    often involved. While maps are a compelling way to present data that can be deciphered
    effortlessly by most people, they can be overused. If you want to show which country
    has the highest percentage of forest cover, you might decide to show a globe and
    use color saturation to encode forest ratio. Alternatively, you could show a sorted
    vertical bar chart displaying the country with the highest forest cover on top
    and the country with the lowest at the bottom. The map version might look nicer
    and give your users a good intuition about locations of forest lack or riches.
    However, the bar chart gives a more concise overview over the distribution and
    country comparison of forest cover.

    The areas of the units are already given by the size of these units. This can
    draw the user’s attention away from the smaller, and toward, the larger units.
    Looking at our forest example, larger countries such as the US, Russia, or Brazil
    might get more initial attention than smaller countries, such as Luxembourg, Haiti,
    or Belize.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To alleviate this attention problem, you should be fair to each country in the
    measure you visualize. The key rule is to not visualize absolute numbers, but
    standardized ratios related to the country. We adhered to this rule in our forest
    example by visualizing the percentage of forested area of the total country area.
    This measure has the same range for each country, independent of the country’s
    area (0 to 100%). It’s a standardized, and hence, fair measure. The absolute number
    of trees would be an unfair measure. A large country with a few trees could still
    have more trees than a small country full of trees, rendering our comparison problematic
    to pointless.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Furthermore, the geographical unit should define the measure you visualize.
    Tax rates, for example, are made by countries and make perfect sense to compare
    across countries. Forest cover is not (entirely) informed by a country’s actions
    and policies, and makes less sense to show in a choropleth. The countries’ actions
    still influence their forest cover, so I wouldn’t disregard it (the Dominican
    Republic, for example, has a much more conservative approach to its forests than
    neighboring Haiti), but this should be a conscious part of your choice of visualization
    technique.

    Hence, they are best to represent—to **bin**—a cluster of points. Corner points
    of triangles or squares are further away from their center than corner points
    in hexagons, which make hexagons predestined for grouping dot data. Circles are

    together into equally sized categories. When we have a dataset of 100 people with
    varying ages, we can look at the frequency of each age, or we bin the data to
    more digestible age groups, such as 20-39, 40-69, and 70-99\. We take individual
    data points and aggregate them in larger and—usually—equally sized groups.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a mapping context, we can bin point location data to equally sized areas.
    Hexagons are well suited for this task as they group points well and also tessellate
    regularly across the plane. This is what a hexbin map as implemented with D3 can
    do for you. Instead of potentially piling points on top of each other as we do
    in dot density maps, we can define hexagonal areas of equal size, aggregating
    the points to a summary measure encoded with color. As such, **binning** represents
    the data for each hexagon area potentially better than individual points would
    do. The **hexagonal** **tessellation** supports the binning in that it creates
    the best possible, gap-free, and comparably fair bin shapes.

    projection. Note that equal area-conic projections require the map maker to pick
    two parallels (circles of latitude) on which the projection is based. `d3.geoAlbers`
    has been already preconfigured, picking the two parallels *[29.5,* *45.5]*. This
    produces an optimized projection for the US. When visualizing other countries

    distance by *1.5*? The D3-hexbin module will produce hexbins for us if we feed
    it **points** and a desired hexbin **radius**. The hexagon radius we set here
    should guarantee that the resulting hexagons are large enough to include at least
    one point of the grid we produce. We want a gap-free hexagon tiling after all.
    So, a tight grid should have a small radius, and a wide grid should have a wider
    radius. If we had a wide grid and a small radius, we wouldn’t get a hexagon for
    each point. There would be gaps.

  prefs: []

- en: Our grid points work as a proxy of hexagon centers. As such they are not 'perfectly'
    laid out in the sense that their vertical distance is the exact same as their
    horizontal distance with *5.25* pixels. In a perfect hexagon grid the vertical
    distance would be a little shorter than the horizontal distance as you can see
    in above figure. In order to get a relatively tight mesh of hexagons on the base
    of our proxy grid, we should chose a safe—meaning **wide—**radius to pass to the
    D3-hexbin module which indeed will deliver a perfect hexagon grid. We can calculate
    this radius with the formulae in the preceding figure as well as our distance
    (5.25 pixel) by solving for *Radius*. When re-shuffling the equation for the vertical
    distance *Distance = 1.5 * Radius* becomes *Radius = Distance / 1.5*. In our case
    the distance is *5.25 / 1.5 =* a radius of *3.5*. Using the horizontal distance
    would have given us a less safe—meaning tighter—radius with *5.25 / √3 = 3.03*,
    which in fact would produce a few gaps in our final tiling.

    the increase of values to the decrease in `t`. The curve in the **right graph**
    shows us how our adjusted `tNew` behaves after setting `t` to the *power of 10*:
    we enter the lower regions of `t` (the more purple regions) with much smaller
    input values. Put differently, we traverse the color space from yellow to purple
    in a much smaller range of domain values. Piping our example value of 24 through

    is easier. If you have many dots on a map, you might have to keep them small (1-3
    pixels) to convey a good sense of the data. Such small targets are hard to catch
    with the mouse. Furthermore, some dots will inevitably overlap, so you can’t get
    to them at all. In a hexbin map, each hexagon is reachable, if it’s not too small.
    I would even argue that our choice of hexagon size might be a little small with
    **3.5** pixels. Let’s add a drop-down control, allowing the user to change the
    size of area. Here are some hexagon size variants:'

    as we do, you might run into the **border problem**. Imagine a large hexagon just
    touching the tip of Florida. 5% of the hexagon is over land, 95% is over sea.
    However, the map readers can’t see the real coastal line. They assume the hexagon
    represents the coastal line, covering 100% land area. If that corner of Florida
    has a high point density, this hexagon should encode it. However, as it only covers
    5% of the land, and maybe around 5% of the dot density, it appears to the reader
    as though the coast of Florida is void of dots.'

- en: Another problem that becomes apparent when you look at the different sized hexagons
    above is the so-called **modifiable areal unit problem** (MAUD). The summary values
    we encode are highly dependent on the shape and the scale of our aggregation units.
    This is a problem, as the results might differ when the same analysis is applied
    to the same data. You can see the *scale effect* above; changing hexagon size
    results in a different perception of farmers markets’ density. The *shape* or
    *zone effect* can be more problematic. Using a different shape at the same scale,
    for example, 10-mile squares instead of 10-mile hexagons can change the aggregate
    and hence analysis. It then becomes an analysis of different bins rather than
    of the underlying data. This effect is particularly problematic when representing
    non-arbitrary units such as counties or census tracts, which might change in shape
    over time but remain consistent in the readers’ minds.

    hexbin map from scratch. We could have built a simple hexbin map, just covering
    areas with datapoints, but our goal was to shape a map entirely of hexagons for
    the kicks and the aesthetics. That meant a little more data preparation—creating
    a map-shaped layout grid, joining the datapoints, and eventually adding and color-encoding
    the hexagons—but doesn’t it look pretty?
