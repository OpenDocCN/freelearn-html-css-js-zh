As we move forward, the book shows you how to build a browser-browser application using WebRTC. We then focus on building a real-time web application with WebSockets.</p><p>When you've gained a solid grip on the different architectures, you'll see how to write better reactive code using functional reactive programming (FRP). Then, we'll move onto what's new in Bootstrap 4 and how it makes it easier then ever to build responsive sites. As we near the end of this book, you'll see how to build a modern single-page application that builds on the innovative component-based architecture using React and Angular 2.</p><p>After reading this book, you will have a solid knowledge of the latest JavaScript techniques, tools, and architecture required to build modern web apps.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec01"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
