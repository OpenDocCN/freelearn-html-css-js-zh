- en: Learning D3.js on your own can be a daunting task. There are literally thousands
    of examples online with differing degrees of effective, or ineffective, explanation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book uses examples that take you right from the beginning, with the basic
    concepts of D3.js, using practical examples that progressively build on each other
    both within a specific chapter and also with reference to previous chapters.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We will focus on the examples created for this book as well as those found online
    that are excellent but could use some additional explanation. Each example will
    explain how the example works either line by line or by comparison with other
    examples and concepts learned earlier in the book.
