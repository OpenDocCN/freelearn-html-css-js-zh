<h1 id="_idParaDest-130"><a id="_idTextAnchor130"/>Understanding the User Experience, Deployment Options, and DevOps</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we’re going to discuss a few other “random” topics, but that randomness really falls into two categories: the look, feel, and function of your site, and some options for deploying it to run for real. Admittedly, they are two different gears, but they mesh together in that you want any website you build to look good and work well, but obviously, that won’t be the case if you can’t build and eventually deploy it somewhere that others can access.</p>
<p>Here, you’ll learn about ways to make your website attractive while ensuring it is functional for as wide an audience as possible. These are important considerations because users are attracted to websites that look good. But, then again, looking good doesn’t much matter if the website can’t really be used by them effectively, so both are key considerations.</p>
<p>You’ll then learn about <strong class="bold">virtual machines</strong> (<strong class="bold">VMs</strong>), containers, and the cloud, all of which play into the notion of where and how to run your website because it has to run somewhere for people to access it! These options provide the flexibility and stability you need when putting a website online for all the world to see.</p>
<p>Finally, you’ll learn a bit about DevOps, which is the modern approach to managing those deployments, as well as how you build your website from source code to final form. This is important because as a website gets more complex, so does the difficulty involved in keeping everything straight and ensuring you deliver high-quality results for your clients, and DevOps can help with that.</p>
<p>This chapter, therefore, will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding what makes a website look pretty – graphic design</li>
<li>Ensuring it doesn’t just look good but also works well for everyone – <strong class="bold">user </strong><strong class="bold">experience</strong> (<strong class="bold">UX</strong>)</li>
<li>Virtualizing the world – VMs and containers</li>
<li>Keeping your head in the clouds – cloud providers</li>
<li>Taking back control – DevOps</li>
<li>Reviewing the roadmap</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-131"><a id="_idTextAnchor131"/>Technical requirements</h1>
<p>Later in this chapter, we’re going to be talking about something called VMs and something called containers. As part of that discussion, I’m going to show you some basic container functionality. To follow along, you’ll need to do two things.</p>
<p>First, go to <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org">https://www.virtualbox.org</a> and download and install<a id="_idIndexMarker422"/> Oracle VirtualBox. This is a program that lets you run VMs (whatever those are!).</p>
<p>Once that’s installed, head over to <a href="https://www.osboxes.org/ubuntu">https://www.osboxes.org/ubuntu</a> and download the 23.10 Ubuntu Linux<a id="_idIndexMarker423"/> VirtualBox image. Just keep those at the ready for later!</p>
<p>Finally, we’re going to lightly touch on Python, another programming language that developers often use. For that, you’ll need to install it on your system so that you can play with the sample code. To do so, head over to <a href="https://www.python.org">https://www.python.org</a> and download<a id="_idIndexMarker424"/> and install the version appropriate for your system.</p>
<p>You’ll also want to make sure you have the source code bundle for this book downloaded (as explained in <a href="B18315_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor082"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>) and the <code>ch05/1-python</code> directory at the ready.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-132"><a id="_idTextAnchor132"/>Understanding what makes a website look pretty – graphic design</h1>
<p>Okay, so you’ve built a website<a id="_idIndexMarker425"/> that works. That’s a fine accomplishment to be sure, but what does it <em class="italic">look</em> like? Is it attractive? Is it pleasing to the eye? Is it a work of art? Answering those questions requires delving into the realm of graphic design. But, contrary to what you might think from my using the word “art” there, it’s surprisingly scientific!</p>
<p><strong class="bold">Graphic design</strong>, in simplest terms, is the application<a id="_idIndexMarker426"/> of certain techniques and knowledge about human psychology and even physiology to create visual content that communicates messages and does so in a way that is considered visually pleasing to many people. It blends creativity and technology to convey ideas through various visual means and plays a crucial role in branding, marketing, and media production.</p>
<p>Graphic designers – as well as web developers who very often find themselves playing the role – use various tools and software to create visual compositions (in our case, web development tools), which<a id="_idIndexMarker427"/> certainly include HTML, CSS, and even <strong class="bold">JavaScript</strong> (<strong class="bold">JS</strong>). While graphic design <em class="italic">is</em> rooted in art, a good design often considers principles such as balance, contrast, and hierarchy to ensure effective communication. This is the “science” part I mentioned.</p>
<p>While graphic design, by and large, is about visual appeal – essentially, whether what’s on the screen looks pleasing – there’s also an element of usability to it. <strong class="bold">Usability</strong> refers to the ability of users<a id="_idIndexMarker428"/> to get work done efficiently with a given human-tool interface, where “tool” here can mean a website. That idea gets into something called <strong class="bold">UX</strong> – this is a topic that will be<a id="_idIndexMarker429"/> coming in the next section, but it revolves around things such as whether the user can navigate a website efficiently, whether the website meets their expectations in terms of functionality, and a lot more.</p>
<p>As an example of usability, if you have light-green text on a light-yellow background, that will likely be hard for a user to read, making the website less usable. Another example is animated backgrounds, which are all the rage on the web these days. They look great, but if you don’t properly consider the content that you’re putting on top of them, then you may make consuming that content much more difficult for users. You might disorient some users, even potentially making them feel sick. Applying graphic design principles in such scenarios can help you make the design look good while also maintaining solid usability.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the key areas that make up graphic design now.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-133"><a id="_idTextAnchor133"/>Understanding key graphic design areas</h2>
<p>Graphic design<a id="_idIndexMarker430"/> touches on several areas, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Typography</strong>: This includes things such<a id="_idIndexMarker431"/> as effective font choices, line lengths, and spacing, with the goal of making content readable and visually appealing.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Layout and print design</strong>: This is all about arranging<a id="_idIndexMarker432"/> visual elements in space effectively, ensuring that there is a pleasing use of negative space (empty areas) to highlight content better, and effective alignment of elements to make scanning content easier on the user.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Branding and logo design</strong>: Proper branding and logo design<a id="_idIndexMarker433"/> create a visual identity<a id="_idIndexMarker434"/> for companies or products. This also includes color palette choice.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Motion graphics</strong>: Not all graphics are static, especially<a id="_idIndexMarker435"/> nowadays on the web. Adding elements of animation can elevate a design greatly, but there is a fine line between elevation and distraction, and that balance must be maintained.</li>
</ul>
<p>While graphic design techniques and tools evolve constantly, along with the technology used to implement designs, the core of graphic design always remains true: the visual communication of a message or ideas, effectively and aesthetically, and for the web, it also plays a big role in making a website more usable for users, meaning less frustrating and distracting from their goals.</p>
<p>There exists a set of principles that can guide you in your graphic design duties called the Gestalt Principles, which we’ll look at now.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-134"><a id="_idTextAnchor134"/>Understanding the Gestalt Principles</h2>
<p>The <strong class="bold">Gestalt Principles</strong> are a set of psychological theories<a id="_idIndexMarker436"/> about how humans perceive visual elements. They explain why certain elements are perceived as part of a group or related in some way. These principles are often applied in graphic design to enhance understanding and organization. The principles are listed next:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Proximity</strong>: Elements that are close<a id="_idIndexMarker437"/> to each other are often perceived as related or grouped together. In graphic design for the web, related buttons or menu items are often placed close to one another to visually communicate that they are related functionally. In <em class="italic">Figure 5</em><em class="italic">.1</em>, notice how your mind groups the twelve squares on the left, the three squares in the upper right, and the three screens<a id="_idIndexMarker438"/> in the center:</li>
</ul>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 5.1: The Gestalt Proximity principle" src="img/B18315_05_1.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.1: The Gestalt Proximity principle</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Similarity</strong>: Just as with proximity, when<a id="_idIndexMarker439"/> objects look alike, we group them together in our minds. This could be in terms of shape, size, or color. In <em class="italic">Figure 5</em><em class="italic">.2</em>, your mind tends to group the dark squares together even when they aren’t immediately near each other:</li>
</ul>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 5.2: The Gestalt Similarity principle" src="img/B18315_05_2.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.2: The Gestalt Similarity principle</p>
<p class="list-inset">As another example, sizing icons or buttons on a website gives a sense of related functionality and allows the user to build a mental model that says, “Things that look like this<a id="_idIndexMarker440"/> are buttons, and I can click them,” which helps make the website more usable.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">A <strong class="bold">mental model</strong> is a common term that refers<a id="_idIndexMarker441"/> to the understanding a user creates – right or wrong – in their minds about what they’re looking at and what they’re doing as they proceed. Users build up mental models as they use an app or a website about what it’s doing, how it’s doing it, why, and what the results of actions are expected to be. It’s our job to ensure that the mental models users build match up with reality through graphic design principles.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Closure</strong>: Our minds tend to fill in missing<a id="_idIndexMarker442"/> information to create a whole image. This comes into play when we look at complex arrangements of visual elements. Our minds tend to perceive a single, recognizable pattern from them. In the example in <em class="italic">Figure 5</em><em class="italic">.3</em>, your mind perceives a pentagon even though the line is broken:</li>
</ul>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 5.3: The Gestalt Closure principle" src="img/B18315_05_3.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.3: The Gestalt Closure principle</p>
<p class="list-inset">This may be perfectly fine and even desired, but it can sometimes lead to confusion, so you have to take care in your design to avoid this where you can unless it’s what you’re going for.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Enclosure</strong>: The Enclosure principle<a id="_idIndexMarker443"/> describes the tendency of human visual perception to group elements together to form a whole, most especially when they are enclosed within a boundary of some sort, even if they are otherwise disconnected. When we see a set of elements enclosed by a solid border or even just an outline, we perceive them as a single, cohesive group, almost as a discrete shape regardless of their physical positioning. The example in <em class="italic">Figure 5</em><em class="italic">.4</em> causes your brain to subconsciously group the three squares inside the large square<a id="_idIndexMarker444"/> together even though they aren’t near each other:</li>
</ul>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 5.4: The Gestalt Enclosure principle" src="img/B18315_05_4.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.4: The Gestalt Enclosure principle</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Continuity</strong>: Our eyes follow paths, lines, or curves, often<a id="_idIndexMarker445"/> preferring to see them as continuing along an established direction rather than making abrupt changes. This principle is useful in guiding a user’s attention in a specific direction! In <em class="italic">Figure 5</em><em class="italic">.5</em>, your mind is in a sense comforted by the subconscious expectation that the boxes will get larger as you go down, as they do:</li>
</ul>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 5.5: The Gestalt Continuity principle" src="img/B18315_05_5.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.5: The Gestalt Continuity principle</p>
<p class="list-inset">For example, taking the registration page we’ve previously worked on, all the entry fields go vertically down the page, in a single line. A user’s eye can follow this easily. If one of the fields suddenly aligned to the right side of the page, that would be disruptive for users, plus it probably wouldn’t look very good visually.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Figure and Ground</strong>: We instinctively perceive objects<a id="_idIndexMarker446"/> as either being in the foreground (figure) or the background (ground). This helps designers emphasize certain elements, but you must ensure you’re emphasizing the <em class="italic">right</em> elements at the <em class="italic">right</em> time, or you can confuse users. <em class="italic">Figure 5</em><em class="italic">.6</em> shows an example of how your mind tends to view the boxes inside the large rectangle as being more “up front” than those outside, even if you don’t realize it consciously:</li>
</ul>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 5.6: The Gestalt Figure and Ground principle" src="img/B18315_05_6.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.6: The Gestalt Figure and Ground principle</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Connectedness</strong>: Elements that are connected<a id="_idIndexMarker447"/> by uniform visual properties, such as a line or color, are perceived as being more related than elements that aren’t connected. This is often implemented on the web as group boxes – those boxes around elements that often have a small title on them. In <em class="italic">Figure 5</em><em class="italic">.7</em>, the fact that the shapes in each of the two connected groups aren’t the same doesn’t stop your brain from thinking of them as connected:</li>
</ul>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 5.7: The Gestalt Connectedness principle" src="img/B18315_05_7.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.7: The Gestalt Connectedness principle</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Common Fate</strong>: Elements moving in the same<a id="_idIndexMarker448"/> direction are perceived as related or grouped. For instance, animations that move cohesively can show they’re part of the same action or concept, or even elements that move or are aligned in a haphazard way still appear to be grouped to us. <em class="italic">Figure 5</em><em class="italic">.8</em> demonstrates how your mind will see the boxes on the top being part of a continuous line and the boxes on the bottom as part of another continuous line, even though they are not spaced or aligned consistently, but because they appear to move in a consistent direction or toward a common fate:</li>
</ul>

<p>These principles help designers – and us web developers – create visual designs that are easily understood and processed by our users. By understanding how humans naturally group and separate visual information, we can create more effective, intuitive, and harmonious graphic design layouts, which for us means websites.</p>
<p>Having elements on the screen that look good and are well organized according to graphic design principles are factors in how well a user can actually use your site, but there’s more to it than that. Let’s now enter the domain of UX!</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-135"><a id="_idTextAnchor135"/>Ensuring it doesn’t just look good but also works well for everyone – UX</h1>
<p>In the previous section, we briefly <a id="_idIndexMarker449"/>discussed graphic design, and I mentioned that graphic design has a role to play in something called UX. Let’s dive into that topic in more detail now.</p>
<p>UX refers to a person’s overall experience when interacting with a product, system, or service, especially in terms of how easy or pleasing it is to use. It’s concerned with their perception of a product, with the ultimate goal being to make them happy using the thing you produce both before, during, and after using it.</p>
<p>UX is an iterative process where you research, plan, test, and then refine the various touch points a person has with a product, trying to move closer to those goals with each iteration. It’s not about guesswork; it tends to be very scientific. You can guess which features of a product will make users happy, but those guesses – which should be based on research – are just a starting point. You then need to put the product in front of people, see how they interact with it, get their feedback, and then tweak the product based on that feedback.</p>
<p>UX isn’t a web development or even a computer thing. In fact, one of the most famous books on UX ever, <em class="italic">The Design of Everyday Things</em> by Don Norman, barely even talks about computers, let alone websites – it spends more time talking about teapots and turn signals in your car! That’s because UX applies to how humans interact with any piece of technology, or really any object more generally. But, specifically within the context of digital design, UX focuses<a id="_idIndexMarker450"/> on the user’s journey through a website or application. So, let’s take a closer look at the topic.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-136"><a id="_idTextAnchor136"/>Key concepts of UX</h2>
<p>Here are some of the key concepts that comprise UX:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Usability</strong>: This is about how user-friendly <a id="_idIndexMarker451"/>and intuitive the interface is. It includes ideas such as ease of learning (are users able to discover, without reading documentation, how your app works?), efficiency of use (can users get work done with a minimum of steps?), memorability, error frequency, severity and how easily they can recover from errors, and overall user satisfaction.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Interaction design</strong>: This involves designing<a id="_idIndexMarker452"/> interactive digital products, environments, systems, and services. It’s about creating interfaces with well-thought-out behaviors. One thing you never want to do with any software product is to surprise users. It should be obvious what a button will do if they click it; they shouldn’t have to guess. Interaction design largely defines this idea.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">User research</strong>: Understanding the users’ needs, motivations, and<a id="_idIndexMarker453"/> behaviors through methods such as surveys, interviews, and usability testing (oftentimes, you’ll literally watch users interact with your website to look for things such as if they get frustrated trying to navigate it). This research informs design decisions, especially as you iterate the design.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Information architecture (IA)</strong>: This is about structuring, organizing, and<a id="_idIndexMarker454"/> labeling content<a id="_idIndexMarker455"/> effectively and sustainably. Good IA helps users find information and complete tasks. One common<a id="_idIndexMarker456"/> tool for IA is a <strong class="bold">card-sorting</strong> exercise. Let’s say you have several topics to be covered on a website, and some of them are sub-topics of others. To organize this, you might write every topic on a literal note card, then arrange the top-level topics in a line, and then put the sub-topics beneath them.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Content strategy</strong>: This involves planning, creating, delivering, and<a id="_idIndexMarker457"/> managing content. Content should be relevant and useful to users, and you should look to minimize extraneous content that might just confuse them or get in the way. In graphic design, the idea of negative space is important, which is knowing when <em class="italic">not</em> to put something on the screen. There is value in empty space sometimes, but by the same token, there can be value in <em class="italic">not</em> providing information when it won’t help a user achieve their primary goal. The company Apple is a great example of this: it tends to minimize options available to users. This can be frustrating for some more advanced users, but for typical users, it actually aids them because the phenomenon of <strong class="bold">analysis paralysis</strong> is avoided by not overloading<a id="_idIndexMarker458"/> them with options. This applies<a id="_idIndexMarker459"/> not only to options but to information as well.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">User feedback</strong>: Continuous collection of user feedback<a id="_idIndexMarker460"/> is crucial for iterative improvement of the UX. Of course, when initially designing and building a website, it’s helpful to get that feedback so that you can make changes as you go. However, seeking user feedback shouldn’t stop after the site is live. There’s always room for improvement, but you shouldn’t go about this blindly. Hearing from your users is a good way to get the information you need to make improvements based on data. User feedback can be direct – things such as surveys users can fill out – or indirect – perhaps by looking at metrics about things such as how often users click a help link, for example. If you find that every user that visits your site looks for help or, worse, abandons the site before doing something meaningful, that’s a form of feedback that is probably telling you your site isn’t as easy to use as you might have thought. Analytics and performance<a id="_idIndexMarker461"/> data are, therefore, an aspect of this.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Prototyping and wireframing</strong>: These are essential tools<a id="_idIndexMarker462"/> in UX design. Prototyping<a id="_idIndexMarker463"/> is about creating a preliminary model of a product, which can be a low-fidelity sketch or a high-fidelity interactive model. Wireframes are basic layouts that outline sizes and placement of page elements, features, and navigation for your website or app. We talked about this in the first chapter, but it’s worth mentioning it here to understand how it relates to UX. These are your early “guesses” about the overall design that you’ll want to present to users as early as possible so that you can begin iterating as needed.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">User personas</strong>: These are fictional characters<a id="_idIndexMarker464"/> created to represent the different user types that might use a service, product, site, or brand. Personas help designers and developers understand their users’ needs, experiences, behaviors, and goals. What does a persona look like? Here’s an example:<pre class="source-code">
<strong class="bold">Persona 1</strong>: Mike, a small business owner
<strong class="bold">Name</strong>: Mike Nelson
<strong class="bold">Occupation</strong>: Owner of a coffee shop
<strong class="bold">Demographics</strong>: 27 years old, lives in San Francisco. Married with two children, 3 and 6. Has a generally middle-class income level. Opened the shop 2 years ago after getting married.
<strong class="bold">Mike's Story</strong>: Mike was working at a large financial firm, but felt he didn't have enough free time for things important to him, including starting a family. So, he decided to quit his job and use his accumulated savings to open the shop. While some consider it silly, owning a coffee shop had been his dream since his college days (probably owing to how much time he spent in coffee shops during those years!)
<strong class="bold">Mike's Challenges</strong>: Mike has poor accounting skills and is having difficulty keeping the company's books. In fact, even relatively simple questions like how much net profit he has every month are difficult for him to determine. He is spending too much time on these difficulties.
<strong class="bold">What Mike Needs</strong>: Mike is looking for a product – in the form of a web-based application – that can handle the analysis of his income and expenditures and can automatically supply the information he needs. He would like to see things categorized so he knows, for example, how much he is spending on coffee grounds versus filters.</pre><p class="list-inset">With a persona such as this, design<a id="_idIndexMarker465"/> decisions can be made that will address the challenges of the client. For example, based on Mike’s challenges, we may want to create a design that presents as little information as possible at any given time to keep Mike from getting overwhelmed. Also, given his needs, we begin to have an understanding of what the interface will look like; in this case, we’ll most likely need some visual metaphor that presents categories of information, perhaps a tab for each, or maybe sections that can be expanded and collapsed for each.</p></li> <li><strong class="bold">Journey mapping</strong>: This involves creating a visual representation<a id="_idIndexMarker466"/> of the user’s interaction with a product. It helps in understanding and addressing user needs and pain points throughout their journey. As with card sorting, this will often take the form of pieces of paper on a large pegboard with string and thumbtacks. The pieces of paper may have hand-drawn sketches of various screens, and then the string shows how the user will move from one screen or function to the next. It certainly doesn’t have to take this form – some people prefer to work in a graphics or flowcharting program and do it all digitally – but the low-fidelity approach is often employed for both speed and for ensuring you aren’t focusing on anything technological. The concerns here shouldn’t take technology into account, at least no more than is absolutely <a id="_idIndexMarker467"/>necessary. You’re focusing on logic flow and nothing more.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Cross-platform consistency</strong>: Ensuring a consistent experience<a id="_idIndexMarker468"/> across various platforms and devices, which includes maintaining functionality and design uniformity. In other words, you usually want a website to look the same on a Windows machine as on a Mac machine, and you usually don’t want there to be functionality available on a desktop machine that isn’t also available on a cell phone (though the form of that function could be different, of course). There are sometimes exceptions to this idea, of course – times when it makes sense for things to look different or function differently on one platform versus another – but they tend to be just that: exceptions.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Contextual design</strong>: This is about designing based<a id="_idIndexMarker469"/> on the understanding of how users interact with the product in their actual environment. This often involves watching users use your product as they really do, not in a lab setting, because sometimes there are considerations you wouldn’t otherwise be aware of. To give one example, you could find that users of your factory control system have to use your system wearing bulky gloves. This may affect your design by requiring that buttons on the screen be much larger than usual so that they are easier to tap. You wouldn’t have known this without observing them in their natural environment (which means it’s helpful to do this as research <em class="italic">before</em> you get into designing anything too).</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Usability testing</strong>: Regular testing with real users<a id="_idIndexMarker470"/> to get feedback on designs and functionality, which is crucial for iterative design processes. You never want to assume that your designs are ideal; you want to test those assumptions as often as you can and make changes based on what you discover. There are many forms of usability testing:<ul><li>Having webcams pointed at users as they test your design.</li><li>Having a usability lab set up where things such as eye tracking (to see what a user is actually looking at and fixating on can be determined) and otherwise observing them in action come into play.</li><li>Having user interviews, where you simply sit with a user and ask them questions about their experience (sometimes done as they’re playing with your website; sometimes, afterward). Surveys and focus groups can also be considered here too.</li></ul><p class="list-inset">There are several other forms, each <a id="_idIndexMarker471"/>with a different goal and focus, but all with the one common goal of validating your design decisions against real UX.</p></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Design thinking</strong>: A problem-solving approach<a id="_idIndexMarker472"/> that involves empathizing with users, defining problems, ideating solutions, prototyping, and testing. As designers, it’s very easy to make decisions based on what you like and think is optimal, but that isn’t always what’s best for users. Research and testing play a big role in this, but there’s a larger mindset involved. You have to fight the urge to make assumptions and to make decisions based on your own thinking. It’s all about the user at the end of the day, which is where the term <em class="italic">user-centric design</em> comes in. The user is the focus; they are the center, and everything you do should be based on them.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Ethics and privacy</strong>: Considering ethical implications<a id="_idIndexMarker473"/> and privacy concerns in design, especially when dealing with user data. This can come in many forms, but one example is simply masking passwords. You’ve certainly seen websites where when you type your password, only asterisks appear. This is done so that someone can’t stand over your shoulder and see your password. It’s a small, simple example, but it shows that design plays a role<a id="_idIndexMarker474"/> in privacy.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Interaction animation</strong>: Subtle animations can improve<a id="_idIndexMarker475"/> the UX by providing feedback, demonstrating cause and effect, and adding a layer of polish and professionalism to the interaction. We talked about this in the graphic design section, but it’s worth calling out as it relates to usability because animation can be a divisive topic. Too much animation will actually annoy and frustrate users and maybe even make them sick, but too little will often yield a design that isn’t as pleasing to use as one with just the right amount used. Given all of this, that’s why the use of animation to reflect interactions is important enough to be its own key topic.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Visual design</strong>: Although distinct from<a id="_idIndexMarker476"/> UX, visual design (how things look) impacts UX. It includes typography, color schemes, and layout. Effectively, this means the same as graphic design, then, but it’s worth being aware of the term since you may hear both at various times.</li>
</ul>
<p>Incorporating these aspects of UX into your work can greatly enhance the quality and user satisfaction of the software products you develop or architect. In your role as a web developer, integrating UX principles into your development process can significantly enhance the end product’s effectiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction.</p>
<p>While in some organizations, there <a id="_idIndexMarker477"/>will be an entirely separate group responsible for UX, that won’t always be the case, and even when it is, it makes a lot of sense for you as a developer to have some grasp of these concepts, if for no other reason than to be better able to interface with such separate groups.</p>
<p>If you remember only one thing from all of this, let it be this: users are what it’s all about! You have to base your design decisions on what they need, what they want, and what makes them happy. And you need to make those decisions based on good research and testing, not assumptions.</p>
<p>Another topic that has a role to play in UX is accessibility.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-137"><a id="_idTextAnchor137"/>Considering accessibility</h2>
<p>Accessibility is, in a sense, another<a id="_idIndexMarker478"/> aspect of UX, but it’s a large enough concern to be its own topic.</p>
<p><strong class="bold">Accessibility</strong>, in the context of digital<a id="_idIndexMarker479"/> design, refers to the practice of making your websites and applications usable by as many people as possible, including those with disabilities. This encompasses a wide range of conditions, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities.</p>
<p>Here are some key points<a id="_idIndexMarker480"/> to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</strong>: These are part of a series of web accessibility<a id="_idIndexMarker481"/> guidelines published by the <strong class="bold">World Wide Web Consortium</strong> (<strong class="bold">W3C</strong>) (<a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag">https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag</a>), consisting of a set<a id="_idIndexMarker482"/> of recommendations for making web content more accessible. They encompass many points that you can follow to help make your sites accessible to various user groups with different needs.</li>
<li><code>&lt;img src="img/companyLogo.png" alt="This is a company logo showing an eagle with a fish in its beak"&gt;</code>. Someone who is blind and is using a screen reader will have the alt text read out to them, providing a description of the logo.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Keyboard navigation</strong>: Ensure that all interactive elements on a website can be accessed and used through keyboard controls, which is crucial for users who cannot use a mouse. This is generally easy to achieve and to a large extent happens automatically thanks to web browsers. The one thing you need to keep in mind, though, is relatively simple things such as the order of elements on a form. An HTML form – unless you do something wrong – should be keyboard-navigable by default. But if you don’t put the elements of the form in a logical order, what can happen is you can make elements that most users need to access more difficult to get to via the keyboard. For example, on a user registration form that needs a person’s first and last name, you probably don’t want to put the last name at the end of the form with 10 other fields between it and the first name field at the top.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Visual design</strong>: This includes considerations<a id="_idIndexMarker484"/> for color contrast to aid users with color blindness or visual impairments, as well as ensuring text size and spacing are adjustable. Some of this again comes for free with web browsers, unless you write bad code that gets in the way. But some elements of design come into play too – things such as using colors for text that work well against background colors, as a simple example.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Captioning and transcripts</strong>: Supply captions for video content and transcripts for audio content is essential for users who are deaf or hard of hearing.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Consistent navigation</strong>: Keep navigation consistent throughout the site helps users with cognitive disabilities to better understand and interact with the content. This is, of course, good for users who aren’t disabled too, though the difference is that someone with disabilities may be unable to use your site while someone without disabilities may simply not like using your site. The former is worse, but the latter isn’t much better!</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Error identification and instructions</strong>: Make sure that errors are clearly identified and instructions<a id="_idIndexMarker485"/> are provided to help users understand how to complete tasks, such as filling out forms. You never want to insult your users first of all, so simple things such as the wording of error messages are a factor. For example, writing “A first name is required” is probably better than “You didn’t enter a first name.” But more than that, you want to ensure that your error messages and instructions clearly describe what needs to be done as succinctly as possible. This is harder than it sounds and is a place where good user research is very helpful.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Legal compliance</strong>: In many regions, there are legal requirements for digital accessibility, such as the <strong class="bold">Americans with Disabilities Act</strong> (<strong class="bold">ADA</strong>) in the US. That means that what we’re talking<a id="_idIndexMarker486"/> about here isn’t just good; it’s legally <em class="italic">necessary</em> in many cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>Incorporating accessibility into your software development and design processes not only expands your user base but also reflects a commitment to inclusivity and legal compliance. As a software developer/architect, considering accessibility from the outset of a project can significantly enhance the usability and reach of your applications.</p>
<p>One final topic I want to discuss<a id="_idIndexMarker487"/> within the context of UX is something that very often plays into designing for mobile devices (though not exclusively), and that’s responsive design.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-138"><a id="_idTextAnchor138"/>Flexing with responsive design</h2>
<p>One more topic that plays<a id="_idIndexMarker488"/> into UX, but which is often considered<a id="_idIndexMarker489"/> its own, separate concept, is responsive design. Today, across the world, it’s often said that more people are accessing websites from mobile devices such as cell phones than desktop computers with large monitors sitting on their desks. Therefore, it’s often a good idea to take a mobile-first design strategy – that is, design your website to look and work well on small form factor devices such as cell phones, and <em class="italic">then</em> enhance it to work better on larger screens. This is where responsive design comes into play.</p>
<p><strong class="bold">Responsive design</strong> is an approach to website design that has the goal of creating sites that provide an optimal viewing experience, meaning it is easy to read and navigate with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling, across a wide range of devices, from large desktop computer monitors to smaller mobile phones. While there are some specific technological components, it’s largely more about a basic approach, a mindset even. It’s based on the knowledge that a large percentage of the world’s population uses smaller mobile devices to access the internet these days rather than desktop computers with, typically, large monitors.</p>
<p>Key aspects of responsive design<a id="_idIndexMarker490"/> include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Fluid grids</strong>: The layout of a website can use<a id="_idIndexMarker491"/> a CSS construct called flexible grids. They adapt to the viewer’s screen size automatically, reflowing content or even rearranging it as needed. This also means that instead of designing fixed-width layouts, elements on the page are sized in relative units such as percentages, rather than absolute units such as pixels.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Flexible images</strong>: Images in responsive design are also fluid. They are sized in relative units to prevent them from displaying outside their containing element. This ensures that images don’t suddenly take up a large chunk of the screen real estate, pushing more important content out of the way.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Media queries</strong>: CSS media queries allow the page to use different CSS style rules based on the characteristics of the device, most commonly the width of the browser. I’ll give an example of this shortly.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Mobile first</strong>: The concept here is that you should design for small screens first and then add more features and content for larger screens as necessary. It ensures accessibility for mobile users from the start.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Breakpoints</strong>: In responsive design, breakpoints are used to define where the website’s layout should change to accommodate different screen sizes. Common breakpoints are set for mobile, tablet, and desktop widths. Breakpoints and media queries typically work together in that breakpoints typically are implemented, in part, using media queries.</li>
<li><code>em</code> or <code>rem</code> for text sizing, which are alternate units available in CSS (as opposed to <code>px</code> and <code>pt</code>, for example – there are <em class="italic">a lot</em> of units available in CSS for more advanced use cases).</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Touch versus mouse</strong>: Developers should<a id="_idIndexMarker492"/> be aware that some users will be using devices where touch is the primary method of interaction – a smartphone, for example – versus desktops that are more often used with mice. Touch interactions have different needs than those with a mouse. As one common example, buttons tend to need to be larger for touch interactions.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Performance optimization</strong>: Responsive sites often need to load on various devices with different capabilities and connection speeds. While many users will have modern, high-powered smartphones, that isn’t always the case. Some may have underpowered devices that are simply slower. Therefore, optimizing images, minifying CSS and JS (reducing their size through various tools), and leveraging techniques such as lazy loading, where images and other content aren’t even loaded until the user scrolls far enough down the page for them to be visible, can help improve performance for all users, but especially those using weaker devices.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Testing</strong>: Responsive designs must be tested on multiple devices and browsers to ensure compatibility and usability. This can involve physical device testing, emulators, and online sites<a id="_idIndexMarker493"/> that can simulate a website across many different devices and configurations at once.</li>
</ul>
<p>Responsive design is essential in a web environment where users expect a seamless experience whether they’re on a phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop. For a web developer, understanding the principles of responsive design is crucial for creating web applications that are accessible and user-friendly across all devices.</p>
<h3>Demonstrating responsive design</h3>
<p>To demonstrate responsive<a id="_idIndexMarker494"/> design at a very simple level, take a look at this HTML page:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Simple Responsive Design Example&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;style&gt;
      .container {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
        gap: 10px;
      }
      @media (max-width: 600px) {
        .container { grid-template-columns: 1fr; }
      }
    &lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class="container"&gt;
      &lt;div style="background-color:#b0b0b0;"&gt;Column 1&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div style="background-color:#b0b0b0;"&gt;Column 2&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div style="background-color:#b0b0b0;"&gt;Column 3&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre> <p>To break it down, let’s look at the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> content first. As you can see, it’s three <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements inside a single <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element. The outer <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element is assigned the <code>container</code> style class, while all three of the inner <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements have an inline style to give them a gray background color.</p>
<p>What we’re doing here is building<a id="_idIndexMarker495"/> a page that has three boxes of content. Maybe the first is a navigation menu, the second is the main content, and the third is probably for some ads (because it seems that every website in the world has to have ads today, unfortunately!). This is a pretty typical layout for a website.</p>
<p>Now, on a large screen, we want to show this content in three columns, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5</em><em class="italic">.9</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 5.9: Our web page in three columns" src="img/B18315_05_9.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.9: Our web page in three columns</p>
<p>However, on a smaller device (specifically on a screen less than 600 pixels in width), we want this content to wrap so that all three boxes “stack” on top of one another, as you see in <em class="italic">Figure 5</em><em class="italic">.10</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 5.10: Our web page, now “stacked” so that the boxes are effectively rows now" src="img/B18315_05_10.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.10: Our web page, now “stacked” so that the boxes are effectively rows now</p>
<p>This will also happen as you resize<a id="_idIndexMarker496"/> the browser window on a large screen. As you make the window smaller, the content should automatically reflow as described and shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5</em><em class="italic">.10</em>, and I encourage you to actually do that now to see what happens.</p>
<p>It’s the CSS that is responsible for this rearranging of the content, so let’s check that out now.</p>
<p>First, we have the <code>container</code> class definition, which<a id="_idIndexMarker497"/> is applied to our <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element. This uses a CSS feature called <code>display</code> to <code>grid</code> tells the browser that the contents inside this <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element should be laid out in a grid, meaning we’ll have some number of rows and columns inside it. Setting <code>grid-template-columns</code> specifies that we want columns, and the <code>repeat(3, 1fr)</code> value specifies that we want three columns of equal size. The <code>repeat()</code> statement allows us to specify styles across multiple elements, and the <code>fr</code> unit is a flexible unit that allows us to define what fraction of the total available space each column gets. So, <code>1fr</code> means each column, of which there will be three, should get one equal fraction of the total, so the browser will distribute the space evenly between them. Finally, the <code>gap</code> property simply tells the browser how much space, if any, to put between the columns. Altogether, this defines the grid layout we want our three boxes to use by default.</p>
<p>That’s the first part of the responsive equation. The second part<a id="_idIndexMarker498"/> is the <code>@media</code> statement, which is a <code>max-width</code> part. So, in other words, the style inside this media query will only be applied when the width of the browser window is less than <code>600</code> pixels. This means<a id="_idIndexMarker499"/> we’re defining a <code>600</code> pixels: we want the layout of the page – the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> container, more specifically – to change when we hit <code>600</code> pixels wide.</p>
<p>Below 600 pixels, the style applied to the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> container overrides the <code>grid-template-columns</code> value defined in the <code>container</code> class itself, setting it to <code>1fr</code>. Since <code>repeat()</code> is not used this time, we’ll wind up with just a single column, and <code>1fr</code> now means one fraction of the total space should be allotted to it, but since there’s just one column, all the space is used up by it, which causes the boxes inside to wrap underneath each other.</p>
<p>You can define as many breakpoints<a id="_idIndexMarker500"/> as you like, and you can use media queries to apply styles based on other conditions, but when it comes to responsive design, it’s nearly always going to be widths such as this.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-139"><a id="_idTextAnchor139"/>Progressing with progressive enhancement</h2>
<p>Another factor that plays<a id="_idIndexMarker501"/> into whether a website is accessible or not can depend on things beyond your control, such as the capabilities of the browser and even a user’s connectivity. We’ve discussed that many users use smaller devices such as phones to access sites these days, which will sometimes mean less powerful browsers. And even when the browsers are full-featured, imagine the scenario where a user is trying to access a site while riding on a train. In such a case, their connection speed may be considerably slower than at home and may not be stable either.</p>
<p>These sorts of concerns are where an approach<a id="_idIndexMarker502"/> to web development called <strong class="bold">progressive enhancement</strong> comes into play. This is the theory that you should start from a bare-bones design and then enhance it when accessed based on factors such as connection speed and browser capabilities.</p>
<p>A simple example might begin with this simple markup:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Progressive Example&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;form action="/handleForm" method="post" id="myForm"&gt;
      Email: &lt;input type="text" id="email" name="email"&gt;
      &lt;button type="submit"&gt;Subscribe&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;div id="myDiv" style="color:red;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre> <p>That’s a complete, functional – albeit extremely<a id="_idIndexMarker503"/> simple – website, perhaps<a id="_idIndexMarker504"/> to allow a user to subscribe to your newsletter. It will work fine in virtually any browser on any device. However, what if we want to ensure the email address is in a valid form? That’s easy to do with JS, but what if the browser doesn’t support JS at all or the user disables it? What we need is a way to ensure that the page will work even without JS but will work <em class="italic">better</em> when JS <em class="italic">is</em> available. This is where progressive enhancement comes into play (this is the <code>progressive.html</code> file in the <code>ch-5</code> directory):</p>
<pre class="source-code">
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Progressive Example&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;form action="/handleForm" method="post" id="myForm"&gt;
      Email: &lt;input type="text" id="email" name="email"&gt;
      &lt;button type="submit"&gt;Subscribe&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;div id="myDiv" style="color:red;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    document.getElementById("myForm").addEventListener("submit", function(event) {
      const email = document.getElementById("email").value;
      if (!email.includes("@")) {
        document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML = "Email must contain @";
        event.preventDefault();
      }
    });
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre> <p>Now, what happens <a id="_idIndexMarker505"/>is that when the page<a id="_idIndexMarker506"/> fully loads, the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> block executes. In it, we get a reference to the form using <code>document.getElementById()</code>, and then call <code>addEventListener()</code> on the DOM node returned. This adds an event listener function for the form’s <code>submit</code> event, which fires when the user clicks the <code>email</code> field. It then checks to see if it includes an <code>@</code> sign. While this is definitely not a complete test of email address validity, it’s good enough for this simple example. If no <code>@</code> sign is present, then an error message is shown in the <code>myDiv</code> <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element. Finally, the call to <code>event.preventDefault()</code> stops the form submission from occurring (the <code>event</code> object passed into the function contains all information about the event the function is called in response to – the form submission, in this case – and provides some functions to work with it, including the <code>preventDefault()</code> function to terminate whatever the default action would be, which in this case is sending the form to the server).</p>
<p>This is a good thing to do because when you can catch simple errors such as this in the browser without having to involve the server, that’s a more efficient approach. But, since browsers will ignore what they don’t understand, which would include the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> block if JS isn’t available, there’s no harm in it being present. If JS isn’t available, then you still have a functional form (and one presumes the email address will be checked for validity on the server). But when JS <em class="italic">is</em> available, the page is enhanced to do the email address validation in the browser. That’s the basic idea of progressive enhancement.</p>
<p>Responsive design is effectively a form of progressive enhancement in that the display can change based on the size of the screen, providing functionality for all users. Both responsive design and progressive enhancement play into accessibility because the very idea of accessibility is to make a site accessible. If the form submission <em class="italic">depended</em> on the JS working, then the page would be broken when JS isn’t available, and hence it wouldn’t be accessible to those users. By progressively<a id="_idIndexMarker507"/> enhancing, we ensure everything works in roughly the same way<a id="_idIndexMarker508"/> regardless.</p>
<p>The idea of progressive enhancement also starts down the path to something else called <strong class="bold">Progressive Web Apps</strong> (<strong class="bold">PWAs</strong>), which is what we’ll talk about now.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-140"><a id="_idTextAnchor140"/>PWAs</h2>
<p>All the ideas discussed<a id="_idIndexMarker509"/> so far lead to one<a id="_idIndexMarker510"/> final frontend topic: <strong class="bold">PWAs</strong>.</p>
<p>PWAs are a way to write more advanced websites – web applications, really – by using common web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JS (which may or may not use various libraries, which you’ll explore in the next chapter). They are intended to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant web browser. PWAs<a id="_idIndexMarker511"/> have several defining features and benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Responsive</strong>: PWAs should fit any form factor, be it desktop, mobile, tablet, or device that hasn’t even been developed yet or is in the early days (virtual reality, anyone?)</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Progressive enhancement</strong>: The core functionality of the app should work for every user no matter what their browser and OS capabilities are, but then progressive enhancement is used to provide a better experience for users with more capable platforms.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Connectivity independent</strong>: Using a special bit of JS code called a <strong class="bold">service worker</strong>, PWAs can work even when the user<a id="_idIndexMarker512"/> is offline. This is accomplished by storing resources (HTML, CSS, JS, images, and more) on the client<a id="_idIndexMarker513"/> and using those stored – known as <strong class="bold">cached</strong> – versions when the user can’t connect to the network.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">An app-like feel</strong>: PWAs often feel more like desktop apps (native apps, we call them) rather than websites. This comes about due to things such as alerts appearing like others generated by the OS, the ability to use hardware devices that generally aren’t usable on a website, and more complex interactions (multiple windows, for example).</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Fresh</strong>: While service workers allow for offline access, they also provide a mechanism by which to update those cached resources when online. This ensures the PWA has the latest code and therefore appears <em class="italic">fresh</em> to the user.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Safe</strong>: PWAs can only be served via HTTPS connections. This prevents snooping and ensures content hasn’t been tampered with.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Discoverable</strong>: Thanks to some special configuration files you must provide when building a PWA, they are identified as an application, not merely a website, to the browser and the OS. This is what allows them to be installed.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Installable</strong>: Users can add apps to their home <a id="_idIndexMarker514"/>screen on their<a id="_idIndexMarker515"/> phone, or their desktop/start menu<a id="_idIndexMarker516"/> on a PC or Mac, without the hassle of going through an app store. Simply going to a URL like any other website, as long as the website provides a few necessary pieces (service worker and a configuration file called a manifest file, mainly), is enough for the browser and OS to treat it as an installable app, much like any other app you might install.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Linkable</strong>: Since a PWA is fundamentally still a website – just one with more capabilities – it means it is easily shared via a URL and does not require complex installation. Typically, visiting a website that is set up to be a PWA will trigger a request asking if you want to install it. After that, it appears like any other installed app on your phone or computer.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a software developer, building a PWA involves creating a responsive web application that includes a manifest file and a service worker – the manifest file provides information about the application (such as name, author, icon, and description) to the browser, and the service worker enables features such as push notifications, background data sync, and offline functionality via caching and updating of resources. PWAs bridge the gap between web applications and native applications, offering the UX and capabilities of native apps with the reach and accessibility of the web.</p>
<p>Building a PWA isn’t fundamentally complex, but it does involve a few steps that can be tricky, especially when dealing with the need to work over HTTPS only. Because of this, I’m not going to demonstrate building one here as it’s definitely a more advanced topic. While PWAs are fairly popular these days, they aren’t universally supported, nor are they something you definitely need to know. In fact, you may never need to build one at all. If you do, though, this section should have laid the groundwork for understanding the basics, and you can explore it at a later time, when and if you need to.</p>
<p>So, yes – ensuring your website looks good and follows good UX practices so that it is functional for your users is very important. Implementing responsive design is often a part of that, and using progressive concepts can also result in a more efficient experience for your users. PWAs are another potential level after that.</p>
<p>But none of that would much matter<a id="_idIndexMarker517"/> if you don’t put your website<a id="_idIndexMarker518"/> somewhere that can be accessed by those users. While that can be as easy as dropping your code onto a physical server, in this day and age, that’s not necessarily the best answer. Plus, best or not, it’s for sure not the <em class="italic">only</em> answer. Along these lines, another concept that plays into deploying a website is virtualization, by way of VMs and containers, and that’s the next topic up for discussion!</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-141"><a id="_idTextAnchor141"/>Virtualizing the world – VMs and containers</h1>
<p>In the last chapter, you played <a id="_idIndexMarker519"/>around with Linux<a id="_idIndexMarker520"/> a bit via some online Linux playgrounds (you <em class="italic">did</em> do that, right?). Did you stop for a second and wonder how those sites pulled that off? You were essentially logging in to a machine running Linux, but surely there couldn’t be a physical server for every user who might be doing the same thing at the same time, could there? In all likelihood, the answer is no. Instead, they most probably used either a VM or a container to pull off that magic.</p>
<p><strong class="bold">VMs and containers</strong> are two different but related technologies used to create efficient, isolated environments for running applications. They both have the same basic goal, which is to virtualize an environment.</p>
<p>But what does <em class="italic">virtualize</em> mean? To explain that, you have to think about how a computer normally works.</p>
<p>Normally, you have some hardware – obviously, things such as motherboards, CPUs, memory, various buses for components to communicate over, and so on. This is all physical stuff – electronics and all that.</p>
<p>Then, on top of the hardware, you have an operating system or OS. It might be Windows, or maybe Linux, or perhaps macOS, and so on. Sharp-eyed readers may realize<a id="_idIndexMarker521"/> there is also something called <em class="italic">firmware</em>, which is software that is permanently embedded in the hardware. You can kind of think of that as part of the hardware, though, since that’s where it lives. For the most part, it’s the hardware plus the software in the form of an OS, and of course, then all the applications that run on top of that, which is more software.</p>
<p>So now, <strong class="bold">virtualizing</strong> in essence means to take all of that – the hardware, software/firmware, all of it – and simulate it in a computer. Through some very clever coding, it is possible to simulate a computer, all the way down to the hardware, in software. How that works is <em class="italic">way</em> beyond the scope of this book, but fortunately, it doesn’t really matter either! We can simply be happy that such magic exists.</p>
<p>The benefit to this, probably the biggest one anyway, is this virtualized computer – which is completely separate from<a id="_idIndexMarker522"/> the computer it’s running on (typically called the <em class="italic">host</em>). If you create a file on the host, usually, it won’t be accessible from a virtualized computer running on it and vice versa. If you install some piece of software on a virtualized computer, it has no impact on the host. It’s literally as if you have two different computers; they are isolated from one another.</p>
<p>There is more than one way<a id="_idIndexMarker523"/> to virtualize a computer<a id="_idIndexMarker524"/> such as this, and two of the most common are VMs and containers. These strive to achieve the same basic goal – simulating a computer inside of another – but they differ significantly in their approach and architecture. Let’s talk about both now, see how they compare and how they differ, and why we might choose one over another.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-142"><a id="_idTextAnchor142"/>Understanding VMs</h2>
<p>A VM is really what I was<a id="_idIndexMarker525"/> just describing. Architecturally, a VM includes not only the application and necessary binaries and libraries to supply the functionality a user might want but also an entire OS, which we typically call the <em class="italic">guest</em>.</p>
<p>A VM runs on a physical<a id="_idIndexMarker526"/> server and is managed by a <strong class="bold">hypervisor</strong>, such as VMware’s ESXi, Microsoft’s Hyper-V, or Oracle’s VirtualBox. The hypervisor is simply a program that manages VMs, managing things such as their access to the underlying physical hardware. Since it’s possible to run multiple VMs on one physical machine, and since those machines will at some level need to use and share the real physical hardware, the hypervisor manages that sharing and ensures there are no conflicts.</p>
<p>VMs are ideal for running applications<a id="_idIndexMarker527"/> that require a full OS, for ensuring complete isolation, or when running applications on different OS types. For example, if you usually use a Windows machine but want to play with Linux, you can create a VM using your favorite version of Linux, which will then appear as a separate window, as you can see in <em class="italic">Figure 5</em><em class="italic">.11</em>. You can then install software in Linux, completely separate from your Windows host:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.11: Ubuntu Linux running in a VirtualBox VM on top of Windows 11</p>
<p>VMs are very compatible and as such can run almost any OS you like. In fact, you can even run older OSs that wouldn’t work on your physical machine anymore, which provides a solution for running legacy applications, or applications requiring specific OS environments that you wouldn’t normally want to run on your computer.</p>
<p>Each VM has its own set of virtual hardware (CPUs, memory, disks, and so on), including storage devices, which are in effect carved out from your physical storage. This leads to potentially higher storage requirements on your host. For example, if you have a 500 GB hard drive in your computer and you want to create a Linux VM with a 100 GB hard drive, this means you lose 100 GB of your physical hard drive to the VM.</p>
<p>VMs require more management overhead due to the need to support separate OSs and virtual hardware configurations. Remember – you in effect have more than one computer to deal with now! When you first create a VM, it is “naked,” meaning that it’s just like having a physical computer with nothing on it yet. You will then have to install the OS yourself (which means you’ll need a proper license for it). Later, when updates need to be done, you’ll need to do that yourself, on top of any you might have to do on your host machine. It’s just more management you need to do, just like having two physical machines.</p>
<p>VMs nowadays provide excellent performance, which is a bit surprising given they are simulating a full computer, often down to the hardware level. There are a lot of tricks played to make this happen, things such as effective sharing of the physical hardware. But however it’s done, on a sufficiently powerful host machine, you should notice only small performance differences in the guest. In fact, if you maximize the window a VM is running in, you should<a id="_idIndexMarker528"/> find that it’s fairly tough to tell it isn’t the physical machine at that point.</p>
<p>Let’s now set up a Ubuntu Linux VM inside VirtualBox to play around with.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-143"><a id="_idTextAnchor143"/>Using VMs</h2>
<p>As per the <em class="italic">Technical requirements</em> section<a id="_idIndexMarker529"/> of the chapter, you should already have VirtualBox installed, and you should have downloaded a copy of Ubuntu Linux. Now, to set up a VM in VirtualBox, click the <strong class="bold">Machine</strong> menu, then the <strong class="bold">New</strong> button. You should get a dialog like what is shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5</em><em class="italic">.12</em>, where you can enter a name, select a folder to store all the VM files in, and select the right type and version (<strong class="bold">Linux</strong> and <strong class="bold">Ubuntu</strong> respectively, most likely the 64-bit version of Ubuntu specifically):</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 5.12: Setting up Ubuntu in VirtualBox" src="img/B18315_05_12.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.12: Setting up Ubuntu in VirtualBox</p>
<p>You’ll then need to tell VirtualBox<a id="_idIndexMarker530"/> to use the VDI file you downloaded. <strong class="bold">VDI</strong> stands for <strong class="bold">Virtual Disk Image</strong>, and it is a file that stores<a id="_idIndexMarker531"/> the contents of a storage device, like a hard drive, right down to the byte level, so it’s an exact byte-for-byte copy of that device. To do that, click on the <strong class="bold">Hard Disk</strong> section at the bottom, select <strong class="bold">Use an Existing Virtual Hard Disk File</strong>, then click the icon next to the dropdown that says <strong class="bold">Empty</strong> in it. You’ll then see the dialog shown in <em class="italic">Figure 5</em><em class="italic">.13</em>. Click <strong class="bold">Add</strong> and add the VDI file you downloaded earlier. Make sure it’s highlighted, then click <strong class="bold">Choose</strong>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 5.13: Adding the VDI to VirtualBox" src="img/B18315_05_13.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.13: Adding the VDI to VirtualBox</p>
<p>That dialog will close, and you’ll be back on the one from <em class="italic">Figure 5</em><em class="italic">.12</em>. All the default values there should be fine, so you can simply click <strong class="bold">Finish</strong>. You now have a Ubuntu VM!</p>
<p>All you need to do now<a id="_idIndexMarker532"/> is click the <code>osboxes.org</code>). As you play around, realize that it’s just like you’re connected to a different computer in that window, which of course is the whole point of a VM. You can run various applications and install new ones – anything you can do on a real computer can be done in this VM.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, though, VMs are just one way to skin the virtualization cat. Another extremely popular way is containers, so let’s look at them now.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-144"><a id="_idTextAnchor144"/>Understanding containers</h2>
<p>Containers differ from VMs<a id="_idIndexMarker533"/> in that they are not simulations of whole computers, though you can be fooled into thinking they are. In many cases, you can log in to a container and do everything inside of it that you could in a VM or a physical machine. They pull this off by isolating what’s inside the container and what’s outside on the host at a low level in the host OS.</p>
<p><strong class="bold">Containers</strong> are primarily a Linux facility as they depend on certain low-level capabilities in the Linux kernel (the core code that the entire Linux OS is built on top of). You can run containers on Windows too, but the way it’s done there is actually by using a Linux VM in a way transparent to you!</p>
<p>But, regardless, the basic architecture of a container is that containers package together an application and its dependencies (things such as libraries, binaries, and so on) but share the OS kernel of the host system. Whereas the kernel is simulated inside a VM, a container uses the actual kernel that the host OS is in.</p>
<p>Just as with VMs, containers<a id="_idIndexMarker534"/> are isolated from the host OS, despite the fact that they share the kernel and other system resources. The OS itself takes care of that isolation automatically, so from our user perspective, it looks like a VM, which of course looks like a physical machine.</p>
<p>Containers have a couple<a id="_idIndexMarker535"/> of benefits over VMs:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, because they aren’t simulating a full machine, they are noticeably faster. This is especially apparent during startup. Whereas a VM has to go through a full OS boot cycle just like a real computer, a container does not, and so they tend to start pretty much instantly. They also use considerably fewer host resources since, again, they aren’t simulating a whole computer.</li>
<li>Second, containers provide a more consistent environment. Think about earlier chapters where we talked about being able to give a developer a <code>package.json</code> file, which they can then run <code>npm install</code> with and get all the dependencies your application needs. That is indeed handy, but what happens if they have a different version of Node installed than you do? And what if that version happens to have a bug that yours doesn’t? That developer may find that your project doesn’t work on their machine but does on yours. Containers solve this by bundling up not only your code and its dependencies but even things such as Node. If you give that developer a container instead, you can ensure their environment matches yours, so you know your code will work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Containers are a general term for what is a function of the operating system. But you won’t usually be interacting with this function directly because it is, to put it mildly, not a pleasant experience. Instead, you’ll almost certainly use some sort of software that is a wrapper around that function. The most popular<a id="_idIndexMarker536"/> such wrapper today by far is called Docker. In fact, it’s so popular that people will usually call them <em class="italic">Docker containers</em> rather than just containers. Let’s talk about containers under Docker a bit now and see them in action!</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-145"><a id="_idTextAnchor145"/>Using containers</h2>
<p>To play with containers, we’re actually<a id="_idIndexMarker537"/> going to use your brand-new Ubuntu VM! You see, since containers require Linux, and since I don’t know what OS you’re using normally, I can at least be sure you have Ubuntu running in VirtualBox at this point, so I know you have a Linux machine available, albeit a virtual one!</p>
<p>The first thing you’ll need to do, inside your VM, is launch the Terminal application. This gets you to a command prompt. Next, you’ll need to install Docker with this command:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
sudo apt install docker.io</pre> <p>Confirm the installation when prompted, and then give it a minute or two, depending on your internet connection speed. Once it’s done, execute this command:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
sudo docker</pre> <p>You should be prompted with the help documentation. Now, you are ready to start a container!</p>
<p>As is customary when talking about seemingly anything in programming, we’ll start by spinning up a “Hello, World!” container. As luck would have it, Docker Hub, which is a website that is a public image repository run by the company behind Docker, has just such an image available! We can pull the image down to our local machine and use it to create a container, all with one simple command:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
sudo docker run hello-world</pre> <p>Go ahead and execute that, and after a couple of seconds, you should see something like <em class="italic">Figure 5</em><em class="italic">.14</em> greet you:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 5.14: Your very first Docker container!" src="img/B18315_05_14.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.14: Your very first Docker container!</p>
<p>What actually happens is that, first, Docker will look for an image named <code>hello-world</code> on your system. When you create<a id="_idIndexMarker538"/> a container, you always start from a blueprint known as an image. The image almost always begins with an operating system and then has stuff added on top of it, building up to the final image. You can think of an image as a snapshot of an OS filesystem at a given point in time, but it’s not a snapshot of your host OS; it’s a snapshot of the result of a series of steps used to build up the image layer by layer as if you were executing the commands yourself. Docker then takes that image and creates a container from it. You can have multiple containers running based on a single image if you wish, just like you can have multiple houses built from the same blueprint.</p>
<p>If the specified image isn’t present on your system yet, Docker will call out to Docker Hub and look for an image with the name you requested and download it if found (or give you an error if it’s not). From that point on, new containers can be spawned from that image without requesting<a id="_idIndexMarker539"/> anything from Docker Hub again.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve created your first container, let’s take a very brief look at some of the most common commands you might need to work with containers.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-146"><a id="_idTextAnchor146"/>Learning basic Docker commands</h2>
<p>The <code>docker</code> program<a id="_idIndexMarker540"/> is your interface into Docker itself, and it provides many different commands to control Docker. Let’s take a look at some.</p>
<h3>Listing images</h3>
<p>How can you tell what <a id="_idIndexMarker541"/>images and containers there are available<a id="_idIndexMarker542"/> on your system? Well,  that’s easy:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
sudo docker images</pre> <p>That will list all the images previously downloaded onto your system from which you can create containers.</p>
<h3>Listing containers</h3>
<p>For listing<a id="_idIndexMarker543"/> containers, it’s just<a id="_idIndexMarker544"/> as easy:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
sudo docker ps</pre> <p>Modeled on the Linux <code>ps</code> command, this command shows your containers, but it only shows you running containers. After the <code>hello-world</code> container finishes its work, it shuts down immediately. Therefore, you won’t see it running with this command. Other containers will continue running and so will show up with this command; it all depends on what the container is meant to do.</p>
<p>However, the container still exists in a sense, and you can see it by adding an option to the previous command:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
sudo docker ps -a</pre> <h3>Starting (and stopping) containers</h3>
<p>You could start a container<a id="_idIndexMarker545"/> again if you want<a id="_idIndexMarker546"/> by running the following command:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
sudo docker start &lt;container_id_or_name&gt;</pre> <p>For this <code>hello-world</code> container, however, nothing will happen when you do this, and the container will exit at once. It only seems to show that helpful information when initially run.</p>
<p>You can also stop a running container with this command:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
sudo docker stop &lt;container_id_or_name&gt;</pre> <p>As a quick aside, at this point, you may realize that entering the container IDs that Docker generates can get annoying in a hurry (and, plus, you’ve seen me write <code>&lt;container_id_or_name&gt;</code>, implying you can do something other than using the default ID). Fortunately, Docker also generates a name for each container, as you can see in the <code>ps</code> output (and it can often be quite entertaining to see what it spits out!). However, it’s more user-friendly to give it a name yourself, which you can do with the following option:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
docker run --name MyAwesomeContainer hello-world</pre> <p>Now, you should see a container with the specified name, which you can then use to interact with it.</p>
<p>You should also be aware<a id="_idIndexMarker547"/> that when using the ID, you can enter<a id="_idIndexMarker548"/> a partial ID, starting from the beginning and entering enough to be unique. The first few characters are usually sufficient. In my opinion, though, providing a name is the overall better and easier approach as you have less chance of accidentally doing something to the wrong container (in theory, at least!).</p>
<h3>Removing containers and images</h3>
<p>You’ll probably want<a id="_idIndexMarker549"/> to clean<a id="_idIndexMarker550"/> up those containers<a id="_idIndexMarker551"/> at some point, and there’s a<a id="_idIndexMarker552"/> command for that:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
sudo docker rm &lt;container_id_or_name&gt;</pre> <p>If the container is running, Docker won’t let you remove it until you stop it. Likewise, you can remove images like so:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
sudo docker rmi &lt;image_id_or_name&gt;</pre> <p>As with containers, Docker won’t allow you to remove an image that’s used by a container, regardless of whether it’s running or not, so you’ll need to clean up the containers first.</p>
<h3>Searching for images</h3>
<p>While I think it’s much easier<a id="_idIndexMarker553"/> to go to Docker Hub<a id="_idIndexMarker554"/> through the web<a id="_idIndexMarker555"/> to look for images, which you can do at <a href="https://hub.docker.com">https://hub.docker.com</a>, you also can search for an image directly from the command line:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
sudo docker search hello-world</pre> <p>This returns a list of many images that include the <code>hello-world</code> string in their name.</p>
<h3>Attaching to a container</h3>
<p>Sometimes, you’ll want to treat<a id="_idIndexMarker556"/> containers like VMs<a id="_idIndexMarker557"/> and log in to them, assuming it’s one that keeps running. To show that, we’ll need a container that will continue running, so let’s use <code>nginx</code> for that:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
sudo docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name my_nginx nginx</pre> <p>The <code>-d</code> option “detaches” the terminal session from the container, which causes it to run in the background (assuming whatever is inside the container doesn’t exit immediately). You’ll be returned to your command prompt, but the container will continue to run. The <code>-p</code> option is for exposing network ports. Here, we’re saying that port <code>8080</code> inside the container should be exposed as port <code>80</code> on the host machine’s network interface.</p>
<p>Once you execute this command, do <code>sudo docker ps</code>, and you should see a running container for the first time.</p>
<p>Now, with a container running, we can go ahead and attach to it:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
sudo docker exec -it my_nginx /bin/bash</pre> <p>Here, you can see a few things. First, the <code>-i</code> option keeps the system’s <code>STDIN</code> input stream open so that it can be interacted with. The <code>-t</code> option allocates a new pseudo-tty terminal session (for all intents and purposes, this means a Linux command prompt). <code>/bin/bash</code> at the end is a command that is executed after the container is started, in this case specifying a Linux <code>bash</code> command prompt. All three combined result in you being “inside” the container.</p>
<p>The command prompt you see at that point is the command prompt inside the container itself. Go ahead and do some <code>bash</code>-y stuff (for example, <code>ls</code>), and you should notice that what you see differs from your host operating system (though if you’re using Ubuntu, then it’s going to look very similar anyway). Execute the <code>exit</code> command, and you’ll be dropped back<a id="_idIndexMarker558"/> to your actual host VM’s command<a id="_idIndexMarker559"/> prompt.</p>
<h3>Viewing container logs</h3>
<p>Finally, without attaching<a id="_idIndexMarker560"/> to a container, you can view<a id="_idIndexMarker561"/> the logs produced inside of it:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
docker logs my_nginx</pre> <p>Here, “logs” include anything routed to standard out, barring any specific configuration done inside the container.</p>
<p>Now that you have some idea what VMs and containers are all about, let’s look at the key differences between them and the questions to ask yourself when deciding which is appropriate to use.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-147"><a id="_idTextAnchor147"/>Key differences between VMs and containers and choosing between them</h2>
<p>There are several<a id="_idIndexMarker562"/> differences<a id="_idIndexMarker563"/> between VMs and containers that will often factor into deciding which to use:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Performance</strong>: Containers are generally faster and more resource-efficient than VMs. This is definitely true when thinking about how fast they start up, but it’s also true when they are running. Remember – a VM is simulating an entire computer while containers aren’t, and that simulation costs processor time and memory utilization on the host machine, all of which can impact the performance of the VM <em class="italic">and</em> the host.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Overhead</strong>: In a sense, this is another aspect of performance, but it’s different enough to call out. VMs have more overhead in terms of CPU, memory, storage, and other system resources, due to the need for a full OS in each instance. Containers are sharing the resources of the host more directly, so while they certainly do have some degree of overhead, it tends to be a lot lower than VMs.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Portability</strong>: Containers are highly portable across different machines, as long as they run the same OS kernel. In other words, the files inside a container have to work with the kernel in the host machine, and as long as they do, then a container can run on any machine. With a VM, this isn’t the case, which means they are even <em class="italic">more</em> portable than containers since you can run a Windows VM on a Linux host, a macOS VM on a Windows host, or any other combination you want.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Security</strong>: VMs offer more<a id="_idIndexMarker564"/> isolation, which can be beneficial<a id="_idIndexMarker565"/> for security, while containers offer enough isolation for most purposes but require careful management to ensure security. The complete isolation of VMs can provide a more secure environment, as one VM’s compromise doesn’t directly threaten others. Given that containers share the host OS’s kernel, it should be obvious that there is at least some possibility of security issues, and vulnerabilities in the kernel itself can potentially affect all containers. However, in practice, as long as you have an up-to-date host machine, and as long as your containers are configured properly, they are quite safe from a security standpoint.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Management and orchestration</strong>: VMs are often managed with pretty advanced management tools such as VMware vCenter or Microsoft System Center, which provide for centralized management of many VMs. Containers tend to be managed more often from a command prompt, though there definitely are graphical management tools as well. VM management tools allow for easy deployment, control, and scaling of VMs. Scaling means that if a VM needs more resources, it can be expanded, often on the fly. With containers, the answer more often than not is simply to create more instances of a given container and balance work between them. This is called orchestration, and it’s where more advanced <a id="_idIndexMarker566"/>things such as Kubernetes come into play. This is a Google product that allows for more flexible control of containers – things such as grouping them more efficiently to handle load. It’s a very powerful tool, but it’s also quite a bit more complex than the containers themselves.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Rapid deployment and scaling</strong>: I mentioned this in the previous bullet, but it’s an important point: because containers tend to start very fast and are more lightweight, containers can be started, stopped, and replicated quickly and easily, making them ideal for dynamic, scalable environments. VMs, by contrast, take longer to start and use more host resources. That means that for a given server, you can almost certainly run more containers than you can VMs, so if you start getting a lot of new users on your shiny new website, you can create more containers to handle traffic faster and easier and with fewer host requirements than with VMs.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, while there is certainly<a id="_idIndexMarker567"/> an overlap between VMs and<a id="_idIndexMarker568"/> containers, each has its unique strengths and weaknesses. VMs provide complete isolation with a full OS environment, making them suitable for applications that need a full OS or different OS types. But that makes them more heavyweight in terms of resource requirements.</p>
<p>Containers, being lighter and more efficient since they are not a complete running OS, are ideal for applications where portability and quick scaling are important. I would go so far as to say that today, it’s usually safer to start from the assumption that you’ll use containers more often than a VM for deploying an app or website (if you’re not going to simply run your code<a id="_idIndexMarker569"/> on a server, that is, which we tend to call <em class="italic">bare metal</em>). Especially in cases where you expect that your load requirements (how many users are using your website) might increase rapidly, containers are usually the better option (VMs can scale as well, but it’s a less efficient process). On the other hand, if absolute security is your main concern, and/or complete isolation from anything else that might be running on the same physical machine, then a VM is a very good option.</p>
<p>Now that you know a bit about containers and VMs, let’s talk about a place you may wind up running them (or just your “naked” application without VMs or containers at all), that being the cloud.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-148"><a id="_idTextAnchor148"/>Keeping your head in the clouds – cloud providers</h1>
<p>Some people like to be trite<a id="_idIndexMarker570"/> and say that the cloud just means running your code on someone else’s computer. And, I mean, it’s not <em class="italic">untrue</em>! But there’s much more to it than that.</p>
<p>The <strong class="bold">cloud</strong> refers to cloud computing, which<a id="_idIndexMarker571"/> is the delivery of various services over the internet, including data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software (read: your websites and applications). Cloud computing allows for flexible resources (meaning you can get just what you need when you need it), faster innovation (since you don’t need to build and configure servers and services yourself), and economies of scale (since the costs of building the infrastructure behind the cloud are amortized across all the people using it). You typically pay only for the cloud services you use, helping lower operating costs, run infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change.</p>
<p>Let’s say you <em class="italic">don’t</em> want to use the cloud. What that may mean is that you have to buy your own hardware, set it up, and configure the operating system and all the services on top of it (databases, mail services, user authentication services, web servers, and so on). Then, you have to put your code on it and run it, ensuring that the whole thing is secure. Then, if your website becomes super-popular and you start getting more traffic, you may then have to add hardware to expand the capacity or reconfigure the services to handle the added load. Eventually, you may have to add whole servers and configure networking in such a way that the load is balanced across them.</p>
<p>With the cloud, these sorts<a id="_idIndexMarker572"/> of concerns are automatic, or at least can be changed just by updating some settings on a control panel website offered by the cloud provider. You change some settings, click a button, and suddenly you have more memory, more bandwidth, and more CPU available to handle the expanded load. It’s a much easier thing to do. And the cost savings are significant: when you build your own server, you have to guess at the load, and it’s usually smart to over-purchase. If you think a server with a single 3 GHz CPU will be enough, you may want to buy a dual-processor machine up-front to have some headroom to grow. But, if you don’t grow, now you’ve effectively wasted money. With the cloud, you can add that second CPU when you see that you need it, so you’re not paying for one you don’t need or may not need for a while.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-149"><a id="_idTextAnchor149"/>Introducing cloud providers</h2>
<p>There are many different<a id="_idIndexMarker573"/> cloud providers<a id="_idIndexMarker574"/> these days, but the biggest are <strong class="bold">Amazon Web Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">AWS</strong>), <strong class="bold">Microsoft Azure</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Google Cloud Platform</strong> (<strong class="bold">GCP</strong>). Oracle also has a fairly popular cloud offering, as<a id="_idIndexMarker575"/> does IBM and some other smaller players, but Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are definitely the big boys. Ultimately, though, they all have the same basic proposition: run your code on their infrastructure, using only what you need.</p>
<p>It may be surprising to hear that the company that most people associate with the internet – Google – has a cloud offering that, it’s fair to say, isn’t quite as popular as AWS and Azure, which are the two most popular cloud providers as of this writing, almost without question. In fact, when someone talks about “the cloud” these days, they almost certainly mean one of those two providers. That’s how much larger they are than the rest in terms of usage and mindshare.</p>
<p>Regardless, though, all cloud<a id="_idIndexMarker576"/> providers offer a ton of different services, with a high degree of stability. Of course, that doesn’t come for free: using a public cloud can get rather expensive if you aren’t careful. It’s not at all difficult to find horror stories online of people waking up to huge AWS bills because their website got super-popular overnight. You definitely need to exercise caution when using them. Fortunately, all good cloud providers offer ways to control your spending. With AWS, for example, you can configure spending limits on your account so that you don’t get hit with a life-altering bill out of the blue.</p>
<p>It’s more than that, though: you have to think about whether the cloud is the right answer for a given use case at all. Sometimes, it more clearly is: when you know your load requirements will be highly variable, for example. Being able to use just the capacity you need is very appealing in such cases. Obviously, the complexity of setting up the various services cloud providers offer yourself can be overwhelming and very expensive in such cases.</p>
<p>But sometimes, having your own hardware is cheaper and simpler too, especially if you have a good idea of what your load will be over time. And if what you’re building doesn’t require most of what the cloud provides, then it might make more sense to do it yourself.</p>
<p>It’s not simple calculus and many, many factors go into such a decision, many of which are very project-dependent. I’m not trying to supply a checklist to use for such a decision here because that would be a nigh-impossible task. Instead, I’m just trying to make the point that the decision to go to the cloud or not is one you’ll need to make with every project based on its unique requirements. There are certainly benefits to the cloud, but there are negatives too.</p>
<p>Complicating matters more is that the cloud<a id="_idIndexMarker577"/> isn’t a single thing, regardless of whose cloud it is. There are effectively three types of clouds to be familiar with. Let’s talk about them now.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-150"><a id="_idTextAnchor150"/>Understanding cloud types</h2>
<p>The cloud can be public, private, or hybrid:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Public cloud</strong>: These are cloud services <a id="_idIndexMarker578"/>offered over the public<a id="_idIndexMarker579"/> internet, available to anyone willing to pay. The public cloud is generally services such as AWS, Azure, and GCP. They run in data centers provided by, maintained by, and completely controlled by the providers.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Private cloud</strong>: This is server infrastructure<a id="_idIndexMarker580"/> used exclusively <a id="_idIndexMarker581"/>by a single business or organization, making it available only to their internal development teams. This is typically done by larger companies who want or need a higher level of control over how things are done, especially in areas such as banking where regulations dictate a tighter level of control over sensitive data.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Hybrid cloud</strong>: Combines public and private<a id="_idIndexMarker582"/> clouds, bound together<a id="_idIndexMarker583"/> by technology allowing data and applications to be shared. Imagine running your website on your private cloud, but then having it connect to a database service in a public cloud in order to save some money (database software tends to be quite expensive at larger scales).</li>
</ul>
<p>And besides those three types, cloud services can break down into several key services too. Let’s look at just some of them now.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-151"><a id="_idTextAnchor151"/>Recognizing key services</h2>
<p>Cloud offerings come<a id="_idIndexMarker584"/> in many flavors, but they tend to come with names that end in “<strong class="bold">aaS</strong>,” which is short for “<strong class="bold">as a Service</strong>.” When you build a server yourself, and you need a database to run on it, you will need to install the database software and configure it. By contrast, <strong class="bold">DataBase as a Service</strong>, or <strong class="bold">DBaaS</strong>, is when a cloud provider<a id="_idIndexMarker585"/> offers preconfigured database services to you. You’ll still need to do some degree of configuration, of course, for your needs, but the basic database software is something you won’t have to worry about. From your perspective, it’s just a service you use, just like cable TV (uhh, does anyone actually still have cable TV?!)</p>
<p>Some of the other “aaS” offerings<a id="_idIndexMarker586"/> you may meet – but definitely not all of them since there seems to be a new one every week – include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</strong>: This is an offering of fundamental<a id="_idIndexMarker587"/> computing resources such as VMs, networking, and storage. An example of this is AWS <strong class="bold">Elastic Compute Cloud</strong> (<strong class="bold">EC2</strong>). This can largely be thought of as someone setting<a id="_idIndexMarker588"/> up a server for you, which you can then do what you want with.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Platform as a Service (PaaS)</strong>: This provides hardware<a id="_idIndexMarker589"/> and software tools over the internet. It is conceptually a level above IaaS in that it normally will include things such as an operating system and software installed on top of that.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Software as a Service (SaaS)</strong>: This service delivers software<a id="_idIndexMarker590"/> applications over the internet, on a subscription basis. One example is Microsoft Office 365, where you can use all of Microsoft’s Office applications over the internet.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Containers as a Service (CaaS)</strong>: This provides a runtime<a id="_idIndexMarker591"/> environment for containers of any type you wish to run.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS)</strong>: This is a service that you can use to back up your<a id="_idIndexMarker592"/> important data and restore it as necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>As I said, there are a myriad of other “aaS” offerings, and each cloud provider will have different options available. To complicate matters, the various providers won’t even always agree on the terminology! For example, <em class="italic">CaaS</em> may not mean <em class="italic">Container as a Service</em> in one cloud provider versus another. That said, the ones in this list tend to be fairly consistent and are probably the ones you’ll see most often.</p>
<p>Names aside, when you use the cloud, you may use just one service, or you may use many. AWS, for example, has upward of 200 services available as of this writing. But that’s another advantage of the cloud: you can mix and match services however you need, adding and subtracting as you go. It’s the Burger King model: have it your way!</p>
<p>Cloud computing’s flexibility, combined with its capacity for innovation, makes it a cornerstone of modern IT infrastructure, essential for businesses to remain competitive and agile in a rapidly evolving<a id="_idIndexMarker593"/> digital landscape.</p>
<p>But you may not need the cloud at all. Well, sort of. Let’s talk about something called serverless.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-152"><a id="_idTextAnchor152"/>Who even needs the cloud or even servers? – Serverless</h2>
<p>A fairly recent development<a id="_idIndexMarker594"/> in software development is something called <strong class="bold">serverless</strong>. This is still really a cloud offering, but it’s a fair bit different than the usual cloud. Generally speaking, with any cloud offering, you have some software running all the time. If no one uses it, it’s still running, albeit at a very low level because clouds can scale operations down at such times to save resources and ultimately save you money.</p>
<p>But, for some applications, you don’t even need that!</p>
<p>Imagine for a second that you want to write an application that can solve mathematical equations. Based on what you’ve learned so far, you can imagine creating a web page where you can enter a math equation and submit it to some server-side code to solve the equation and return the result. You can further imagine writing some Node code to do that work. And given what you’ve learned so far, you even have some idea what that might look like in terms of code, at least at a high level. Ultimately, you’re going to have a JS function that your Node server calls to solve the equation.</p>
<p>But what if I told you that there was a way to have just that function in the cloud and make it callable as if it were a server? Well, that’s exactly what serverless is!</p>
<p>Conceptually, you can think of serverless as a way to start that Node server only when a request comes in, let it call that function, return a result, and then immediately shut down. But that all happens so fast that you can’t even tell – it looks to you like the server is always running.</p>
<p>But, better still, while the code isn’t very complex, as you’ve seen, wouldn’t it be better if you didn’t even have to write the server code? Wouldn’t it be better if you only had to write the function that solves the equations?</p>
<p>That’s serverless in a nutshell!</p>
<p>AWS Lambda is one such serverless service. With it, you can write functions, not just in JS but in a whole host of languages. These functions are then callable as if they were running on a server. Lambda takes care of all the plumbing, so to speak – all the code you would need to write yourself to make a server. You just focus on the logic needed and let Lambda take care of the rest. And, best of all, since there isn’t code running all the time awaiting requests, you aren’t paying anything if your functions aren’t being called. You’ll just pay when they’re called, based on how many resources they use. So, if you write fast, efficient code, it’ll cost you less to run them serverless.</p>
<p>Of course, serverless isn’t a suitable model for all applications. But, for the ones where it makes sense, it can make <em class="italic">a lot</em> of sense.</p>
<p>The cloud is an expansive topic and one you may or may not wind up needing to get deeper into, depending on your needs. But the last topic I want to touch on plays into almost everything we’ve discussed so far because whether you build your own server or use a cloud provider, you’re obviously going to need to do things such as build your code into a runnable form<a id="_idIndexMarker595"/> and deploy it, and all of that, and more, is the domain of DevOps.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-153"><a id="_idTextAnchor153"/>Taking back control – DevOps</h1>
<p>The world of <strong class="bold">Information Technology</strong> (<strong class="bold">IT</strong>), of which web<a id="_idIndexMarker596"/> development <a id="_idIndexMarker597"/>is one part, is an interesting field in that technologies and approaches come and go all the time. What also tends to happen is we repeat ourselves! Someone has a good idea; it becomes popular but eventually is supplanted by something else. Then, somewhere down the road, someone has another good idea that becomes popular, but anyone who was around for the last good idea often realizes the new good idea is actually just the old good idea slightly updated and wrapped in new clothes!</p>
<p>In the early days, developers did it all. We wrote the code, and then we were the ones who deployed it, meaning installed it onto the server it ran on (whether they were servers we built, servers provided by outside vendors, or the cloud). This was just part of the development process. We then worried about things such as monitoring a website for issues and dealing with those issues.</p>
<p>After a while, though, a lot of organizations started taking a different approach by separating out some of those duties and assigning them to groups<a id="_idIndexMarker598"/> other than developers, typically called the operations team. At that point, developers still wrote the code, but when it came time to deploy it, another group would do that. Things such as monitoring might be handled by an entirely different group, and dealing with issues that came up at least started with a specific support group (though developers still frequently had to get involved ultimately).</p>
<p>Now, the pendulum is starting to swing the other way again in that developers commonly have a hand in deployments and support and all the other concerns that go into running a live website, so we’re repeating ourselves again, though with a few differences. The “new clothes” this time around is something called DevOps.</p>
<p><strong class="bold">DevOps</strong> is a set of practices that combines <strong class="bold">software development</strong> (<strong class="bold">Dev</strong>) and <strong class="bold">IT operations</strong> (<strong class="bold">Ops</strong>), aiming to shorten the development life cycle and provide continuous delivery of software of websites while still delivering high-quality output (generally meaning fewer bugs or other issues relative to the speed at which updates are delivered). DevOps is notable for its emphasis on collaboration, automation, and integration between software developers and IT professionals. It often involves tools for automating and streamlining the integration and deployment processes, aiming to improve and speed up delivery. This approach is particularly relevant in the context of agile software development, an approach where you build software in many phases that each deliver a part of the expected whole while allowing for changes as development progresses. It can significantly enhance<a id="_idIndexMarker599"/> the efficiency and quality of software production and maintenance as a result.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-154"><a id="_idTextAnchor154"/>Understanding the key aspects of DevOps</h2>
<p>There are several key points<a id="_idIndexMarker600"/> to DevOps at a high level:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Culture shift</strong>: DevOps emphasizes a shift in mindset, encouraging collaboration between development and operations teams. This breaks down silos and fosters a culture where building, testing, and releasing software happens rapidly, frequently, and more reliably.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Automation</strong>: DevOps relies heavily on automation to speed up software development and deployment processes. This includes code deployments, testing, infrastructure provisioning, monitoring, and more. Anything that can be automated and run with little or no human intervention is something DevOps will typically seek to do.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)</strong>: These are core practices in DevOps. <strong class="bold">CI</strong> refers to the process<a id="_idIndexMarker601"/> of automatically integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project. <strong class="bold">CD</strong> is an extension of this, where the software can be released to production at any time. The basic idea is that as developers push code to Git, automation will see that new code and will build the software or website and deploy it to a test environment. Frequently, automated tests are run at that point, and developers are alerted to failures so that they can correct issues. If no issues are found, and if everything is configured for it, the new code can be deployed immediately to a production environment for end users to start using immediately.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Monitoring and feedback</strong>: Continuous monitoring of the application and its performance is crucial, especially with so much being automated and more rapid deployments being done. It helps in identifying issues early and helps improve the product in real time based on user feedback and system-level tests. For example, if new code is deployed and you have monitoring in place that alerts you to errors that begin happening, you can take action possibly even before users become aware that there is an issue.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Tools and technologies</strong>: DevOps in general, and CI/CD in <a id="_idIndexMarker602"/>particular, come with a host of new tools to make it all happen. Names such as Jenkins and GitLab come up, which are platforms for running what are called <strong class="bold">pipelines</strong>. A pipeline is really just a fancy<a id="_idIndexMarker603"/> way of saying some scripts that know how to build, test, and deploy your code automatically. Of course, containers play a large role in all of this. For example, a CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy your code may involve the pipeline automatically creating a container temporarily to do the build-in. Other products such as Ansible or Puppet are also often used. These are tools for managing the configuration of environments, often servers. For example, the CI/CD pipeline might execute an Ansible job, which handles ensuring the configuration of your production server meets the needs of your application. Getting into DevOps involves learning about many new tools and technologies beyond those needed to design websites and write code.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Microservices architecture</strong>: One way that many DevOps teams follow to make dealing with the code they manage easier is to adopt a microservices architecture. This is a way of building applications and websites that breaks them down into many smaller pieces, each providing a needed service to the larger application. For example, you may create a microservice that validates users during login. You may create another that handles registering new users. Rather than rolling both these services up as part of your website, you instead can deploy them as separate applications that the website then makes use of. This allows you to upgrade the registration service without touching the login validation service. This architecture is a natural fit for the DevOps approach because automating these smaller pieces tends to be easier. The trade-off is that making all the pieces work together can sometimes be challenging, and it does tend to make tracking down problems a bit more difficult. But, the benefits oftentimes outweigh any negatives, including the fact that you can scale up services individually to handle greater needs as they <a id="_idIndexMarker604"/>develop easier than trying to scale up a single large – <strong class="bold">monolithic</strong>, as they’re known – application. It can also help teams get features out faster since there is less risk in adding a new service or updating<a id="_idIndexMarker605"/> a single service without touching the code of another.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-155"><a id="_idTextAnchor155"/>Determining the benefits of DevOps (and some negatives)</h2>
<p>There are several<a id="_idIndexMarker606"/> benefits to DevOps.</p>
<p>One is the ability to increase deployment frequency (since it’s all automated and in most cases will simply run faster than a human doing it). Teams that implement CI/CD pipelines will often release changes in days or weeks, while teams that don’t use a DevOps mindset may take weeks or months between releases. There are even some companies that deploy code daily, and that would be nearly impossible to do – assuming they want a stable product – without DevOps.</p>
<p>Faster <strong class="bold">time to market</strong> (<strong class="bold">TTM</strong>) is another key benefit. With <a id="_idIndexMarker607"/>everything automated, teams can focus more on writing code than worrying about how it will ultimately get deployed and run.</p>
<p>DevOps also usually allows for a lower failure rate of new releases, at least when done properly. This is primarily because testing is usually built into CI/CD pipelines, and assuming the tests are robust enough, you can be fairly well assured that new code doesn’t break anything, and you can therefore have confidence releasing it faster.</p>
<p>In general, in your role as a web developer, you will likely find that DevOps practices not only streamline the development process but also enhance the overall quality and responsiveness of software maintenance and deployment.</p>
<p>Of course, few things in life are all unicorns and rainbows! Even the best of ideas tend to have some downside, and DevOps is no different.</p>
<p>It can become incredibly frustrating when your carefully developed automation suddenly fails. Maybe it relies on a service to compile code, for example, and maybe that service is down for some reason. All of a sudden, your pipelines fail, and maybe they don’t provide detailed enough error information to immediately see what the problem is. Perhaps the admins upgraded Jenkins, and the new version has a bug that breaks your pipeline in some very difficult-to-troubleshoot way. Or, maybe there are a lot of teams running pipelines at once, and all of a sudden, your pipeline takes 2 hours instead of 5 minutes. Maybe it’s simply difficult to write the pipeline script to work exactly the way you need because it has some limitations you discovered the hard way.</p>
<p>All of these are things I’ve run into in my work, and that’s just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>As I alluded to earlier, the microservices<a id="_idIndexMarker608"/> architecture has many benefits, but troubleshooting them when something goes wrong is definitely not one of them. And matters get much worse when you have services maintained by several different teams. Now, not only do you have the difficulty of figuring out which service is at fault, but now you have to interface with that team and get them to correct the issue, and that isn’t always as smooth a situation as you might hope.</p>
<p>But, at the end of the day, most developers tend to agree that the benefits of DevOps far outweigh any negatives.</p>
<p>Now that you have some insight into DevOps, let’s talk about a technology that is often used in the context of DevOps: Python.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-156"><a id="_idTextAnchor156"/>It’s not all about HTML, CSS, and JS – Python</h2>
<p><strong class="bold">Python</strong> is a high-level, interpreted<a id="_idIndexMarker609"/> programming language known for its readability and simplicity. Developed by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Its key features include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Easy to learn</strong>: Python has a straightforward<a id="_idIndexMarker610"/> syntax that is similar to the English language, which makes it easy for most people to pick up quickly</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Dynamic typing</strong>: Variables can change their type based on the value assigned</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Memory management</strong>: Automatic memory management and garbage collection</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Extensive standard library</strong>: A large standard library with modules for various tasks</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Cross-platform</strong>: Runs on multiple OSs such as Windows, macOS, and Linux</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Interpreted</strong>: Code is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Multiparadigm</strong>: Supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Extensibility</strong>: Can be extended with C/C++ for performance-critical tasks</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Embeddable</strong>: Can be embedded within C/C++ programs to give scripting capabilities</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Community</strong>: A large and active community supporting development and offering numerous modules and libraries</li>
</ul>
<p>Python is used in various domains such as web development, data science, <strong class="bold">artificial intelligence</strong> (<strong class="bold">AI</strong>), <strong class="bold">machine learning</strong> (<strong class="bold">ML</strong>), networking, and more. Its frameworks such as Django and Flask are popular for web development, while libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow are extensively used in scientific computing and AI.</p>
<p>It’s also a popular language in the realm of DevOps. You’ll often find various scripts written in Python that are then executed from CI/CD pipelines or other automation tooling. It’s definitely not required for DevOps, and sometimes other languages and facilities are used in favor of it, but for sure it’s a popular option in DevOps circles.</p>
<p>Let’s look at some basic Python example code, just to give you some idea of what it’s like.</p>
<h3>Examining some simple Python</h3>
<p>Python is an expansive<a id="_idIndexMarker611"/> language, at least as complex as JS, and probably more so, honestly. Entire books have been written about Python, so there’s no way I could possibly teach you everything about Python in one chapter. But I want to give you at least a taste of what it looks like and what it can do. To do this, I’m going to show you an admittedly contrived example of something you might write as part of a CI/CD pipeline for a website. I think, given your exposure to JS thus far, that you’ll find Python pretty understandable even without delving into the details of it, which is one of the reasons it’s become so popular.</p>
<p>So, take a look at the contents of the <code>build_and_deploy.py</code> file:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
import os
import shutil
import datetime
def make_index(source_path):
    current_time = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    head = '&lt;head&gt;&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;&lt;/head&gt;'
    with open(os.path.join(source_path, 'index.html'), 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"&lt;html&gt;{head}&lt;body&gt;{current_time}&lt;/html&gt;")
    print("index.html created")
def deploy(source_path, deploy_path):
    if os.path.exists(deploy_path):
        print("Deleting existing deployment")
        shutil.rmtree(deploy_path)
    shutil.copytree(source_path, deploy_path)
    print("Website deployed")
# Execution begins here
source_path = "src"
deploy_path = "live"
make_index(source_path)
deploy(source_path, deploy_path)</pre> <p>First, a couple of libraries are imported<a id="_idIndexMarker612"/> for our Python script to use: the <code>os</code> and <code>shutil</code> libraries for working with the operating system and filesystem, and <code>datetime</code> so that we can get the current date and time.</p>
<p>Next, two functions named <code>make_index()</code> and <code>deploy()</code> are defined (that’s what the <code>def</code> keyword means in Python). The <code>make_index()</code> function writes a file named <code>index.html</code> into the <code>src</code> directory (the directory to write to is passed in as <code>source_path</code>), and <code>deploy()</code> is responsible for creating our final deployment directory (which, in this contrived example, we presume a web server uses to serve content).</p>
<p>Inside <code>make_index()</code>, a variable named <code>current_time</code> is defined with a value returned to us by a call to the <code>datetime.datetime.now()</code> function, which is made available to us from the imported <code>datetime</code> library. The <code>strftime()</code> function allows us to specify the format of the date and time we want – in this case, a string in the form <code>YYYY-MM-FF HH:MM:SS</code> (so, for example, <code>2023-12-10 18:10:53</code>).</p>
<p>Next, another variable named <code>head</code> is defined that contains the HTML for the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of our HTML document. In it, the <code>styles.css</code> file is imported, which you’ll find already exists in the <code>src</code> directory. The style configuration in it is simply <code>body { color : #ff0000; }</code> to make all the text in the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> section red.</p>
<p>After that, the <code>index.html</code> file is written, and the value of <code>head</code> is inserted into it, giving us a proper <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section in our HTML document. Because the string passed to the <code>file.write()</code> function that writes to the file is defined starting with <code>f"</code>, we can use replacement tokens inside, as with <code>{head}</code>. Python will insert the value of the <code>head</code> variable there for us. Another replacement token, <code>{current_time}</code>, does the same, so we’ll see the current date and time when the page is loaded (well, current as of when we built the site, that is).</p>
<p>Finally, the <code>print()</code> statement echoes a status message to the console when we run the script.</p>
<p>Inside the <code>deploy()</code> function, it first checks to see if the site is already deployed by checking for the <code>live</code> directory, as specified in the <code>deploy_path</code> argument. If it does, then the <code>shutil.rmtree()</code> function is used to delete the directory, and a status message reflecting that is displayed via <code>print()</code>. Then, whether the directory was deleted or not, <code>shutil.copytree()</code> is used to create the deployment directory. More specifically, it copies the contents of the <code>src</code> directory – specified by the <code>source_path</code> argument – into the deployment directory. Finally, a status message is shown with <code>print()</code> again.</p>
<p>When you run this script, the execution<a id="_idIndexMarker613"/> actually begins down at the bottom where you see the comment, which is denoted by the line beginning with a hash symbol. First, the source and deployment directories are defined as the <code>source_path</code> and <code>deploy_path</code> variables. Then, <code>make_index()</code> is called, which results in the <code>index.html</code> file being written into the <code>src</code> directory. Finally, <code>deploy()</code> is called, which will ensure we have a brand new deployment directory named <code>live</code>, and in it will be the <code>index.html</code> and <code>styles.css</code> files. We now effectively have a full –albeit very simple – website in the <code>live</code> directory, and if a web server is pointed at that directory, the website will be available for visitors.</p>
<p>Finally, to run the script, assuming you have Python installed, you simply execute this command at a command prompt:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
py build_and_deploy.py</pre> <p>The <code>py</code> command should have been made available as a result of installing Python. Give it a shot!</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, there is a lot more to Python than this simple example shows. However, it demonstrates many of the key concepts, including variables, functions, libraries, comments, conditionals, and the basic structure of a Python script. And this example shows something that you might conceivably want to execute in a CI/CD pipeline. Imagine if this script is automatically executed every time you push new code to Git, which is something typically done with CI/CD pipelines.</p>
<p>With that, you could have your new code deployed to a live web server for all the world to see, all automatically. That’s the power <a id="_idIndexMarker614"/>of DevOps and Python together!</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-157"><a id="_idTextAnchor157"/>Reviewing the roadmap</h1>
<p>Ah, we’re moving right along, revealing squares like mad! Here’s the updated web developer roadmap:</p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.15: The roadmap with a few more boxes filled in</p>
<p>This time, you uncovered the <strong class="bold">Graphic Design</strong>, <strong class="bold">DevOps</strong>, <strong class="bold">UX</strong>, <strong class="bold">Python</strong>, <strong class="bold">VMs and Containers</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Cloud Infrastructure</strong> boxes. That was a big one! Let’s keep going, and before long, we’ll have them all revealed.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-158"><a id="_idTextAnchor158"/>Summary</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we covered several unique areas. First, you looked at some frontend concerns, including graphic design, usability, and responsive design, to get a feel for why they’re important and how they benefit you in your web development journey. We then moved to the server side and talked about VMs and containers a bit to see how they are used to run your code. You then got a look at the cloud and learned what that’s about. Finally, we talked about DevOps a bit to understand how this popular approach to development enhances our ability to deliver quality code. As part of that discussion, you got a look at Python and played with it a little bit to see what it offers, especially as related to DevOps.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we’ll jump back onto the frontend and focus on some of the biggest frameworks in use today, seeing how they provide you with a head start in your development and allow you to deliver more robust websites while reducing the effort to do so.</p>
