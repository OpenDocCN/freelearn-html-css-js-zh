<h1 id="_idParaDest-130"><a id="_idTextAnchor130"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.2.1">Understanding the User Experience, Deployment Options, and DevOps</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">In this chapter, we’re going to discuss a few other “random” topics, but that randomness really falls into two categories: the look, feel, and function of your site, and some options for deploying it to run for real. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">Admittedly, they are two different gears, but they mesh together in that you want any website you build to look good and work well, but obviously, that won’t be the case if you can’t build and eventually deploy it somewhere that others </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">can access.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">Here, you’ll learn about ways to make your website attractive while ensuring it is functional for as wide an audience as possible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">These are important considerations because users are attracted to websites that look good. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">But, then again, looking good doesn’t much matter if the website can’t really be used by them effectively, so both are </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">key considerations.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">You’ll then learn about </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">virtual machines</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">VMs</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">), containers, and the cloud, all of which play into the notion of where and how to run your website because it has to run somewhere for people to access it! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.2">These options provide the flexibility and stability you need when putting a website online for all the world </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">to see.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">Finally, you’ll learn a bit about DevOps, which is the modern approach to managing those deployments, as well as how you build your website from source code to final form. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.2">This is important because as a website gets more complex, so does the difficulty involved in keeping everything straight and ensuring you deliver high-quality results for your clients, and DevOps can help </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">with that.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">This chapter, therefore, will cover the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">following topics:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">Later in this chapter, we’re going to be talking about something called VMs and something called containers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.2">As part of that discussion, I’m going to show you some basic container functionality. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.3">To follow along, you’ll need to do </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">two things.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">First, go to </span><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">https://www.virtualbox.org</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1"> and download and install</span><a id="_idIndexMarker422"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1"> Oracle VirtualBox. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.2">This is a program that lets you run VMs (whatever </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">those are!).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">Once that’s installed, head over to </span><a href="https://www.osboxes.org/ubuntu"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">https://www.osboxes.org/ubuntu</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1"> and download the 23.10 Ubuntu Linux</span><a id="_idIndexMarker423"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1"> VirtualBox image. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">Just keep those at the ready </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">for later!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">Finally, we’re going to lightly touch on Python, another programming language that developers often use. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.2">For that, you’ll need to install it on your system so that you can play with the sample code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.3">To do so, head over to </span><a href="https://www.python.org"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">https://www.python.org</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1"> and download</span><a id="_idIndexMarker424"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1"> and install the version appropriate for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">your system.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">You’ll also want to make sure you have the source code bundle for this book downloaded (as explained in </span><a href="B18315_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor082"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">Chapter 3</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">) and the </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">ch05/1-python</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1"> directory at </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">the ready.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-132"><a id="_idTextAnchor132"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">Understanding what makes a website look pretty – graphic design</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">Okay, so you’ve built a website</span><a id="_idIndexMarker425"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1"> that works. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.2">That’s a fine accomplishment to be sure, but what does it </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">look</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1"> like? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">Is it attractive? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.3">Is it pleasing to the eye? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.4">Is it a work of art? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.5">Answering those questions requires delving into the realm of graphic design. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.6">But, contrary to what you might think from my using the word “art” there, it’s </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">surprisingly scientific!</span></span></p>
<p><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">Graphic design</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">, in simplest terms, is the application</span><a id="_idIndexMarker426"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1"> of certain techniques and knowledge about human psychology and even physiology to create visual content that communicates messages and does so in a way that is considered visually pleasing to many people. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.2">It blends creativity and technology to convey ideas through various visual means and plays a crucial role in branding, marketing, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">media production.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">Graphic designers – as well as web developers who very often find themselves playing the role – use various tools and software to create visual compositions (in our case, web development tools), which</span><a id="_idIndexMarker427"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1"> certainly include HTML, CSS, and even </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">JavaScript</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">JS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.2">While graphic design </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">is</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1"> rooted in art, a good design often considers principles such as balance, contrast, and hierarchy to ensure effective communication. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.2">This is the “science” part </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">I mentioned.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">While graphic design, by and large, is about visual appeal – essentially, whether what’s on the screen looks pleasing – there’s also an element of usability to it. </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">Usability</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1"> refers to the ability of users</span><a id="_idIndexMarker428"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1"> to get work done efficiently with a given human-tool interface, where “tool” here can mean a website. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.2">That idea gets into something called </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">UX</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1"> – this is a topic that will be</span><a id="_idIndexMarker429"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1"> coming in the next section, but it revolves around things such as whether the user can navigate a website efficiently, whether the website meets their expectations in terms of functionality, and a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">lot more.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">As an example of usability, if you have light-green text on a light-yellow background, that will likely be hard for a user to read, making the website less usable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">Another example is animated backgrounds, which are all the rage on the web these days. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.3">They look great, but if you don’t properly consider the content that you’re putting on top of them, then you may make consuming that content much more difficult for users. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.4">You might disorient some users, even potentially making them feel sick. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.5">Applying graphic design principles in such scenarios can help you make the design look good while also maintaining </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">solid usability.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">Let’s look at the key areas that make up graphic </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">design now.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-133"><a id="_idTextAnchor133"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">Understanding key graphic design areas</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">Graphic design</span><a id="_idIndexMarker430"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1"> touches on several areas, including </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">the following:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">Typography</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">: This includes things such</span><a id="_idIndexMarker431"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1"> as effective font choices, line lengths, and spacing, with the goal of making content readable and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">visually appealing.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">Layout and print design</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">: This is all about arranging</span><a id="_idIndexMarker432"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1"> visual elements in space effectively, ensuring that there is a pleasing use of negative space (empty areas) to highlight content better, and effective alignment of elements to make scanning content easier on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">the user.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">Branding and logo design</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">: Proper branding and logo design</span><a id="_idIndexMarker433"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1"> create a visual identity</span><a id="_idIndexMarker434"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1"> for companies or products. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.2">This also includes color </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">palette choice.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">Motion graphics</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">: Not all graphics are static, especially</span><a id="_idIndexMarker435"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1"> nowadays on the web. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.2">Adding elements of animation can elevate a design greatly, but there is a fine line between elevation and distraction, and that balance must </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">be maintained.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">While graphic design techniques and tools evolve constantly, along with the technology used to implement designs, the core of graphic design always remains true: the visual communication of a message or ideas, effectively and aesthetically, and for the web, it also plays a big role in making a website more usable for users, meaning less frustrating and distracting from </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">their goals.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">There exists a set of principles that can guide you in your graphic design duties called the Gestalt Principles, which we’ll look </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">at now.</span></span></p>

<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">Proximity</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">: Elements that are close</span><a id="_idIndexMarker437"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1"> to each other are often perceived as related or grouped together. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.2">In graphic design for the web, related buttons or menu items are often placed close to one another to visually communicate that they are related functionally. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.3">In </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">Figure 5</span></em></span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">.1</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">, notice how your mind groups the twelve squares on the left, the three squares in the upper right, and the three screens</span><a id="_idIndexMarker438"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1"> in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">the center:</span></span></li>

<p class="list-inset"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">As another example, sizing icons or buttons on a website gives a sense of related functionality and allows the user to build a mental model that says, “Things that look like this</span><a id="_idIndexMarker440"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1"> are buttons, and I can click them,” which helps make the website </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">more usable.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.1">In the previous section, we briefly </span><a id="_idIndexMarker449"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.1">discussed graphic design, and I mentioned that graphic design has a role to play in something called UX. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.2">Let’s dive into that topic in more </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.1">detail now.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.1">UX refers to a person’s overall experience when interacting with a product, system, or service, especially in terms of how easy or pleasing it is to use. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.2">It’s concerned with their perception of a product, with the ultimate goal being to make them happy using the thing you produce both before, during, and after </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.1">using it.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.1">UX is an iterative process where you research, plan, test, and then refine the various touch points a person has with a product, trying to move closer to those goals with each iteration. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.2">It’s not about guesswork; it tends to be very scientific. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.3">You can guess which features of a product will make users happy, but those guesses – which should be based on research – are just a starting point. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.4">You then need to put the product in front of people, see how they interact with it, get their feedback, and then tweak the product based on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.1">that feedback.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.1">UX isn’t a web development or even a computer thing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.2">In fact, one of the most famous books on UX ever, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.1">The Design of Everyday Things</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.1"> by Don Norman, barely even talks about computers, let alone websites – it spends more time talking about teapots and turn signals in your car! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.2">That’s because UX applies to how humans interact with any piece of technology, or really any object more generally. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.3">But, specifically within the context of digital design, UX focuses</span><a id="_idIndexMarker450"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.1"> on the user’s journey through a website or application. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.2">So, let’s take a closer look at </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.1">the topic.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.1">Here are some of the key concepts that </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.1">comprise UX:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.1">Usability</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.1">: This is about how user-friendly </span><a id="_idIndexMarker451"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.1">and intuitive the interface is. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.2">It includes ideas such as ease of learning (are users able to discover, without reading documentation, how your app works?), efficiency of use (can users get work done with a minimum of steps?), memorability, error frequency, severity and how easily they can recover from errors, and overall </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.1">user satisfaction.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.1">Interaction design</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.1">: This involves designing</span><a id="_idIndexMarker452"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.1"> interactive digital products, environments, systems, and services. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.2">It’s about creating interfaces with well-thought-out behaviors. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.3">One thing you never want to do with any software product is to surprise users. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.4">It should be obvious what a button will do if they click it; they shouldn’t have to guess. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.5">Interaction design largely defines </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.1">this idea.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.1">User research</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.1">: Understanding the users’ needs, motivations, and</span><a id="_idIndexMarker453"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.1"> behaviors through methods such as surveys, interviews, and usability testing (oftentimes, you’ll literally watch users interact with your website to look for things such as if they get frustrated trying to navigate it). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.2">This research informs design decisions, especially as you iterate </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.1">the design.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.1">Information architecture (IA)</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.1">: This is about structuring, organizing, and</span><a id="_idIndexMarker454"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.1"> labeling content</span><a id="_idIndexMarker455"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.1"> effectively and sustainably. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.2">Good IA helps users find information and complete tasks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.3">One common</span><a id="_idIndexMarker456"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.1"> tool for IA is a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.1">card-sorting</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.1"> exercise. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.2">Let’s say you have several topics to be covered on a website, and some of them are sub-topics of others. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.3">To organize this, you might write every topic on a literal note card, then arrange the top-level topics in a line, and then put the sub-topics </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.1">beneath them.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.250.1">Content strategy</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.1">: This involves planning, creating, delivering, and</span><a id="_idIndexMarker457"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.1"> managing content. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.2">Content should be relevant and useful to users, and you should look to minimize extraneous content that might just confuse them or get in the way. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.3">In graphic design, the idea of negative space is important, which is knowing when </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.1">not</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.1"> to put something on the screen. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.2">There is value in empty space sometimes, but by the same token, there can be value in </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.1">not</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.1"> providing information when it won’t help a user achieve their primary goal. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.2">The company Apple is a great example of this: it tends to minimize options available to users. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.3">This can be frustrating for some more advanced users, but for typical users, it actually aids them because the phenomenon of </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.1">analysis paralysis</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.1"> is avoided by not overloading</span><a id="_idIndexMarker458"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.1"> them with options. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.2">This applies</span><a id="_idIndexMarker459"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.1"> not only to options but to information </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.1">as well.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.1">User feedback</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.1">: Continuous collection of user feedback</span><a id="_idIndexMarker460"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.1"> is crucial for iterative improvement of the UX. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.2">Of course, when initially designing and building a website, it’s helpful to get that feedback so that you can make changes as you go. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.3">However, seeking user feedback shouldn’t stop after the site is live. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.4">There’s always room for improvement, but you shouldn’t go about this blindly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.5">Hearing from your users is a good way to get the information you need to make improvements based on data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.6">User feedback can be direct – things such as surveys users can fill out – or indirect – perhaps by looking at metrics about things such as how often users click a help link, for example. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.7">If you find that every user that visits your site looks for help or, worse, abandons the site before doing something meaningful, that’s a form of feedback that is probably telling you your site isn’t as easy to use as you might have thought. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.8">Analytics and performance</span><a id="_idIndexMarker461"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.1"> data are, therefore, an aspect </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.1">of this.</span></span></li>

<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.331.1">Interaction animation</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.1">: Subtle animations can improve</span><a id="_idIndexMarker475"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.333.1"> the UX by providing feedback, demonstrating cause and effect, and adding a layer of polish and professionalism to the interaction. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.333.2">We talked about this in the graphic design section, but it’s worth calling out as it relates to usability because animation can be a divisive topic. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.333.3">Too much animation will actually annoy and frustrate users and maybe even make them sick, but too little will often yield a design that isn’t as pleasing to use as one with just the right amount used. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.333.4">Given all of this, that’s why the use of animation to reflect interactions is important enough to be its own </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.334.1">key topic.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.335.1">Visual design</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.336.1">: Although distinct from</span><a id="_idIndexMarker476"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.337.1"> UX, visual design (how things look) impacts UX. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.337.2">It includes typography, color schemes, and layout. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.337.3">Effectively, this means the same as graphic design, then, but it’s worth being aware of the term since you may hear both at </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.1">various times.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.1">Incorporating these aspects of UX into your work can greatly enhance the quality and user satisfaction of the software products you develop or architect. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.2">In your role as a web developer, integrating UX principles into your development process can significantly enhance the end product’s effectiveness, efficiency, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.1">user satisfaction.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.1">While in some organizations, there </span><a id="_idIndexMarker477"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.1">will be an entirely separate group responsible for UX, that won’t always be the case, and even when it is, it makes a lot of sense for you as a developer to have some grasp of these concepts, if for no other reason than to be better able to interface with such </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.1">separate groups.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.1">If you remember only one thing from all of this, let it be this: users are what it’s all about! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.2">You have to base your design decisions on what they need, what they want, and what makes them happy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.3">And you need to make those decisions based on good research and testing, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.1">not assumptions.</span></span></p>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-137"><a id="_idTextAnchor137"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.1">Considering accessibility</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.349.1">Accessibility is, in a sense, another</span><a id="_idIndexMarker478"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.1"> aspect of UX, but it’s a large enough concern to be its </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.351.1">own topic.</span></span></p>
<p><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.352.1">Accessibility</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.353.1">, in the context of digital</span><a id="_idIndexMarker479"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.1"> design, refers to the practice of making your websites and applications usable by as many people as possible, including those with disabilities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.2">This encompasses a wide range of conditions, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.1">neurological disabilities.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.1">Here are some key points</span><a id="_idIndexMarker480"/> <span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.357.1">to consider:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.1">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.1">: These are part of a series of web accessibility</span><a id="_idIndexMarker481"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.360.1"> guidelines published by the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.1">World Wide Web Consortium</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.1">W3C</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.364.1">) (</span><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.365.1">https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.366.1">), consisting of a set</span><a id="_idIndexMarker482"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.367.1"> of recommendations for making web content more accessible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.367.2">They encompass many points that you can follow to help make your sites accessible to various user groups with </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.368.1">different needs.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.369.1">Assistive technologies’ compatibility (screen readers and alternative (alt) text devices)</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.370.1">: Websites should be designed so that screen readers can easily interpret and read out the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker483"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.371.1">content. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.371.2">You want to ensure compatibility with various assistive technologies such as screen readers, speech recognition software, and screen magnifier tools. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.371.3">A simple example of this is providing alt text for images: </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.372.1">&lt;img src="companyLogo.png" alt="This is a company logo showing an eagle with a fish in its beak"&gt;</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.373.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.373.2">Someone who is blind and is using a screen reader will have the alt text read out to them, providing a description of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.1">the logo.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.375.1">Keyboard navigation</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.1">: Ensure that all interactive elements on a website can be accessed and used through keyboard controls, which is crucial for users who cannot use a mouse. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.2">This is generally easy to achieve and to a large extent happens automatically thanks to web browsers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.3">The one thing you need to keep in mind, though, is relatively simple things such as the order of elements on a form. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.4">An HTML form – unless you do something wrong – should be keyboard-navigable by default. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.5">But if you don’t put the elements of the form in a logical order, what can happen is you can make elements that most users need to access more difficult to get to via the keyboard. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.6">For example, on a user registration form that needs a person’s first and last name, you probably don’t want to put the last name at the end of the form with 10 other fields between it and the first name field at </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.377.1">the top.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.378.1">Visual design</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.1">: This includes considerations</span><a id="_idIndexMarker484"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.380.1"> for color contrast to aid users with color blindness or visual impairments, as well as ensuring text size and spacing are adjustable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.380.2">Some of this again comes for free with web browsers, unless you write bad code that gets in the way. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.380.3">But some elements of design come into play too – things such as using colors for text that work well against background colors, as a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.1">simple example.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.382.1">Captioning and transcripts</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.1">: Supply captions for video content and transcripts for audio content is essential for users who are deaf or hard </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.1">of hearing.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.1">Consistent navigation</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.1">: Keep navigation consistent throughout the site helps users with cognitive disabilities to better understand and interact with the content. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.2">This is, of course, good for users who aren’t disabled too, though the difference is that someone with disabilities may be unable to use your site while someone without disabilities may simply not like using your site. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.3">The former is worse, but the latter isn’t </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.1">much better!</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.1">Error identification and instructions</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.1">: Make sure that errors are clearly identified and instructions</span><a id="_idIndexMarker485"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.390.1"> are provided to help users understand how to complete tasks, such as filling out forms. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.390.2">You never want to insult your users first of all, so simple things such as the wording of error messages are a factor. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.390.3">For example, writing “A first name is required” is probably better than “You didn’t enter a first name.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.390.4">But more than that, you want to ensure that your error messages and instructions clearly describe what needs to be done as succinctly as possible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.390.5">This is harder than it sounds and is a place where good user research is </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.1">very helpful.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.1">Legal compliance</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.393.1">: In many regions, there are legal requirements for digital accessibility, such as the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.1">Americans with Disabilities Act</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.395.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.1">ADA</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.1">) in the US. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.2">That means that what we’re talking</span><a id="_idIndexMarker486"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.398.1"> about here isn’t just good; it’s legally </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.1">necessary</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.1"> in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.401.1">many cases.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.402.1">Incorporating accessibility into your software development and design processes not only expands your user base but also reflects a commitment to inclusivity and legal compliance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.402.2">As a software developer/architect, considering accessibility from the outset of a project can significantly enhance the usability and reach of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.403.1">your applications.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.1">One final topic I want to discuss</span><a id="_idIndexMarker487"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.1"> within the context of UX is something that very often plays into designing for mobile devices (though not exclusively), and that’s </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.406.1">responsive design.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-138"><a id="_idTextAnchor138"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.407.1">Flexing with responsive design</span></h2>

<p><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.414.1">Responsive design</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.415.1"> is an approach to website design that has the goal of creating sites that provide an optimal viewing experience, meaning it is easy to read and navigate with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrolling, across a wide range of devices, from large desktop computer monitors to smaller mobile phones. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.415.2">While there are some specific technological components, it’s largely more about a basic approach, a mindset even. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.415.3">It’s based on the knowledge that a large percentage of the world’s population uses smaller mobile devices to access the internet these days rather than desktop computers with, typically, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.416.1">large monitors.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.1">Key aspects of responsive design</span><a id="_idIndexMarker490"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.1"> include </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.419.1">the following:</span></span></p>

<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.420.1">Fluid grids</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.421.1">: The layout of a website can use</span><a id="_idIndexMarker491"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.1"> a CSS construct called flexible grids. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.2">They adapt to the viewer’s screen size automatically, reflowing content or even rearranging it as needed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.3">This also means that instead of designing fixed-width layouts, elements on the page are sized in relative units such as percentages, rather than absolute units such </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.423.1">as pixels.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.424.1">Flexible images</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.425.1">: Images in responsive design are also fluid. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.425.2">They are sized in relative units to prevent them from displaying outside their containing element. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.425.3">This ensures that images don’t suddenly take up a large chunk of the screen real estate, pushing more important content out of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.426.1">the way.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.427.1">Media queries</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.428.1">: CSS media queries allow the page to use different CSS style rules based on the characteristics of the device, most commonly the width of the browser. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.428.2">I’ll give an example of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.429.1">this shortly.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.430.1">Mobile first</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.431.1">: The concept here is that you should design for small screens first and then add more features and content for larger screens as necessary. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.431.2">It ensures accessibility for mobile users from </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.432.1">the start.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.433.1">Breakpoints</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.434.1">: In responsive design, breakpoints are used to define where the website’s layout should change to accommodate different screen sizes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.434.2">Common breakpoints are set for mobile, tablet, and desktop widths. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.434.3">Breakpoints and media queries typically work together in that breakpoints typically are implemented, in part, using </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.435.1">media queries.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.436.1">Typography and readability</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.1">: Text size and line spacing are important in responsive design too. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.2">They need to be adjusted appropriately to ensure readability across different devices. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.3">Responsive typography may use relative units such as </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.438.1">em</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.439.1"> or </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.440.1">rem</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.1"> for text sizing, which are alternate units available in CSS (as opposed to </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.442.1">px</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.443.1"> and </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.444.1">pt</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.445.1">, for example – there are </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.446.1">a lot</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.447.1"> of units available in CSS for more advanced </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.448.1">use cases).</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.449.1">Touch versus mouse</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.450.1">: Developers should</span><a id="_idIndexMarker492"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.451.1"> be aware that some users will be using devices where touch is the primary method of interaction – a smartphone, for example – versus desktops that are more often used with mice. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.451.2">Touch interactions have different needs than those with a mouse. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.451.3">As one common example, buttons tend to need to be larger for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.1">touch interactions.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.453.1">Performance optimization</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.454.1">: Responsive sites often need to load on various devices with different capabilities and connection speeds. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.454.2">While many users will have modern, high-powered smartphones, that isn’t always the case. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.454.3">Some may have underpowered devices that are simply slower. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.454.4">Therefore, optimizing images, minifying CSS and JS (reducing their size through various tools), and leveraging techniques such as lazy loading, where images and other content aren’t even loaded until the user scrolls far enough down the page for them to be visible, can help improve performance for all users, but especially those using </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.455.1">weaker devices.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.456.1">Testing</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.457.1">: Responsive designs must be tested on multiple devices and browsers to ensure compatibility and usability. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.457.2">This can involve physical device testing, emulators, and online sites</span><a id="_idIndexMarker493"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.458.1"> that can simulate a website across many different devices and configurations </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.459.1">at once.</span></span></li>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.1">Responsive design is essential in a web environment where users expect a seamless experience whether they’re on a phone, tablet, laptop, or desktop. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.2">For a web developer, understanding the principles of responsive design is crucial for creating web applications that are accessible and user-friendly across </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.461.1">all devices.</span></span></p>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-140"><a id="_idTextAnchor140"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.638.1">PWAs</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.639.1">All the ideas discussed</span><a id="_idIndexMarker509"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.640.1"> so far lead to one</span><a id="_idIndexMarker510"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.641.1"> final frontend </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.642.1">topic: </span></span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.643.1">PWAs</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.644.1">.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.645.1">PWAs are a way to write more advanced websites – web applications, really – by using common web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JS (which may or may not use various libraries, which you’ll explore in the next chapter). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.645.2">They are intended to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant web browser. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.645.3">PWAs</span><a id="_idIndexMarker511"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.646.1"> have several defining features </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.647.1">and benefits:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.648.1">Responsive</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.649.1">: PWAs should fit any form factor, be it desktop, mobile, tablet, or device that hasn’t even been developed yet or is in the early days (virtual </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.650.1">reality, anyone?)</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.651.1">Progressive enhancement</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.652.1">: The core functionality of the app should work for every user no matter what their browser and OS capabilities are, but then progressive enhancement is used to provide a better experience for users with more </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.653.1">capable platforms.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.654.1">Connectivity independent</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.655.1">: Using a special bit of JS code called a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.656.1">service worker</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.657.1">, PWAs can work even when the user</span><a id="_idIndexMarker512"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.658.1"> is offline. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.658.2">This is accomplished by storing resources (HTML, CSS, JS, images, and more) on the client</span><a id="_idIndexMarker513"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.659.1"> and using those stored – known as </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.660.1">cached</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.661.1"> – versions when the user can’t connect to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.662.1">the network.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.663.1">An app-like feel</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.664.1">: PWAs often feel more like desktop apps (native apps, we call them) rather than websites. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.664.2">This comes about due to things such as alerts appearing like others generated by the OS, the ability to use hardware devices that generally aren’t usable on a website, and more complex interactions (multiple windows, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.665.1">for example).</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.666.1">Fresh</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.667.1">: While service workers allow for offline access, they also provide a mechanism by which to update those cached resources when online. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.667.2">This ensures the PWA has the latest code and therefore appears </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.668.1">fresh</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.669.1"> to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.670.1">the user.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.671.1">Safe</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.672.1">: PWAs can only be served via HTTPS connections. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.672.2">This prevents snooping and ensures content hasn’t been </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.673.1">tampered with.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.674.1">Discoverable</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.675.1">: Thanks to some special configuration files you must provide when building a PWA, they are identified as an application, not merely a website, to the browser and the OS. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.675.2">This is what allows them to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.676.1">be installed.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.677.1">Installable</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.678.1">: Users can add apps to their home </span><a id="_idIndexMarker514"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.679.1">screen on their</span><a id="_idIndexMarker515"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.680.1"> phone, or their desktop/start menu</span><a id="_idIndexMarker516"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.681.1"> on a PC or Mac, without the hassle of going through an app store. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.681.2">Simply going to a URL like any other website, as long as the website provides a few necessary pieces (service worker and a configuration file called a manifest file, mainly), is enough for the browser and OS to treat it as an installable app, much like any other app you </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.682.1">might install.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.683.1">Linkable</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.684.1">: Since a PWA is fundamentally still a website – just one with more capabilities – it means it is easily shared via a URL and does not require complex installation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.684.2">Typically, visiting a website that is set up to be a PWA will trigger a request asking if you want to install it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.684.3">After that, it appears like any other installed app on your phone </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.685.1">or computer.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.686.1">For a software developer, building a PWA involves creating a responsive web application that includes a manifest file and a service worker – the manifest file provides information about the application (such as name, author, icon, and description) to the browser, and the service worker enables features such as push notifications, background data sync, and offline functionality via caching and updating of resources. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.686.2">PWAs bridge the gap between web applications and native applications, offering the UX and capabilities of native apps with the reach and accessibility of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.687.1">the web.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.688.1">Building a PWA isn’t fundamentally complex, but it does involve a few steps that can be tricky, especially when dealing with the need to work over HTTPS only. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.688.2">Because of this, I’m not going to demonstrate building one here as it’s definitely a more advanced topic. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.688.3">While PWAs are fairly popular these days, they aren’t universally supported, nor are they something you definitely need to know. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.688.4">In fact, you may never need to build one at all. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.688.5">If you do, though, this section should have laid the groundwork for understanding the basics, and you can explore it at a later time, when and if you </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.689.1">need to.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.690.1">So, yes – ensuring your website looks good and follows good UX practices so that it is functional for your users is very important. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.690.2">Implementing responsive design is often a part of that, and using progressive concepts can also result in a more efficient experience for your users. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.690.3">PWAs are another potential level </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.691.1">after that.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.692.1">But none of that would much matter</span><a id="_idIndexMarker517"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.693.1"> if you don’t put your website</span><a id="_idIndexMarker518"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.694.1"> somewhere that can be accessed by those users. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.694.2">While that can be as easy as dropping your code onto a physical server, in this day and age, that’s not necessarily the best answer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.694.3">Plus, best or not, it’s for sure not the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.695.1">only</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.696.1"> answer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.696.2">Along these lines, another concept that plays into deploying a website is virtualization, by way of VMs and containers, and that’s the next topic up </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.697.1">for discussion!</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-141"><a id="_idTextAnchor141"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.698.1">Virtualizing the world – VMs and containers</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.699.1">In the last chapter, you played </span><a id="_idIndexMarker519"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.700.1">around with Linux</span><a id="_idIndexMarker520"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.701.1"> a bit via some online Linux playgrounds (you </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.702.1">did</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.703.1"> do that, right?). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.703.2">Did you stop for a second and wonder how those sites pulled that off? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.703.3">You were essentially logging in to a machine running Linux, but surely there couldn’t be a physical server for every user who might be doing the same thing at the same time, could there? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.703.4">In all likelihood, the answer is no. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.703.5">Instead, they most probably used either a VM or a container to pull off </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.704.1">that magic.</span></span></p>
<p><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.705.1">VMs and containers</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.706.1"> are two different but related technologies used to create efficient, isolated environments for running applications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.706.2">They both have the same basic goal, which is to virtualize </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.707.1">an environment.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.708.1">But what does </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.709.1">virtualize</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.710.1"> mean? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.710.2">To explain that, you have to think about how a computer </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.711.1">normally works.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.712.1">Normally, you have some hardware – obviously, things such as motherboards, CPUs, memory, various buses for components to communicate over, and so on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.712.2">This is all physical stuff – electronics and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.713.1">all that.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.714.1">Then, on top of the hardware, you have an operating system or OS. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.714.2">It might be Windows, or maybe Linux, or perhaps macOS, and so on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.714.3">Sharp-eyed readers may realize</span><a id="_idIndexMarker521"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.715.1"> there is also something called </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.716.1">firmware</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.717.1">, which is software that is permanently embedded in the hardware. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.717.2">You can kind of think of that as part of the hardware, though, since that’s where it lives. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.717.3">For the most part, it’s the hardware plus the software in the form of an OS, and of course, then all the applications that run on top of that, which is </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.718.1">more software.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.719.1">So now, </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.720.1">virtualizing</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.721.1"> in essence means to take all of that – the hardware, software/firmware, all of it – and simulate it in a computer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.721.2">Through some very clever coding, it is possible to simulate a computer, all the way down to the hardware, in software. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.721.3">How that works is </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.722.1">way</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.723.1"> beyond the scope of this book, but fortunately, it doesn’t really matter either! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.723.2">We can simply be happy that such </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.724.1">magic exists.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.725.1">The benefit to this, probably the biggest one anyway, is this virtualized computer – which is completely separate from</span><a id="_idIndexMarker522"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.726.1"> the computer it’s running on (typically called the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.727.1">host</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.728.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.728.2">If you create a file on the host, usually, it won’t be accessible from a virtualized computer running on it and vice versa. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.728.3">If you install some piece of software on a virtualized computer, it has no impact on the host. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.728.4">It’s literally as if you have two different computers; they are isolated from </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.729.1">one another.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.730.1">There is more than one way</span><a id="_idIndexMarker523"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.731.1"> to virtualize a computer</span><a id="_idIndexMarker524"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.732.1"> such as this, and two of the most common are VMs and containers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.732.2">These strive to achieve the same basic goal – simulating a computer inside of another – but they differ significantly in their approach and architecture. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.732.3">Let’s talk about both now, see how they compare and how they differ, and why we might choose one </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.733.1">over another.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-142"><a id="_idTextAnchor142"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.734.1">Understanding VMs</span></h2>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.753.1">VMs are very compatible and as such can run almost any OS you like. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.753.2">In fact, you can even run older OSs that wouldn’t work on your physical machine anymore, which provides a solution for running legacy applications, or applications requiring specific OS environments that you wouldn’t normally want to run on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.754.1">your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.755.1">Each VM has its own set of virtual hardware (CPUs, memory, disks, and so on), including storage devices, which are in effect carved out from your physical storage. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.755.2">This leads to potentially higher storage requirements on your host. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.755.3">For example, if you have a 500 GB hard drive in your computer and you want to create a Linux VM with a 100 GB hard drive, this means you lose 100 GB of your physical hard drive to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.756.1">the VM.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.757.1">VMs require more management overhead due to the need to support separate OSs and virtual hardware configurations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.757.2">Remember – you in effect have more than one computer to deal with now! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.757.3">When you first create a VM, it is “naked,” meaning that it’s just like having a physical computer with nothing on it yet. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.757.4">You will then have to install the OS yourself (which means you’ll need a proper license for it). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.757.5">Later, when updates need to be done, you’ll need to do that yourself, on top of any you might have to do on your host machine. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.757.6">It’s just more management you need to do, just like having two </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.758.1">physical machines.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.759.1">VMs nowadays provide excellent performance, which is a bit surprising given they are simulating a full computer, often down to the hardware level. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.759.2">There are a lot of tricks played to make this happen, things such as effective sharing of the physical hardware. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.759.3">But however it’s done, on a sufficiently powerful host machine, you should notice only small performance differences in the guest. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.759.4">In fact, if you maximize the window a VM is running in, you should</span><a id="_idIndexMarker528"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.760.1"> find that it’s fairly tough to tell it isn’t the physical machine at </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.761.1">that point.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.820.1">As I mentioned earlier, though, VMs are just one way to skin the virtualization cat. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.820.2">Another extremely popular way is containers, so let’s look at </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.821.1">them now.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-144"><a id="_idTextAnchor144"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.822.1">Understanding containers</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.823.1">Containers differ from VMs</span><a id="_idIndexMarker533"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.824.1"> in that they are not simulations of whole computers, though you can be fooled into thinking they are. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.824.2">In many cases, you can log in to a container and do everything inside of it that you could in a VM or a physical machine. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.824.3">They pull this off by isolating what’s inside the container and what’s outside on the host at a low level in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.825.1">host OS.</span></span></p>
<p><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.826.1">Containers</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.827.1"> are primarily a Linux facility as they depend on certain low-level capabilities in the Linux kernel (the core code that the entire Linux OS is built on top of). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.827.2">You can run containers on Windows too, but the way it’s done there is actually by using a Linux VM in a way transparent </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.828.1">to you!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.829.1">But, regardless, the basic architecture of a container is that containers package together an application and its dependencies (things such as libraries, binaries, and so on) but share the OS kernel of the host system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.829.2">Whereas the kernel is simulated inside a VM, a container uses the actual kernel that the host OS </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.830.1">is in.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.831.1">Just as with VMs, containers</span><a id="_idIndexMarker534"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.832.1"> are isolated from the host OS, despite the fact that they share the kernel and other system resources. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.832.2">The OS itself takes care of that isolation automatically, so from our user perspective, it looks like a VM, which of course looks like a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.833.1">physical machine.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.834.1">Containers have a couple</span><a id="_idIndexMarker535"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.835.1"> of benefits </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.836.1">over VMs:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.837.1">First, because they aren’t simulating a full machine, they are noticeably faster. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.837.2">This is especially apparent during startup. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.837.3">Whereas a VM has to go through a full OS boot cycle just like a real computer, a container does not, and so they tend to start pretty much instantly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.837.4">They also use considerably fewer host resources since, again, they aren’t simulating a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.838.1">whole computer.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.839.1">Second, containers provide a more consistent environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.839.2">Think about earlier chapters where we talked about being able to give a developer a </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.840.1">package.json</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.841.1"> file, which they can then run </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.842.1">npm install</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.843.1"> with and get all the dependencies your application needs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.843.2">That is indeed handy, but what happens if they have a different version of Node installed than you do? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.843.3">And what if that version happens to have a bug that yours doesn’t? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.843.4">That developer may find that your project doesn’t work on their machine but does on yours. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.843.5">Containers solve this by bundling up not only your code and its dependencies but even things such as Node. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.843.6">If you give that developer a container instead, you can ensure their environment matches yours, so you know your code </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.844.1">will work.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.845.1">Containers are a general term for what is a function of the operating system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.845.2">But you won’t usually be interacting with this function directly because it is, to put it mildly, not a pleasant experience. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.845.3">Instead, you’ll almost certainly use some sort of software that is a wrapper around that function. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.845.4">The most popular</span><a id="_idIndexMarker536"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.846.1"> such wrapper today by far is called Docker. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.846.2">In fact, it’s so popular that people will usually call them </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.847.1">Docker containers</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.848.1"> rather than just containers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.848.2">Let’s talk about containers under Docker a bit now and see them </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.849.1">in action!</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-145"><a id="_idTextAnchor145"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.850.1">Using containers</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.851.1">To play with containers, we’re actually</span><a id="_idIndexMarker537"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.852.1"> going to use your brand-new Ubuntu VM! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.852.2">You see, since containers require Linux, and since I don’t know what OS you’re using normally, I can at least be sure you have Ubuntu running in VirtualBox at this point, so I know you have a Linux machine available, albeit a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.853.1">virtual one!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.854.1">The first thing you’ll need to do, inside your VM, is launch the Terminal application. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.854.2">This gets you to a command prompt. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.854.3">Next, you’ll need to install Docker with </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.855.1">this command:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.888.1">How can you tell what </span><a id="_idIndexMarker541"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.889.1">images and containers there are available</span><a id="_idIndexMarker542"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.890.1"> on your system? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.890.2">Well,  </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.891.1">that’s easy:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.906.1">However, the container still exists in a sense, and you can see it by adding an option to the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.907.1">previous command:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1015.1">Now that you have some idea what VMs and containers are all about, let’s look at the key differences between them and the questions to ask yourself when deciding which is appropriate </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1016.1">to use.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-147"><a id="_idTextAnchor147"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1017.1">Key differences between VMs and containers and choosing between them</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1018.1">There are several</span><a id="_idIndexMarker562"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1019.1"> differences</span><a id="_idIndexMarker563"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1020.1"> between VMs and containers that will often factor into deciding which </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1021.1">to use:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1022.1">Performance</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1023.1">: Containers are generally faster and more resource-efficient than VMs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1023.2">This is definitely true when thinking about how fast they start up, but it’s also true when they are running. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1023.3">Remember – a VM is simulating an entire computer while containers aren’t, and that simulation costs processor time and memory utilization on the host machine, all of which can impact the performance of the VM </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1024.1">and</span></em> <span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1025.1">the host.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1026.1">Overhead</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1027.1">: In a sense, this is another aspect of performance, but it’s different enough to call out. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1027.2">VMs have more overhead in terms of CPU, memory, storage, and other system resources, due to the need for a full OS in each instance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1027.3">Containers are sharing the resources of the host more directly, so while they certainly do have some degree of overhead, it tends to be a lot lower </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1028.1">than VMs.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1029.1">Portability</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1030.1">: Containers are highly portable across different machines, as long as they run the same OS kernel. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1030.2">In other words, the files inside a container have to work with the kernel in the host machine, and as long as they do, then a container can run on any machine. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1030.3">With a VM, this isn’t the case, which means they are even </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1031.1">more</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1032.1"> portable than containers since you can run a Windows VM on a Linux host, a macOS VM on a Windows host, or any other combination </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1033.1">you want.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1034.1">Security</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1035.1">: VMs offer more</span><a id="_idIndexMarker564"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1036.1"> isolation, which can be beneficial</span><a id="_idIndexMarker565"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1037.1"> for security, while containers offer enough isolation for most purposes but require careful management to ensure security. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1037.2">The complete isolation of VMs can provide a more secure environment, as one VM’s compromise doesn’t directly threaten others. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1037.3">Given that containers share the host OS’s kernel, it should be obvious that there is at least some possibility of security issues, and vulnerabilities in the kernel itself can potentially affect all containers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1037.4">However, in practice, as long as you have an up-to-date host machine, and as long as your containers are configured properly, they are quite safe from a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1038.1">security standpoint.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1039.1">Management and orchestration</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1040.1">: VMs are often managed with pretty advanced management tools such as VMware vCenter or Microsoft System Center, which provide for centralized management of many VMs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1040.2">Containers tend to be managed more often from a command prompt, though there definitely are graphical management tools as well. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1040.3">VM management tools allow for easy deployment, control, and scaling of VMs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1040.4">Scaling means that if a VM needs more resources, it can be expanded, often on the fly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1040.5">With containers, the answer more often than not is simply to create more instances of a given container and balance work between them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1040.6">This is called orchestration, and it’s where more advanced </span><a id="_idIndexMarker566"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1041.1">things such as Kubernetes come into play. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1041.2">This is a Google product that allows for more flexible control of containers – things such as grouping them more efficiently to handle load. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1041.3">It’s a very powerful tool, but it’s also quite a bit more complex than the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1042.1">containers themselves.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1043.1">Rapid deployment and scaling</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1044.1">: I mentioned this in the previous bullet, but it’s an important point: because containers tend to start very fast and are more lightweight, containers can be started, stopped, and replicated quickly and easily, making them ideal for dynamic, scalable environments. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1044.2">VMs, by contrast, take longer to start and use more host resources. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1044.3">That means that for a given server, you can almost certainly run more containers than you can VMs, so if you start getting a lot of new users on your shiny new website, you can create more containers to handle traffic faster and easier and with fewer host requirements than </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1045.1">with VMs.</span></span></li>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1046.1">In summary, while there is certainly</span><a id="_idIndexMarker567"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1047.1"> an overlap between VMs and</span><a id="_idIndexMarker568"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1048.1"> containers, each has its unique strengths and weaknesses. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1048.2">VMs provide complete isolation with a full OS environment, making them suitable for applications that need a full OS or different OS types. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1048.3">But that makes them more heavyweight in terms of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1049.1">resource requirements.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1050.1">Containers, being lighter and more efficient since they are not a complete running OS, are ideal for applications where portability and quick scaling are important. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1050.2">I would go so far as to say that today, it’s usually safer to start from the assumption that you’ll use containers more often than a VM for deploying an app or website (if you’re not going to simply run your code</span><a id="_idIndexMarker569"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1051.1"> on a server, that is, which we tend to call </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1052.1">bare metal</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1053.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1053.2">Especially in cases where you expect that your load requirements (how many users are using your website) might increase rapidly, containers are usually the better option (VMs can scale as well, but it’s a less efficient process). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1053.3">On the other hand, if absolute security is your main concern, and/or complete isolation from anything else that might be running on the same physical machine, then a VM is a very </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1054.1">good option.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1058.1">Some people like to be trite</span><a id="_idIndexMarker570"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1059.1"> and say that the cloud just means running your code on someone else’s computer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1059.2">And, I mean, it’s not </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1060.1">untrue</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1061.1">! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1061.2">But there’s much more to it </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1062.1">than that.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1063.1">The </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1064.1">cloud</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1065.1"> refers to cloud computing, which</span><a id="_idIndexMarker571"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1066.1"> is the delivery of various services over the internet, including data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software (read: your websites and applications). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1066.2">Cloud computing allows for flexible resources (meaning you can get just what you need when you need it), faster innovation (since you don’t need to build and configure servers and services yourself), and economies of scale (since the costs of building the infrastructure behind the cloud are amortized across all the people using it). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1066.3">You typically pay only for the cloud services you use, helping lower operating costs, run infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1067.1">needs change.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1068.1">Let’s say you </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1069.1">don’t</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1070.1"> want to use the cloud. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1070.2">What that may mean is that you have to buy your own hardware, set it up, and configure the operating system and all the services on top of it (databases, mail services, user authentication services, web servers, and so on). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1070.3">Then, you have to put your code on it and run it, ensuring that the whole thing is secure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1070.4">Then, if your website becomes super-popular and you start getting more traffic, you may then have to add hardware to expand the capacity or reconfigure the services to handle the added load. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1070.5">Eventually, you may have to add whole servers and configure networking in such a way that the load is balanced </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1071.1">across them.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1072.1">With the cloud, these sorts</span><a id="_idIndexMarker572"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1073.1"> of concerns are automatic, or at least can be changed just by updating some settings on a control panel website offered by the cloud provider. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1073.2">You change some settings, click a button, and suddenly you have more memory, more bandwidth, and more CPU available to handle the expanded load. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1073.3">It’s a much easier thing to do. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1073.4">And the cost savings are significant: when you build your own server, you have to guess at the load, and it’s usually smart to over-purchase. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1073.5">If you think a server with a single 3 GHz CPU will be enough, you may want to buy a dual-processor machine up-front to have some headroom to grow. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1073.6">But, if you don’t grow, now you’ve effectively wasted money. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1073.7">With the cloud, you can add that second CPU when you see that you need it, so you’re not paying for one you don’t need or may not need for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1074.1">a while.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1076.1">There are many different</span><a id="_idIndexMarker573"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1077.1"> cloud providers</span><a id="_idIndexMarker574"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1078.1"> these days, but the biggest are </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1079.1">Amazon Web Services</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1080.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1081.1">AWS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1082.1">), </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1083.1">Microsoft Azure</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1084.1">, and </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1085.1">Google Cloud Platform</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1086.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1087.1">GCP</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1088.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1088.2">Oracle also has a fairly popular cloud offering, as</span><a id="_idIndexMarker575"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1089.1"> does IBM and some other smaller players, but Amazon, Microsoft, and Google are definitely the big boys. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1089.2">Ultimately, though, they all have the same basic proposition: run your code on their infrastructure, using only what </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1090.1">you need.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1091.1">It may be surprising to hear that the company that most people associate with the internet – Google – has a cloud offering that, it’s fair to say, isn’t quite as popular as AWS and Azure, which are the two most popular cloud providers as of this writing, almost without question. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1091.2">In fact, when someone talks about “the cloud” these days, they almost certainly mean one of those two providers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1091.3">That’s how much larger they are than the rest in terms of usage </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1092.1">and mindshare.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1093.1">Regardless, though, all cloud</span><a id="_idIndexMarker576"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1094.1"> providers offer a ton of different services, with a high degree of stability. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1094.2">Of course, that doesn’t come for free: using a public cloud can get rather expensive if you aren’t careful. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1094.3">It’s not at all difficult to find horror stories online of people waking up to huge AWS bills because their website got super-popular overnight. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1094.4">You definitely need to exercise caution when using them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1094.5">Fortunately, all good cloud providers offer ways to control your spending. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1094.6">With AWS, for example, you can configure spending limits on your account so that you don’t get hit with a life-altering bill out of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1095.1">the blue.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1096.1">It’s more than that, though: you have to think about whether the cloud is the right answer for a given use case at all. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1096.2">Sometimes, it more clearly is: when you know your load requirements will be highly variable, for example. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1096.3">Being able to use just the capacity you need is very appealing in such cases. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1096.4">Obviously, the complexity of setting up the various services cloud providers offer yourself can be overwhelming and very expensive in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1097.1">such cases.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1098.1">But sometimes, having your own hardware is cheaper and simpler too, especially if you have a good idea of what your load will be over time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1098.2">And if what you’re building doesn’t require most of what the cloud provides, then it might make more sense to do </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1099.1">it yourself.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1100.1">It’s not simple calculus and many, many factors go into such a decision, many of which are very project-dependent. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1100.2">I’m not trying to supply a checklist to use for such a decision here because that would be a nigh-impossible task. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1100.3">Instead, I’m just trying to make the point that the decision to go to the cloud or not is one you’ll need to make with every project based on its unique requirements. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1100.4">There are certainly benefits to the cloud, but there are </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1101.1">negatives too.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1102.1">Complicating matters more is that the cloud</span><a id="_idIndexMarker577"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1103.1"> isn’t a single thing, regardless of whose cloud it is. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1103.2">There are effectively three types of clouds to be familiar with. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1103.3">Let’s talk about </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1104.1">them now.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-150"><a id="_idTextAnchor150"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1105.1">Understanding cloud types</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1106.1">The cloud can be public, private, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1107.1">or hybrid:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1108.1">Public cloud</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1109.1">: These are cloud services </span><a id="_idIndexMarker578"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1110.1">offered over the public</span><a id="_idIndexMarker579"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1111.1"> internet, available to anyone willing to pay. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1111.2">The public cloud is generally services such as AWS, Azure, and GCP. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1111.3">They run in data centers provided by, maintained by, and completely controlled by </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1112.1">the providers.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1113.1">Private cloud</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1114.1">: This is server infrastructure</span><a id="_idIndexMarker580"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1115.1"> used exclusively </span><a id="_idIndexMarker581"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1116.1">by a single business or organization, making it available only to their internal development teams. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1116.2">This is typically done by larger companies who want or need a higher level of control over how things are done, especially in areas such as banking where regulations dictate a tighter level of control over </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1117.1">sensitive data.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1118.1">Hybrid cloud</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1119.1">: Combines public and private</span><a id="_idIndexMarker582"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1120.1"> clouds, bound together</span><a id="_idIndexMarker583"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1121.1"> by technology allowing data and applications to be shared. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1121.2">Imagine running your website on your private cloud, but then having it connect to a database service in a public cloud in order to save some money (database software tends to be quite expensive at </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1122.1">larger scales).</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1123.1">And besides those three types, cloud services can break down into several key services too. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1123.2">Let’s look at just some of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1124.1">them now.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1126.1">Cloud offerings come</span><a id="_idIndexMarker584"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1127.1"> in many flavors, but they tend to come with names that end in “</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1128.1">aaS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1129.1">,” which is short for “</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1130.1">as a Service</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1131.1">.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1131.2">When you build a server yourself, and you need a database to run on it, you will need to install the database software and configure it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1131.3">By contrast, </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1132.1">DataBase as a Service</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1133.1">, or </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1134.1">DBaaS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1135.1">, is when a cloud provider</span><a id="_idIndexMarker585"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1136.1"> offers preconfigured database services to you. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1136.2">You’ll still need to do some degree of configuration, of course, for your needs, but the basic database software is something you won’t have to worry about. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1136.3">From your perspective, it’s just a service you use, just like cable TV (uhh, does anyone actually still have </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1137.1">cable TV?!)</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1138.1">Some of the other “aaS” offerings</span><a id="_idIndexMarker586"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1139.1"> you may meet – but definitely not all of them since there seems to be a new one every week – include </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1140.1">the following:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1141.1">Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1142.1">: This is an offering of fundamental</span><a id="_idIndexMarker587"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1143.1"> computing resources such as VMs, networking, and storage. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1143.2">An example of this is AWS </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1144.1">Elastic Compute Cloud</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1145.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1146.1">EC2</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1147.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1147.2">This can largely be thought of as someone setting</span><a id="_idIndexMarker588"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1148.1"> up a server for you, which you can then do what you </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1149.1">want with.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1150.1">Platform as a Service (PaaS)</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1151.1">: This provides hardware</span><a id="_idIndexMarker589"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1152.1"> and software tools over the internet. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1152.2">It is conceptually a level above IaaS in that it normally will include things such as an operating system and software installed on top </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1153.1">of that.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1154.1">Software as a Service (SaaS)</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1155.1">: This service delivers software</span><a id="_idIndexMarker590"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1156.1"> applications over the internet, on a subscription basis. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1156.2">One example is Microsoft Office 365, where you can use all of Microsoft’s Office applications over </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1157.1">the internet.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1158.1">Containers as a Service (CaaS)</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1159.1">: This provides a runtime</span><a id="_idIndexMarker591"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1160.1"> environment for containers of any type you wish </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1161.1">to run.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1162.1">Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS)</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1163.1">: This is a service that you can use to back up your</span><a id="_idIndexMarker592"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1164.1"> important data and restore it </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1165.1">as necessary.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1166.1">As I said, there are a myriad of other “aaS” offerings, and each cloud provider will have different options available. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1166.2">To complicate matters, the various providers won’t even always agree on the terminology! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1166.3">For example, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1167.1">CaaS</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1168.1"> may not mean </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1169.1">Container as a Service</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1170.1"> in one cloud provider versus another. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1170.2">That said, the ones in this list tend to be fairly consistent and are probably the ones you’ll see </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1171.1">most often.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1172.1">Names aside, when you use the cloud, you may use just one service, or you may use many. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1172.2">AWS, for example, has upward of 200 services available as of this writing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1172.3">But that’s another advantage of the cloud: you can mix and match services however you need, adding and subtracting as you go. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1172.4">It’s the Burger King model: have it </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1173.1">your way!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1174.1">Cloud computing’s flexibility, combined with its capacity for innovation, makes it a cornerstone of modern IT infrastructure, essential for businesses to remain competitive and agile in a rapidly evolving</span><a id="_idIndexMarker593"/> <span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1175.1">digital landscape.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1176.1">But you may not need the cloud at all. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1176.2">Well, sort of. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1176.3">Let’s talk about something </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1177.1">called serverless.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-152"><a id="_idTextAnchor152"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1178.1">Who even needs the cloud or even servers? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1178.2">– Serverless</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1179.1">A fairly recent development</span><a id="_idIndexMarker594"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1180.1"> in software development is something called </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1181.1">serverless</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1182.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1182.2">This is still really a cloud offering, but it’s a fair bit different than the usual cloud. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1182.3">Generally speaking, with any cloud offering, you have some software running all the time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1182.4">If no one uses it, it’s still running, albeit at a very low level because clouds can scale operations down at such times to save resources and ultimately save </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1183.1">you money.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1184.1">But, for some applications, you don’t even </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1185.1">need that!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1186.1">Imagine for a second that you want to write an application that can solve mathematical equations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1186.2">Based on what you’ve learned so far, you can imagine creating a web page where you can enter a math equation and submit it to some server-side code to solve the equation and return the result. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1186.3">You can further imagine writing some Node code to do that work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1186.4">And given what you’ve learned so far, you even have some idea what that might look like in terms of code, at least at a high level. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1186.5">Ultimately, you’re going to have a JS function that your Node server calls to solve </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1187.1">the equation.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1188.1">But what if I told you that there was a way to have just that function in the cloud and make it callable as if it were a server? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1188.2">Well, that’s exactly what </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1189.1">serverless is!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1190.1">Conceptually, you can think of serverless as a way to start that Node server only when a request comes in, let it call that function, return a result, and then immediately shut down. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1190.2">But that all happens so fast that you can’t even tell – it looks to you like the server is </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1191.1">always running.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1192.1">But, better still, while the code isn’t very complex, as you’ve seen, wouldn’t it be better if you didn’t even have to write the server code? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1192.2">Wouldn’t it be better if you only had to write the function that solves </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1193.1">the equations?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1194.1">That’s serverless in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1195.1">a nutshell!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1196.1">AWS Lambda is one such serverless service. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1196.2">With it, you can write functions, not just in JS but in a whole host of languages. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1196.3">These functions are then callable as if they were running on a server. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1196.4">Lambda takes care of all the plumbing, so to speak – all the code you would need to write yourself to make a server. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1196.5">You just focus on the logic needed and let Lambda take care of the rest. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1196.6">And, best of all, since there isn’t code running all the time awaiting requests, you aren’t paying anything if your functions aren’t being called. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1196.7">You’ll just pay when they’re called, based on how many resources they use. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1196.8">So, if you write fast, efficient code, it’ll cost you less to run </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1197.1">them serverless.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1198.1">Of course, serverless isn’t a suitable model for all applications. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1198.2">But, for the ones where it makes sense, it can make </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1199.1">a lot</span></em> <span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1200.1">of sense.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1201.1">The cloud is an expansive topic and one you may or may not wind up needing to get deeper into, depending on your needs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1201.2">But the last topic I want to touch on plays into almost everything we’ve discussed so far because whether you build your own server or use a cloud provider, you’re obviously going to need to do things such as build your code into a runnable form</span><a id="_idIndexMarker595"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1202.1"> and deploy it, and all of that, and more, is the domain </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1203.1">of DevOps.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1213.1">In the early days, developers did it all. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1213.2">We wrote the code, and then we were the ones who deployed it, meaning installed it onto the server it ran on (whether they were servers we built, servers provided by outside vendors, or the cloud). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1213.3">This was just part of the development process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1213.4">We then worried about things such as monitoring a website for issues and dealing with </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1214.1">those issues.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1215.1">After a while, though, a lot of organizations started taking a different approach by separating out some of those duties and assigning them to groups</span><a id="_idIndexMarker598"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1216.1"> other than developers, typically called the operations team. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1216.2">At that point, developers still wrote the code, but when it came time to deploy it, another group would do that. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1216.3">Things such as monitoring might be handled by an entirely different group, and dealing with issues that came up at least started with a specific support group (though developers still frequently had to get </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1217.1">involved ultimately).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1218.1">Now, the pendulum is starting to swing the other way again in that developers commonly have a hand in deployments and support and all the other concerns that go into running a live website, so we’re repeating ourselves again, though with a few differences. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1218.2">The “new clothes” this time around is something </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1219.1">called DevOps.</span></span></p>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-154"><a id="_idTextAnchor154"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1232.1">Understanding the key aspects of DevOps</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1233.1">There are several key points</span><a id="_idIndexMarker600"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1234.1"> to DevOps at a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1235.1">high level:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1236.1">Culture shift</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1237.1">: DevOps emphasizes a shift in mindset, encouraging collaboration between development and operations teams. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1237.2">This breaks down silos and fosters a culture where building, testing, and releasing software happens rapidly, frequently, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1238.1">more reliably.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1239.1">Automation</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1240.1">: DevOps relies heavily on automation to speed up software development and deployment processes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1240.2">This includes code deployments, testing, infrastructure provisioning, monitoring, and more. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1240.3">Anything that can be automated and run with little or no human intervention is something DevOps will typically seek </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1241.1">to do.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1242.1">Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1243.1">: These are core practices in DevOps. </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1244.1">CI</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1245.1"> refers to the process</span><a id="_idIndexMarker601"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1246.1"> of automatically integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project. </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1247.1">CD</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1248.1"> is an extension of this, where the software can be released to production at any time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1248.2">The basic idea is that as developers push code to Git, automation will see that new code and will build the software or website and deploy it to a test environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1248.3">Frequently, automated tests are run at that point, and developers are alerted to failures so that they can correct issues. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1248.4">If no issues are found, and if everything is configured for it, the new code can be deployed immediately to a production environment for end users to start </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1249.1">using immediately.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1250.1">Monitoring and feedback</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1251.1">: Continuous monitoring of the application and its performance is crucial, especially with so much being automated and more rapid deployments being done. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1251.2">It helps in identifying issues early and helps improve the product in real time based on user feedback and system-level tests. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1251.3">For example, if new code is deployed and you have monitoring in place that alerts you to errors that begin happening, you can take action possibly even before users become aware that there is </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1252.1">an issue.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1253.1">Tools and technologies</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1254.1">: DevOps in general, and CI/CD in </span><a id="_idIndexMarker602"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1255.1">particular, come with a host of new tools to make it all happen. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1255.2">Names such as Jenkins and GitLab come up, which are platforms for running what are called </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1256.1">pipelines</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1257.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1257.2">A pipeline is really just a fancy</span><a id="_idIndexMarker603"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1258.1"> way of saying some scripts that know how to build, test, and deploy your code automatically. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1258.2">Of course, containers play a large role in all of this. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1258.3">For example, a CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy your code may involve the pipeline automatically creating a container temporarily to do the build-in. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1258.4">Other products such as Ansible or Puppet are also often used. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1258.5">These are tools for managing the configuration of environments, often servers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1258.6">For example, the CI/CD pipeline might execute an Ansible job, which handles ensuring the configuration of your production server meets the needs of your application. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1258.7">Getting into DevOps involves learning about many new tools and technologies beyond those needed to design websites and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1259.1">write code.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1260.1">Microservices architecture</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1261.1">: One way that many DevOps teams follow to make dealing with the code they manage easier is to adopt a microservices architecture. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1261.2">This is a way of building applications and websites that breaks them down into many smaller pieces, each providing a needed service to the larger application. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1261.3">For example, you may create a microservice that validates users during login. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1261.4">You may create another that handles registering new users. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1261.5">Rather than rolling both these services up as part of your website, you instead can deploy them as separate applications that the website then makes use of. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1261.6">This allows you to upgrade the registration service without touching the login validation service. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1261.7">This architecture is a natural fit for the DevOps approach because automating these smaller pieces tends to be easier. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1261.8">The trade-off is that making all the pieces work together can sometimes be challenging, and it does tend to make tracking down problems a bit more difficult. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1261.9">But, the benefits oftentimes outweigh any negatives, including the fact that you can scale up services individually to handle greater needs as they </span><a id="_idIndexMarker604"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1262.1">develop easier than trying to scale up a single large – </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1263.1">monolithic</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1264.1">, as they’re known – application. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1264.2">It can also help teams get features out faster since there is less risk in adding a new service or updating</span><a id="_idIndexMarker605"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1265.1"> a single service without touching the code </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1266.1">of another.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-155"><a id="_idTextAnchor155"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1267.1">Determining the benefits of DevOps (and some negatives)</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1268.1">There are several</span><a id="_idIndexMarker606"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1269.1"> benefits </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1270.1">to DevOps.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1271.1">One is the ability to increase deployment frequency (since it’s all automated and in most cases will simply run faster than a human doing it). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1271.2">Teams that implement CI/CD pipelines will often release changes in days or weeks, while teams that don’t use a DevOps mindset may take weeks or months between releases. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1271.3">There are even some companies that deploy code daily, and that would be nearly impossible to do – assuming they want a stable product – </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1272.1">without DevOps.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1273.1">Faster </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1274.1">time to market</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1275.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1276.1">TTM</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1277.1">) is another key benefit. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1277.2">With </span><a id="_idIndexMarker607"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1278.1">everything automated, teams can focus more on writing code than worrying about how it will ultimately get deployed </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1279.1">and run.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1280.1">DevOps also usually allows for a lower failure rate of new releases, at least when done properly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1280.2">This is primarily because testing is usually built into CI/CD pipelines, and assuming the tests are robust enough, you can be fairly well assured that new code doesn’t break anything, and you can therefore have confidence releasing </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1281.1">it faster.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1282.1">In general, in your role as a web developer, you will likely find that DevOps practices not only streamline the development process but also enhance the overall quality and responsiveness of software maintenance </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1283.1">and deployment.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1284.1">Of course, few things in life are all unicorns and rainbows! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1284.2">Even the best of ideas tend to have some downside, and DevOps is </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1285.1">no different.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1286.1">It can become incredibly frustrating when your carefully developed automation suddenly fails. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1286.2">Maybe it relies on a service to compile code, for example, and maybe that service is down for some reason. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1286.3">All of a sudden, your pipelines fail, and maybe they don’t provide detailed enough error information to immediately see what the problem is. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1286.4">Perhaps the admins upgraded Jenkins, and the new version has a bug that breaks your pipeline in some very difficult-to-troubleshoot way. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1286.5">Or, maybe there are a lot of teams running pipelines at once, and all of a sudden, your pipeline takes 2 hours instead of 5 minutes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1286.6">Maybe it’s simply difficult to write the pipeline script to work exactly the way you need because it has some limitations you discovered the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1287.1">hard way.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1288.1">All of these are things I’ve run into in my work, and that’s just the tip of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1289.1">the iceberg.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1290.1">As I alluded to earlier, the microservices</span><a id="_idIndexMarker608"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1291.1"> architecture has many benefits, but troubleshooting them when something goes wrong is definitely not one of them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1291.2">And matters get much worse when you have services maintained by several different teams. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1291.3">Now, not only do you have the difficulty of figuring out which service is at fault, but now you have to interface with that team and get them to correct the issue, and that isn’t always as smooth a situation as you </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1292.1">might hope.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1293.1">But, at the end of the day, most developers tend to agree that the benefits of DevOps far outweigh </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1294.1">any negatives.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1295.1">Now that you have some insight into DevOps, let’s talk about a technology that is often used in the context of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1296.1">DevOps: Python.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1506.1">In this chapter, we covered several unique areas. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1506.2">First, you looked at some frontend concerns, including graphic design, usability, and responsive design, to get a feel for why they’re important and how they benefit you in your web development journey. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1506.3">We then moved to the server side and talked about VMs and containers a bit to see how they are used to run your code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1506.4">You then got a look at the cloud and learned what that’s about. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1506.5">Finally, we talked about DevOps a bit to understand how this popular approach to development enhances our ability to deliver quality code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1506.6">As part of that discussion, you got a look at Python and played with it a little bit to see what it offers, especially as related </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1507.1">to DevOps.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1508.1">In the next chapter, we’ll jump back onto the frontend and focus on some of the biggest frameworks in use today, seeing how they provide you with a head start in your development and allow you to deliver more robust websites while reducing the effort to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.1509.1">do so.</span></span></p>
