			<p>In 2018, Google Classroom went through a major layout change. The <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> section was added to provide teachers and students with a separate page to view all materials, questions, and assignments. Each type of post has a different set of features that allow teachers to communicate with students in different ways. While the previous chapter discussed announcements and how students can comment on announcements, you may have situations where you want to record who responded to a post and even grade that response. An example of this situation is when you want to have a dialogue like a classroom discussion but through Google Classroom.</p>
			<p>There are several advantages to having discussions through Google Classroom. In a generation of Instagram and Snapchat, many students will feel comfortable communicating through an online tool. Furthermore, students do not have to be in the same location to participate. During my time teaching, there were times when students were absent on critical discussion days and could not be assessed. In addition, students can take time to formulate their responses, rather than being put on the spot during a discussion. Therefore, students tend to feel more secure discussing things online instead of in an in-person class because of its familiarity and a lower chance of failure.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important – online or offline discussions</p>
			<p class="callout">There is a delicate balance between the use of online and in-class discussions. Favoring one form of discussion can reduce the effectiveness of the other. Consider incorporating both types of discussion. Some examples of methods of incorporating both online and in-class discussions include asking a discussion question online and then asking a follow-up question in class the next day or discussing different topics in class and online.</p>
			<p>Another use of question posts is to quickly check student understanding. In Alberta, teachers use formative assessment to gauge whether students comprehend the current concept before moving to the next concept. Since question posts allow students to respond in short sentences or answer multiple-choice questions, a question in Google Classroom can show you whether the majority of your students understand the current lesson.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, you will learn how to create short-answer and multiple-choice questions using a question post in the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> section, and then reply to and grade the student responses.</p>
			<p>We will cover the following topics in this chapter:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Creating a question</li>
				<li>Creating short-answer questions</li>
				<li>Replying to student responses</li>
				<li>Creating multiple-choice questions</li>
				<li>Grading a question<p class="callout-heading">Important</p><p class="callout">Google Classroom calls a student's response to a question post an answer. However, because of the teaching philosophy of the author, this chapter will refer to them as responses.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/>Creating a question</h1>
			<p>With<a id="_idIndexMarker173"/> the different types of posts, many of the features, such as attaching a file, use the same steps as the announcement and material posts. However, posts such as questions and assignments have additional features. If you are reading this book out of chapter order, refer to the previous chapter, <a href="B16846_03_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor040"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Sending Your First Announcement</em>, for the features that are also found in announcements.</p>
			<p>You create questions in the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> section by selecting the <strong class="bold">Question</strong> option under the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> button, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.1_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 4.1 – The Question option in the Classwork section&#13;&#10;" width="393" height="523"/>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.1 – The Question option in the Classwork section</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"/>Additional features in a question post not found in an announcement post</h2>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker174"/> following screenshot shows the dialog box that appears <a id="_idIndexMarker175"/>when creating a question post:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.2_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 4.2 – Main sections of a question post&#13;&#10;" width="1250" height="631"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.2 – Main sections of a question post</p>
			<p>There are three fields where an announcement post only has one. Furthermore, question posts have question options that affect the type of question and how students interact with <a id="_idIndexMarker176"/>each other within the question:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Question</strong> field <a id="_idIndexMarker177"/>is where you write your question. It only allows you to include text without formatting. (If you need to include an image with your question, you can use the attachment features.)</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Instructions</strong> field is where you can write additional steps or expectations of the question. For example, you may want to instruct students that they must also reply to another student's response.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Points</strong> field is where you can change the assessment value of the question. The points are only numeric but can be disabled if not needed.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Due</strong> field allows you to assign by when students must have their responses submitted. This field includes the option to select a specific time and date.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Questions (and assignments) do not require a due date. Within the drop-down menu for <strong class="bold">Due date &amp; time</strong>, click the <strong class="bold">X</strong> beside the date to disable the due date:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.3_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 4.3 – Cancelling the due date of a post&#13;&#10;" width="498" height="199"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.3 – Cancelling the due date of a post</p>
			<p>While not necessary, having due dates on questions and assignments will add the events to the Google Calendar linked to Google Classroom. In <a href="B16846_08_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor110"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Keeping Parents in the Loop</em>, you will learn how to allow parents to view the calendar.</p>
			<p>The question options, found below <strong class="bold">Topic</strong>, depend on the question type – short-answer or multiple-choice. Each subsequent section will explore these options.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>Creating short-answer questions</h1>
			<p>The short-answer <a id="_idIndexMarker178"/>question type is the default question type. Depending on how the question options are set, the short-answer question type can perform two different tasks: student collaboration or teacher assessment. The <strong class="bold">Students can reply to each other</strong> question option allows the teacher to determine whether students can see and reply to the responses of other classmates. By disabling this option, only the teacher (and co-teachers) will be able to see the responses and assess each student's response individually. However, by leaving this option enabled, students can reply to each other's responses, encouraging student collaboration through online discussion.</p>
			<p>The second option for short answers is <strong class="bold">Students can edit answer</strong>. By enabling this option, students will be able to edit their responses after submission. By leaving this option disabled, a warning prompt, shown as follows, will appear before confirming the student's submission:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.4_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 4.4 – Submit confirmation dialog box for students&#13;&#10;" width="537" height="199"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.4 – Submit confirmation dialog box for students</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip – when to allow student edits</p>
			<p class="callout">Generally, it is better to leave this option disabled. Preventing students from altering their submission is not available in assignment posts, discussed in the next chapter. Even when they are unable to edit their submission, students can add private comments to their responses. In online collaboration, a student is able to reply to their own response. Therefore, using private comments and replies leaves the response unaltered in case it needs to be referenced in the future.</p>
			<p>Students will be able to see how many points the assignment is worth. While this value is changeable after students submit their answer, changing its value to the appropriate number or to ungraded will cause less confusion in the future.</p>
			<p>Once all the <a id="_idIndexMarker179"/>necessary fields are filled in and the appropriate question options are set, clicking on the <strong class="bold">Ask</strong> button will post the question, as follows:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.5_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 4.5 – The Ask button for a finished question post&#13;&#10;" width="957" height="508"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.5 – The Ask button for a finished question post</p>
			<p>Questions in <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> appear with a question mark icon, and you will be able to see how many students have answered the question as well as when the question is due. This is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.6_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 4.6 – The Teacher view of a question post&#13;&#10;" width="802" height="271"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.6 – The Teacher view of a question post</p>
			<p>Making changes to a question post, such as editing and deleting, require the same steps as for an announcement post. Refer to the previous chapter, <a href="B16846_03_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor040"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Sending Your First Announcement</em>, for the steps.</p>
			<p>When publishing a <a id="_idIndexMarker180"/>question post (or any other post in the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> section), a notification will appear in the Stream, as shown:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.7_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 4.7 – A question post notification in a Class Stream&#13;&#10;" width="867" height="218"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.7 – A question post notification in a Class Stream</p>
			<p>How published posts in <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> appear in the Stream can be changed in the <strong class="bold">Class</strong> settings. Classwork notifications show condensed notifications by default but can show all details and attachments or be hidden altogether.</p>
			<p>Students will see the same notification in the Stream; however, their view of the question post in the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> section will be slightly different than the teacher's view.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>Student view</h2>
			<p>Students will only <a id="_idIndexMarker181"/>see the question and will be able to respond to the question and submit their response directly on the post. If a student clicks on the notification in the Stream, they will be directed to the full question post, where they can submit their response. However, if a student clicks on the question in the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> section, they will have to click on the <strong class="bold">View question</strong> button before they can respond to the question:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.8_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 4.8 – The question post in the Classwork section&#13;&#10;" width="814" height="226"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.8 – The question post in the Classwork section</p>
			<p>Inside the question post, students can view the instructions and enter their response in the answer box on the right column. When a student is ready to submit their response, they will click the <strong class="bold">Turn in</strong> button:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.9_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 4.9 – The answer box and Turn in button of a question post&#13;&#10;" width="814" height="398"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.9 – The answer box and Turn in button of a question post</p>
			<p>Once the student's <a id="_idIndexMarker182"/>answer is submitted, if the question option is enabled, they will be able to see how many other students have replied to their response, as well as viewing other students' responses. In the answer box, a button will appear to <strong class="bold">See classmate answers</strong>. In addition, tabs will appear at the top of the question post for <strong class="bold">Classmate answers</strong> and <strong class="bold">Your answer</strong>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.10_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 4.10 – Button and tab to view classmate responses&#13;&#10;" width="910" height="386"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.10 – Button and tab to view classmate responses</p>
			<p>The following is a screenshot of the <strong class="bold">Classmate answers</strong> section to a question:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.11_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 4.11 – The Classmate answers page of a Question post&#13;&#10;" width="913" height="480"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.11 – The Classmate answers page of a Question post</p>
			<p>Google Classroom <a id="_idIndexMarker183"/>utilizes several Google apps to communicate with students. Not only does Google Classroom send an email, because this question has a due date, but it will also create an event on the due date to remind the student in Google Calendar. Furthermore, when the student goes to the Stream in Google Classroom, the first box in the sidebar, shown in the following screenshot, will contain the question:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.12_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 4.12 – Upcoming posts with due dates&#13;&#10;" width="309" height="205"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.12 – Upcoming posts with due dates</p>
			<p>Students are still able to submit responses after the due date. The question post will show a <strong class="bold">Missing</strong> indicator at the top of the post, as shown here:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.13_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 4.13 – Missing indicator for posts not turned in&#13;&#10;" width="838" height="210"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.13 – Missing indicator for posts not turned in</p>
			<p>Once the response is<a id="_idIndexMarker184"/> submitted the post will indicate that the question was responded to late:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.14_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 4.14 – Turned in late indicator for posts&#13;&#10;" width="853" height="216"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.14 – Turned in late indicator for posts</p>
			<p>At the time of writing, there is no way to prevent students from turning in work late. Furthermore, once a due date is passed, the upcoming events box in the Stream (<em class="italic">Figure 4.12</em>) no longer displays the post regardless of whether the task is turned in.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/>Replying to student responses</h1>
			<p>Teachers and<a id="_idIndexMarker185"/> students can reply to student responses. Replying to a response is not the same as commenting on a post in Classwork. Commenting on a question post is about the content of the question. For example, a student may comment on a question to ask whether the due date can be extended. Replying to a response is only about that individual's response. Once on the <strong class="bold">Student answers</strong> page, teachers and students reply to student responses in the same way. Since the previous section demonstrates how students navigate the <strong class="bold">Classmate answers</strong> page, the following steps walk through a teacher replying to a student's question response:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> section, expand the question post by clicking on its title, then click <strong class="bold">View question</strong>. The next page will show all the student responses:<div><img src="img/Figure_4.15_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 4.15 – The View question button of a question post&#13;&#10;" width="725" height="247"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.15 – The View question button of a question post</p></li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Reply</strong> icon below the response:<div><img src="img/Figure_4.16_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 4.16 – The Reply icon below a student response&#13;&#10;" width="484" height="172"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.16 – The Reply icon below a student response</p></li>
				<li>Type a reply<a id="_idIndexMarker186"/> and click the post icon:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.17_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure Fig 4.17 – The post icon&#13;&#10;" width="657" height="186"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure Fig 4.17 – The post icon</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.18 – A reply to a student question response</p>
			<p>In the question <a id="_idIndexMarker187"/>post, teachers will see a <strong class="bold">Student answers</strong> tab where students see a <strong class="bold">Classmate Answers</strong> tab. The main difference, apart from the name of the tab, is that the teacher is able to assign a grade to a student's response, which is explained later in the chapter:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.19_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 4.19 – The Student answers tab in the Teacher view&#13;&#10;" width="565" height="148"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.19 – The Student answers tab in the Teacher view</p>
			<p>If the replies to responses become too numerous, click on the reply count directly below the student's response to collapse all replies for that response:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.20_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 4.20 – The collapsed reply button&#13;&#10;" width="647" height="172"/>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.20 – The collapsed reply button</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-62"><a id="_idTextAnchor061"/>Creating multiple-choice questions</h1>
			<p>Question posts<a id="_idIndexMarker188"/> can either be short-answer or they can be multiple-choice. To switch between short-answer, which is the default option, and multiple-choice, use the first drop-down menu in the question options, as shown:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.21_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 4.21 – The Multiple choice option&#13;&#10;" width="531" height="216"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.21 – The Multiple choice option</p>
			<p>Each question can <a id="_idIndexMarker189"/>only have a single multiple-choice question. <a href="B16846_07_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor098"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Creating Multiple Choice and Fill-in-the-blank Quizzes using Google Forms</em>, shows how to create assignment posts with several multiple-choice questions. After selecting the <strong class="bold">Multiple choice</strong> option, radio buttons will appear below the question options. To add more multiple-choice options, click on <strong class="bold">Add option</strong> in the list:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.22_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 4.22 – Adding another multiple-choice selector to a question post&#13;&#10;" width="769" height="278"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.22 – Adding another multiple-choice selector to a question post</p>
			<p>Multiple-choice questions only have one option: <strong class="bold">Students can see class summary</strong>. The checkbox is found below the <strong class="bold">Topic</strong> section of the question post. The results will be displayed on the post after the student has submitted their results. An example of this option, which is enabled by default, is shown as follows:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.23_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 4.23 – The class summary of student responses&#13;&#10;" width="553" height="343"/>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.23 – The class summary of student responses</p>
			<p>In the preceding <a id="_idIndexMarker190"/>screenshot, the darker-gray sections on the left visually represent the number of times the choice is selected while the numbers on the right indicate the total number of students who selected that option.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip – when immediate feedback is bad</p>
			<p class="callout">During my teaching, I found that disabling immediate feedback provided more meaningful feedback than letting students see the class summary immediately. With immediate feedback, students who completed the question quickly could not see the rest of the results without refreshing Google Classroom and the stragglers could wait and see what most of the class selected and choose accordingly. Instead, I found that revealing the summary after the majority of the students had completed the question worked better. Clicking on the title of a published multiple-choice question post will go to the summary of responses. More about this page in the next section.</p>
			<p>For multiple-choice questions, placing the stem of the question in the <strong class="bold">Instructions</strong> section of the question post instead of the title allows students to see the entire stem on the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> page. Then, students can answer the question without opening the question post. An example of how the title and instructions appear in the question post in Classwork is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.24_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 4.24 – The title versus instructions of a question post when viewed in Classwork&#13;&#10;" width="779" height="261"/>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.24 – The title versus instructions of a question post when viewed in Classwork</p>
			<p>Once all the necessary <a id="_idIndexMarker191"/>fields are filled in and the appropriate question options are set, clicking on the <strong class="bold">Ask</strong> button will post the question. Once students have responded to the question post, you can grade their responses.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-63"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>Grading a question</h1>
			<p>Question posts allow<a id="_idIndexMarker192"/> teachers to track which students have responded to the question, as well as assigning grades to those responses. Use the following steps to assign a grade:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> section, expand the question post by clicking on its title, then click <strong class="bold">View question</strong>. The next page will show all the student responses:<div><img src="img/Figure_4.25_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 4.25 – The View question button of a question post&#13;&#10;" width="675" height="220"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.25 – The View question button of a question post</p></li>

For example, an A grade will be 4 points, a B grade 3 points, and so on.</p></li>
				<li>Assign the grade to the right column beside the student. Continue assigning a grade to students until all students are graded:<div><img src="img/Figure_4.28_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 4.28 – The grade column&#13;&#10;" width="432" height="88"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.28 – The grade column</p><p>Google Classroom orders students by whether the question is turned in.

Depending on<a id="_idIndexMarker197"/> your <strong class="bold">Student Information System</strong> (<strong class="bold">SIS</strong>), CSV files exported from Google Classroom may be easily imported into your school's SIS.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important</p>
			<p class="callout">At the time of writing, Google Classroom has built-in synchronization functionality with the Infinite Campus, Skyward 2.0, Capita SIMS, Follett Aspen, and Aeries SISes. If Google Classroom can synchronize with a third-party SIS, implementing grade categories into your question and assignment posts may improve your marking and reporting workflow. These steps are found at the beginning of <a href="B16846_09_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor117"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Customizing to Your Subject</em>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>Leaving a question ungraded</h2>
			<p>Another option when <a id="_idIndexMarker198"/>grading a question is to not assign a point value. If the points were not changed to ungraded when the question was created, it can also be changed in the points drop-down menu. When returning the question, you will still be able to give feedback with private comments:</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-65"><a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>Viewing a returned grade</h2>
			<p>Once the question <a id="_idIndexMarker199"/>is returned to the students, they will be able to view the grade and private comments. Students can access a returned question by clicking on the provided link in the email notification or clicking on the title of the question post in the Stream. Furthermore, the question post in Classwork will also indicate in the top-right corner that the question has been returned:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.34_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 4.34 – A question post in Classwork that is graded and the returned indicator&#13;&#10;" width="839" height="225"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.34 – A question post in Classwork that is graded and the returned indicator</p>
			<p>The student's answer page will display the grade below the question title. Private comments will appear at the bottom of the right column:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.35_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 4.35 – The Student view of the returned grade and private comments&#13;&#10;" width="925" height="572"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.35 – The Student view of the returned grade and private comments</p>
			<p>Students can add a <a id="_idIndexMarker200"/>follow-up private comment after the question is returned. This private comment thread is similar to a student following up on a paper assignment in person.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-66"><a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>The question post provides several tools that enhance what you can do with the Stream to promote discussion within your class. It allows you to easily track which students have responded to the question that is posed and grade those responses. When integrating question posts into your teaching, they can be used to enhance class discussions, as well as promoting out-of-class discussions for your students.</p>
			<p>You are now able to create short-answer and multiple-choice question posts within the Stream of your Classroom, assign a due date, and grade and return questions with feedback. Students are now able to reply to each other's responses and your feedback. The grades, student responses, and feedback are all stored in the post, which can be easily found on the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> page.</p>
			<p>This chapter did not explore every feature of grading in Google Classroom. Some features, such as how a student views all question and assignment grades and how teachers view student grades and assignments in a spreadsheet-like view, will be explored in <a href="B16846_05_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor066"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Handing out and Taking in Assignments</em>, when there are more student grades to view.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will explore the final post type: the assignment post. With this type of post, students will be able to respond by submitting documents.</p>
