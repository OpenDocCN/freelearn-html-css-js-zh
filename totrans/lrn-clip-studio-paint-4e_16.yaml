    to add colors without having mishaps such as overflooding areas you want to color.
    Then, we will learn how to change the colors in line art for an organic organic-looking
    finish. Next, we will learn what layer blending modes are and the benefits of
    using them, with rich visual references. Then, we will explore the time-saver
    function, Shading Assist. We will move on to learn how to use color mixing for
    a realistic way of creating a desired color. Finally, we will look into Color
    Match options, filters, and the Liquify tool to change the final look of the artwork.
    By the end of this chapter, you will be able to handle digital coloring easily
    and effectively, which means you can expand your range of color expressions.

- en: Let’s have a look at reference layers. **Reference layers** are a game changer
    for anyone who does digital art. Reference layers allow us to make some aspects
    of the digital coloring process a lot easier. Many digital art beginners make
    a mistake when they start adding color to their art. Once they have some nice
    inks down, they grab the Fill tool in whatever software they’re using and start
    adding color willy-nilly to the same layer that their line art is on. This produces
    results similar to what’s shown in *Figure 16.1*.

    see a slight line of white and gray pixels that haven’t been filled in. This results
    in an unpolished look, and taking a pen tool and going over the unfilled area
    takes a lot of time to clean it up.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each artist is unique and has their own way of working, but it is recommended
    that you utilize your layers to their full advantage and also to make your process
    easier. Line art should be on one layer, and coloring should be on another. This
    is very easy to do if you create your inked lines digitally because, on the layer,
    you should have just ink lines and the rest of the space is transparent. If you
    have ink lines from a scanned image, the whole layer is opaque, which means you
    can’t separate layers of ink lines and background color. All you then need to
    do is create a new layer below the ink layer and then put your colors on that
    layer, as shown in the layer setup in *Figure 16.2*.

    below their lines, then take the pen tool and draw around the outline of each
    area on the new layer so it can be filled in on the color layer. This also takes
    a lot of time and effort and can be done much more easily and effectively using
    the tools and features built into Clip Studio Paint.

    adding patterns, shading, lighting, and special effects later.

    their pieces. As with almost anything in art, this is really up to the artist.
    While you can put everything on one layer, it is recommended to separate line
    art and color layers so that colors can be changed without having to change the
    line art, and coloring and special effects are made easier. Some artists put all
    their flat colors on one layer, then have one layer for shadows and another for
    highlights. Some artists have a separate layer for each and every color used in
    their pieces. It depends on how you want to work as an artist, and sometimes it
    is up to the specs of your computer! A computer with less RAM and hard drive space
    won’t be able to handle a file with lots of layers, so keep this in mind.

    (magic wand) tool to select the flat colors from the **flats** layer and then
    add shadows and highlights on another layer using the brush of your choice. Shading
    is the word we use for adding darker colors to our art to create shadow, and then
    the art will look three-dimensional, be able to tell the time of the day, and
    depict a mood. Highlights are for adding a lighter color to create shiny effects
    on glistening eyes, hair, mechanics, tools, weapons, stars, and wet objects. Both
    processes are so much fun and creative.

    This makes it the ideal selection for something like a scanned ink image. By setting
    the scanned image to **Multiply**, digital colors can be applied beneath the line
    art to finish the illustration. **Multiply** also makes colors darker by combining
    them with the colors below them. This makes the **Multiply** mode ideal for shadow
    layers.

    section earlier, is a wonderful skill to have. Compared with observation drawings,
    manga drawings often have very limited shading, but at the same time, it’s very
    tactical. One obvious place to add a shade is un derneath the face, which instantly
    lifts the face color and makes it stand out; plus, we can tell the audience that
    the character’s head is a three-dimensional object. Other shading places will
    be under eyelids, nose, body, and some parts obviously beneath bigger objects.

    you want to add by controlling how much color you will put using the **Soft airbrush**
    tool. We can always change the **opacity** of the layer if we need an even softer
    effect. **Soft light** mode is also used to mark the light zones with the light
    color as well as the shadow zones with a cold tone. Besides the cheeks, it works
    very well to add red tones on the articulations (ears, elbows, knees, etc.) due
    to the blood flow. Read on to find out how to add a lighting effect with the **Screen**
    layer blending mode.

    color close to white, while the highlights on the clothes still retain the turquoise
    hue. This mode gives us an effect that’s just the opposite of what the **Multiply**
    mode does – the **Screen** mode makes color on layers underneath lighter, while
    **Multiply** mode makes them darker.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have learned how to add shade with the **Multiply** mode, rosy cheeks with
    the **Soft light** mode, and finally, a light effect with the **Screen** mode.
    These are just three of the many blending modes available to us. By combining
    layer modes and opacity in different ways, we can create many different effects.
    Experimentation is the key here because each artist is different and likes to
    create a specific look with their art. Changing the layer mode does no damage
    to the original layer, so play with the layer modes in your art to see what different
    looks you can create using them and different colors to create shadows and highlights

- en: There is, of course, no paper texture that really exists in digital drawings
    since they’re not drawn on physical paper, but we can add it as a final touch
    to our art. We can express a sense of paper texture on a digital drawing using
    the pencil or watercolor tools to some extent, but it is easier to add it to the
    entire page by using texture materials and layer blending modes.

- en: In this chapter, we started applying color to our images. We started out by
    discussing reference layers and how we can use them to make our colored flats
    easier with anti-overflow brushes and the Fill tools. Then, we explored how to
    change line art color, and looked at three of the many blending modes available
    in Clip Studio Paint that can help us shade and highlight our images. We also
    learned how to shade using Shading Assist, changing the tone of a finished piece
    of colored art using the Color Match options, and we explored adding the **Chromatic
    aberration** filter and the **Noise** filter. We explored adding a paper texture
    to our art. Finally, we learned how to use the Liquify tool to retouch the finished
    art. You can apply these new coloring skills to both digitally drawn and scanned
    manga images, for a more polished and professional look.
