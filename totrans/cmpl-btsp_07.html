In this chapter, we're going to change gears and learn about Sass, which will allow you to customize the look and feel of your components. I'll start by introducing some Sass basics that you need to know, move on to writing some basic code, and then show you the power of using variables in your components to save yourself valuable time when creating your web app or project.</p></div>

If you've never used or heard of Sass before, it's a CSS preprocessor. A preprocessor extends regular CSS by allowing the use of things such as variables, operators, and mixins in CSS. Sass is written during the development stage of your project and it needs to be compiled into regular CSS before you deploy your project into production. I'll cover that in more detail in the next section but don't worry because Harp.js makes this really easy to do.</p><p class="calibre7">Up until version 4 of Bootstrap, the CSS preprocessor used was actually Less. For a good while both Sass and Less were popular in frontend design circles. However, over the last few years, while Sass has emerged as the best choice for developers, the Bootstrap team decided to make the change in version 4. If you are familiar with Less but have never used Sass, don't worry as they are pretty similar to use so it won't take much to get you up-to-speed.</p></div></div>

Before you can deploy the project, you need to convert or compile the Sass files into regular CSS files. Normally this would require you to install a Ruby gem and you would have to manually compile your code before you can test it. Luckily for us, Harp.js actually has an Sass compiler built into it. So when you run the <code class="literal">harp compile</code> command to build your templates, it will also build your Sass files into regular CSS. I bet you're starting to like Harp even more after learning that.</p></div>

Head to your project directory and navigate to the CSS directory. In this directory, create a new file called <code class="literal">custom.scss</code>.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title1"><a id="note21" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre7">The file extension used for Sass files is <code class="literal">.scss</code>.</p></div><p class="calibre7">What we're doing here is creating a custom style sheet that we are going to use to overwrite some of the default Bootstrap look-and-feel CSS. To do this, we need to load this custom file after the Bootstrap framework CSS file in our layout file. Open up <code class="literal">_layout.ejs</code> in the root of the project directory and insert the following line of code after <code class="literal">bootstrap.min.css</code>. Both lines together should look like this:</p><pre class="programlisting">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/bootstrap.min.css"&gt; 
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/custom.css"&gt; 
</pre><p class="calibre7">Note here that I'm using the <code class="literal">.css</code> file extension for <code class="literal">custom.css</code>. This is because, after the files are compiled, the template will be looking for the actual CSS file, not the Sass file. The critical part is just that the actual filenames match and that you use <code class="literal">.css</code> in the layout file. Before we go any further, let's test out our Sass file to make sure it is set up properly. Open up <code class="literal">custom.scss</code> in your text editor and add the following code:</p><pre class="programlisting">body { 
   background: red; 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre7">This is just a simple way to make sure that Sass is compiling to CSS and is being inserted into our layout. Compile your project and launch the server. If you've done everything correctly the background for your homepage should be red and look like this:</p><p class="calibre7">
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00115.jpeg" alt="Updating the blog project" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">
</p><p class="calibre7">Hopefully this is what you're seeing and you can confirm you've set up your file correctly. Once you've successfully done this, delete the CSS we entered in the Sass file.</p><div class="note" title="Note"><h3 class="title1"><a id="note22" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre7">It's perfectly acceptable to write regular CSS in Sass files. Ideally, you want to combine regular CSS code with Sass syntax to take full advantage of the preprocessor.</p></div><p class="calibre7">Now that you've finished setting up your files, let's start to learn a little bit more about using Sass in your project.</p></div></div>

<div class="book" title="Using Sass in the blog project">
<div class="book" title="Using variables"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_pb_2"><a id="ch08lvl2sec126" class="calibre1"/>Using variables</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">In Sass, variables are called by using the <code class="literal">$</code> sign character. If you're familiar with Less, the <code class="literal">@</code> symbol is used for variables. So in that case, all you would need to do is use <code class="literal">$</code> instead of <code class="literal">@</code>. To write a variable, start with the <code class="literal">$</code> sign and then insert a descriptive keyword that can be anything you like. Here are a few examples of generic variable names:</p><pre class="programlisting">$background-color 
$text-size 
$font-face 
$margin 
</pre><p class="calibre7">I've named these pretty generically and they actually match some CSS property names. This is a good idea and they are easy to reuse and make sense of if multiple developers are working on the same project. However, like I said, you can name your variables whatever you want. If you'd like to get more creative, you could name variables like this:</p><pre class="programlisting">$matts-best-color 
$awesome-background-color 
$fantastic-font-face 
</pre><p class="calibre7">These are extreme examples and it is advisable not to name your variables in this way. To you <code class="literal">$awesome-background-color</code> might mean red but to another person it could mean anything. It's always a good idea to name your variables in a descriptive manner that makes sense.</p><p class="calibre7">I've shown you how to write the variable name but the other side of the equation is the actual value for the variable. Let's add in some sample values for our first set of variable names:</p><pre class="programlisting">$background-color: #fff; 
$text-size: 16px; 
$font-face: helvetica, sans-serif; 
$margin: 1em; 
</pre><p class="calibre7">You write Sass variables the same way that you would write CSS properties. It's also worth noting that you should enter your variables at the very top of your style sheet so that they can be used in all of the CSS you write after them.</p></div></div>

<div class="book" title="Using Sass in the blog project">
<div class="book" title="Using the variables in CSS"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_pb_3"><a id="ch08lvl2sec127" class="calibre1"/>Using the variables in CSS</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">Now that we've written some variables, let's actually insert them into some CSS. After the variables in <code class="literal">custom.scss</code>, enter the following code:</p><pre class="programlisting">body { 
   background: $background-color; 
   font-size: $text-size; 
   font-family: $font-face; 
   margin: $margin; 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre7">So instead of using actual values for our CSS properties, we're using the variable names that we set up. This starts to get more powerful as we add more CSS. Let's reuse some of these variables:</p><pre class="programlisting">body { 
   background: $background-color; 
   font-size: $text-size; 
   font-family: $font-face; 
   margin: $margin; 
} 
 
h1 { 
   font-size: 36px; 
   font-family: georgia, serif; 
} 
 
h2 { 
   font-size: $text-size; 
   font-family: $font-face; 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre7">In this example, you can see a few things going on that I should explain:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">For the <code class="literal">&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag, I'm not using any variables. I'm using regular CSS property values.</li><li class="listitem">For the <code class="literal">&lt;h2&gt;</code> tag, I'm reusing the same variables to insert the <code class="literal">font-size</code> and <code class="literal">font-family</code> values.</li></ul></div><p class="calibre7">As your style sheet grows longer, I'm sure you'll see the value in this strategy. For example, if I decide I want to change my <code class="literal">font-size</code> to <code class="literal">24px</code>, all I need to do is change the value for the <code class="literal">$text-size</code> variable to <code class="literal">24px</code>. I don't have to go through my entire style sheet and change all the values individually. These are just the basics of what you can do with variables. Let's look at a more advanced use case.</p></div></div>

<div class="book" title="Using Sass in the blog project">
<div class="book" title="Using other variables as variable values"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_pb_4"><a id="ch08lvl2sec128" class="calibre1"/>Using other variables as variable values</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">That might sound like a bit of a mouthful, but you can actually use a variable as the default value for another variable. A good example of where you might want to do this is when you are defining a color palette. You can switch the hex values to readable names and then use them for your other variables. This is much easier to scan and understand when you are debugging your code. Here's an example of what I mean:</p><pre class="programlisting">$black: #000; 
$white: #fff; 
$red: #c00; 
 
$background-color: $white; 
$text-color: $black; 
$link-color: $red; 
</pre><p class="calibre7">Let me break down what is happening here for you:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">First I've created three color variables for <code class="literal">black</code>, <code class="literal">white,</code> and <code class="literal">red</code></li><li class="listitem">Next I've created three CSS property variables for <code class="literal">background-color</code>, <code class="literal">text-color</code>, and <code class="literal">link-color</code>; the values for these CSS property variables are the color variables</li></ul></div><p class="calibre7">Instead of using hex number values for the CSS property variables, I used a color keyword variable which is much easier to read and understand. That concludes the introduction to variables in Sass. Next we'll learn about importing different files into <code class="literal">custom.css</code> and using partials.</p></div></div>

<div class="book" title="Importing partials in Sass"><div class="book" id="2E6E42-d17423bd3b664255b5fd09e37e25e334"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch08lvl1sec64" class="calibre1"/>Importing partials in Sass</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">Just as you can do in <code class="literal">Harp.js</code>, you can use partials in Sass. If you've forgotten what a partial is, it's a little snippet of code that is saved into a different file and then imported into the main CSS theme or layout, in the case of Harp. This can be handy for making your CSS modular and easier to manage. For example, it would make a ton of sense to break every Bootstrap component into its own CSS file and then use the <code class="literal">@import</code> directive to bring them all into a single master theme, which is then included in your project. Let's go over an example of how you could do this for a single component. In your project, go to the <code class="literal">/css</code> directory and create a new sub-folder called <code class="literal">/components</code>. The the full path should be:</p><pre class="programlisting">/css/components 
</pre><p class="calibre7">In the <code class="literal">/components</code> directory, create a new Sass file and name it <code class="literal">_buttons.scss</code>. Make sure you always insert an underscore at the start of the filename of a partial. The compiler will then ignore these files as the underscore means it is being inserted into another file. Enter the following at the top of the file as a marker:</p><pre class="programlisting">/* buttons */ 
</pre><p class="calibre7">Save the buttons file and then open up <code class="literal">custom.scss</code> and add the following line of code to the file:</p><pre class="programlisting">@import "components/_buttons.scss"; 
</pre><p class="calibre7">That line of code uses the <code class="literal">@import</code> rule, which will allow us to import the <code class="literal">_buttons.scss</code> file into our main theme file that we are calling <code class="literal">custom.scss</code>. As I've mentioned, the reason you need to do this is for maintainability. This makes the code much easier to read and to add/remove components, which is just another way of saying it makes it more modular.</p><p class="calibre7">Before we can test this out to make sure it works, we need to add some code to our <code class="literal">_buttons.scss</code> file. Let's add some simple CSS to change the primary button as an example:</p><pre class="programlisting">.btn-primary { 
  background-color: green; 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre7">After adding this code, save the file and do a <code class="literal">harp compile</code>. Then launch the server and check out the home page; the buttons will be green like this:</p><p class="calibre7">
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00116.jpeg" alt="Importing partials in Sass" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">
</p><p class="calibre7">After testing that out, you may want to take that custom code out unless you want the buttons to remain green. That's just a simple example of how you can use partials to make your Bootstrap components more modular. I'll get into that topic in greater depth in a future chapter but for now we are going to focus on using Sass mixins.</p></div>

<div class="book" title="Importing partials in Sass">
<div class="book" title="Using mixins"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_pb_1"><a id="ch08lvl2sec129" class="calibre1"/>Using mixins</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">Writing something in CSS, such as, for example, browser vendor prefixes, can be really tedious. Mixins allow you to group CSS declarations together so that you can reuse them through your project. This is a great because you can include the code for, say, a <code class="literal">border-radius</code>, using one line of code instead of multiple lines for each browser. To start, open up <code class="literal">custom.scss</code> and insert the following code at the top of the file:</p><pre class="programlisting">@mixin border-radius($radius) { 
  -webkit-border-radius: $radius; 
     -moz-border-radius: $radius; 
      -ms-border-radius: $radius; 
          border-radius: $radius; 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre7">Let's go over a few things that are happening here:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">A mixin is always started in Sass with the <code class="literal">@mixin</code> keyword</li><li class="listitem">Following that, you want to include the property name to target as well as set a variable, in this case <code class="literal">$radius</code></li><li class="listitem">We then apply the <code class="literal">$radius</code> variable to each browser prefix instance</li></ul></div><p class="calibre7">We've set up the mixin to handle the <code class="literal">border-radius</code> property but we still need to add the corner value to an element. Let's change the <code class="literal">border-radius</code> value for the default Bootstrap button. Open up <code class="literal">_buttons.scss</code> and insert the following code:</p><pre class="programlisting">.btn { 
  @include border-radius(20px); 
 } 
</pre><p class="calibre7">Let me explain what is happening here:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">I'm targeting all Bootstrap buttons by inserting the <code class="literal">.btn</code> class</li><li class="listitem">Inserting the <code class="literal">@include</code> keyword will grab the <code class="literal">border-radius</code> mixin</li><li class="listitem">Lastly, I've provided a value of <code class="literal">20px</code>, which will make our buttons look really rounded on each end</li></ul></div><p class="calibre7">Save your file, run the <code class="literal">harp compile</code> command, and then, when you view the project in the browser, it should look like this:</p><p class="calibre7">
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00117.jpeg" alt="Using mixins" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">
</p><p class="calibre7">That concludes a fairly simple example of how to use mixins in Bootstrap 4. You can use them for many other reasons but replacing CSS3 vendor prefixes is one of the most common and useful. Next we'll cover a slightly more complicated topic in Sass, which is the use of operators.</p></div></div>

<div class="book" title="Importing partials in Sass">
<div class="book" title="How to use operators"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_pb_2"><a id="ch08lvl2sec130" class="calibre1"/>How to use operators</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">Sass allows you to perform basic math operations in CSS, which is useful for a number of reasons. First of all, you can use the following operators <code class="literal">+</code>, <code class="literal">-</code>, <code class="literal">*</code>,<code class="literal"> /</code>, and <code class="literal">%</code>. To give you an understanding of how you can use operators in CSS, let's learn how to convert a pixel-based grid into percentages. We'll create two columns in pixels and then use some Sass to convert them to percentages. Open up <code class="literal">custom.scss</code> and insert the following code:</p><pre class="programlisting">.left-column { 
  width: 700px / 1000px * 100%; 
} 
 
.right-column { 
  width: 300px / 1000px * 100%; 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre7">Now, I've created two columns here. The <code class="literal">.left-column</code> class will have a width of 70% after we compile this Sass operator. The <code class="literal">.right-column</code> class will have a width of 30%. So if we add those together we'll get roughly a three-quarter layout with a larger column on the left and a smaller column on the right. Run a <code class="literal">harp compile</code> command to build this code and then open up <code class="literal">custom.css</code> in the <code class="literal">/www/css folder</code>. There you should find the following code:</p><pre class="programlisting">.left-column { 
  width:70%; 
} 
 
.right-column { 
  width:30%; 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre7">As you can see, our Sass operators have been converted into regular percentage values. That's just one way you can use operators in Sass; I'd encourage you to play around more with them. Next we're going to learn how to set up a library of Sass variables that you can use to create a Bootstrap theme.</p></div></div>

<div class="book" title="Creating a collection of variables"><div class="book" id="2F4UM2-d17423bd3b664255b5fd09e37e25e334"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch08lvl1sec65" class="calibre1"/>Creating a collection of variables</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">One of the main things you'll want to do when using Sass in Bootstrap is to create a library of global variables that can be used throughout your theme. Think of things such as colors, backgrounds, typography, links, borders, margins, and padding. It's best to only define these common properties once and then you can reuse them through different components. Before we go too far, we need to create a new <code class="literal">.scss</code> file. Open up your text editor, create a new file, and call it <code class="literal">_variables.scss</code>. Save that file to the <code class="literal">/css/components</code> directory. For now, you can just leave it blank.</p></div>

Open up <code class="literal">custom.css</code> in your text editor and paste the following line of code at the top of the file:</p><pre class="programlisting">@import "components/_variables.scss"; 
</pre><p class="calibre7">It's important to note that this file must be at the top of your custom style sheet file. The variables will cascade through all the code that follows them so they must load first. Let's start filling out our variables file with a color palette.</p></div></div>

Let's start by inserting a color palette into the variables file like this:</p><pre class="programlisting">$red: #e74c3c; 
$red2: #c0392b; 
$blue: #3498db; 
$blue2: #2980b9; 
$green: #2ecc71;

$yellow: #f1c40f; 
$yellow2: #f39c12; 
$purple: #9b59b6; 
$purple2: #8e44ad; 
$white: #fff; 
$off-white: #f5f5f5; 
$grey: #ccc; 
$dark-grey: #333; 
$black: #000; 
</pre><p class="calibre7">As you can see, I've set up a palette of several colors that I'll use through my components and later my theme. Here are a few key points to keep in mind:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">It's good to have two variations for your key colors. This comes in handy for a component such as a button where <code class="literal">$red</code> would be the static color and <code class="literal">$red2</code> would be the hover or active color for the button.</li><li class="listitem">I'm guessing you can already see how using variable names such as <code class="literal">$purple</code> is much more readable than hex values in a long style sheet.</li></ul></div></div></div>

<div class="book" title="Creating a collection of variables">

As we move through this variables file, we're going to create a variable for all properties that get used over and over again in our style sheet.</p><p class="calibre7">Add the following background color variables to the file:</p><pre class="programlisting">$primary-background: $white; 
$secondary-background: $off-white; 
$inverse-background: $black; 
</pre><p class="calibre7">Let me explain, as best practice, how I have set this up:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">First of all, I'm using the color variables we just set up as the values for our new background color variables. This keeps things simple and it also allows you to change the color and have it cascade through all your other variables. This is a great time-saving tip.</li><li class="listitem">At the very least, it's a good idea to define a <code class="literal">primary</code>, <code class="literal">secondary</code>, and <code class="literal">inverse</code> background color variable. Note how I'm reusing the same language here that Bootstrap uses. This is a good practice to follow. Feel free to define additional background colors if you think you'll need them in your project.</li></ul></div><p class="calibre7">Setting up the background color variables is pretty simple. Next let's set up our base typography variables.</p></div></div>

<div class="book" title="Creating a collection of variables">
<div class="book" title="Setting up variables for typography"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_pb_4"><a id="ch08lvl2sec134" class="calibre1"/>Setting up variables for typography</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">The next section of variables we are going to set up is for the base typography styles. Insert the following code after the background colors:</p><pre class="programlisting">$body-copy: helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif; 
$heading-copy: helvetica, arial, verdana, sans-serif; 
$base-font-size: 16px; 
$font-size: 1em; 
$base-line-height: 1.75; 
</pre><p class="calibre7">Let me explain why I'm setting the following variables for the typography:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">For consistency, it's good to have a body and heading typeface. In this case, I'm using the same font stack for both but you could easily change the heading variable to something else. As you are coding your CSS, it's really easy to think of the <code class="literal">font-family</code> in either the body or heading version, compared with trying to remember the entire font stack for each, which also involves much more typing.</li><li class="listitem">For the <code class="literal">$base-font-size</code> variable, we are going to use a pixel value. This is one of the only places you'll see pixels and it's set to the base em size that everything else will work off. Remember that ems are a relative sizing unit, so if you ever want to make all your components a little bigger or smaller, you can just tweak this one pixel value.</li><li class="listitem">We also need a <code class="literal">$font-size</code> variable, which will be set to <code class="literal">1em</code>. This is a base unit and it can easily be changed in other selectors by using Sass operators. The reason we set it to <code class="literal">1em</code> is because it simply makes the math easy to do.</li><li class="listitem">Finally, I set the <code class="literal">$base-line-height </code>to <code class="literal">1.75</code> because I like a little extra line spacing in my copy. You could choose to leave this out if you are fine with the Bootstrap default, which is closer to <code class="literal">1.5</code>.</li></ul></div><p class="calibre7">Now that we've set up our typography variables, let's move on to coding our text colors.</p></div></div>

Insert the following markup after the typography variables in the file:</p><pre class="programlisting">$primary-text: $black; 
$light-text: $grey; 
$loud-text: $black; 
$inverse-text: $white; 
$code-text: $red; 
$pre-text: $blue; 
</pre><p class="calibre7">Let me break down how each variable is set up:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">As in the background color variables, we are using a variable name for the value of our text color variables. I've included a variable called <code class="literal">$primary-text</code> and set it to black, following the same naming convention that was previously established.</li><li class="listitem">I've added <code class="literal">$light-text</code> and <code class="literal">$loud-text</code> variables so we can easily apply lighter or darker text throughout our components.</li><li class="listitem">I've also included an <code class="literal">$inverse-text</code> variable to be used with the corresponding background color.</li><li class="listitem">Finally, I've set up default colors for the <code class="literal">&lt;pre&gt;</code> and <code class="literal">&lt;code&gt;</code> tags, which we will use to overwrite the default colors so they match our theme and color palette.</li></ul></div><p class="calibre7">That finishes off the color variables that I recommend setting up. Feel free to add more if you have other uses you want to cover. Next we'll continue with some text colors by adding links.</p></div></div>

<div class="book" title="Creating a collection of variables">
<div class="book" title="Coding variables for links"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_pb_6"><a id="ch08lvl2sec136" class="calibre1"/>Coding variables for links</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">An extension of basic text colors will be colors for links in our project. Go ahead and add the following code after the text colors in the file:</p><pre class="programlisting">$primary-link-color: $purple; 
$primary-link-color-hover: $purple2; 
$primary-link-color-active: $purple2; 
</pre><p class="calibre7">In this case, I've decided to only define a primary link color to keep things simple. In your own projects, you will likely want to come up with a couple more variations.</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">For the static link color, I'm using the <code class="literal">$purple</code> color variable.</li><li class="listitem">For the hover and active states of the primary link, I'm using <code class="literal">$purple2</code>. As I previously mentioned, this is an example of why it's a good idea to have two variations of each color in your palette.</li></ul></div><p class="calibre7">Like I said, I've kept the link variables simple. It's nice to try and keep your set of variables as compact as possible. If you have too many then it starts to defeat the purpose of using them as it will be harder to remember them in your code. Next let's cover the variables we should set up for borders.</p></div></div>

<div class="book" title="Creating a collection of variables">
<div class="book" title="Setting up border variables"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_pb_7"><a id="ch08lvl2sec137" class="calibre1"/>Setting up border variables</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">Another CSS property that gets used often is borders. That makes it a great candidate for Sass variables. Insert the following code after the link colors in the file:</p><pre class="programlisting">$border-color: $grey; 
$border-size: 1px; 
$border-type: solid; 
$border-focus: $purple; 
</pre><p class="calibre7">Let me explain why I've set up the border variables in this manner:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">When you are deciding on a value for <code class="literal">$border-color</code>, you should pick a color that you think will get used the most often in your components. Something like <code class="literal">$grey</code> is always a safe bet in most designs.</li><li class="listitem">As with the color value, you should set the <code class="literal">$border-size</code> to the most common border size you anticipate using. It's also a good idea to set this to <code class="literal">1px</code> because you can easily do the math to apply a Sass operator if you want a thinner or thicker border.</li><li class="listitem">Again for the <code class="literal">$border-type</code>, set it to the value you will use the most, which is probably going to be solid.</li><li class="listitem">Finally, set up a common <code class="literal">$border-focus</code> color. This is primarily used in form inputs once they are active. It's a good idea to pick a contrasting color for this variable so it really stands out when the input is in focus.</li></ul></div><p class="calibre7">That concludes all the border variables I would recommend including. Next let's include some basic layout variables.</p></div></div>

<div class="book" title="Creating a collection of variables">
<div class="book" title="Adding variables for margin and padding"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_pb_8"><a id="ch08lvl2sec138" class="calibre1"/>Adding variables for margin and padding</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">For consistent spacing throughout your designs, it's a good idea to use variables for <code class="literal">margin</code> and <code class="literal">padding</code> so that you can standardize on size. These properties are also used often so it's smart to make them variables that can be reused. Add the following code after the border markup:</p><pre class="programlisting">$margin: 1em; 
$padding: 1em; 
</pre><p class="calibre7">All I'm doing here is setting a base size (for both <code class="literal">padding</code> and <code class="literal">margin</code>) <code class="literal">1em</code>. Again, it's a good idea to set both of these to <code class="literal">1em</code> because it is easy to do the math if you want to use Sass operators to increase or decrease the values of specific components. Those are the last variables that I would recommend adding to your variables file. However, we should add at least one mixin to the file before we are finished.</p></div></div>

<div class="book" title="Creating a collection of variables">
<div class="book" title="Adding mixins to the variables file"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_pb_9"><a id="ch08lvl2sec139" class="calibre1"/>Adding mixins to the variables file</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">Since mixins will also be used through a number of your components, you should define them in this variables file. Then they will be available to all the CSS code that follows them in the custom theme file. At the very least, I would recommend setting up a mixin for <code class="literal">border-radius</code>, which I will show you how to do next. You may also want to include additional mixins for other CSS3 features.</p></div></div>

<div class="book" title="Creating a collection of variables">

Insert the following code after the layout variables in your file:</p><pre class="programlisting">@mixin border-radius($radius) { 
  -webkit-border-radius: $radius; 
     -moz-border-radius: $radius; 
      -ms-border-radius: $radius; 
          border-radius: $radius; 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre7">In Less, it is possible to set a global value for all your <code class="literal">border-radius</code> in a mixin. However, with Sass you have to set up the above formula but then on the actual selectors that follow you have to set the actual <code class="literal">border-radius</code> value. An example of that would look like this:</p><pre class="programlisting">.my-component { 
  @include border-radius(5px); 
 } 
</pre><p class="calibre7">In this example, I've added the <code class="literal">border-radius</code> mixin to a CSS class called <code class="literal">.my-component</code>. The component will have a <code class="literal">border-radius</code> of <code class="literal">5px</code> applied to it. You will need to repeat this step on any CSS class or component where you want to apply the <code class="literal">border-radius</code> mixin. That concludes our variables Sass file. We went over a bunch of code there, so let's see what it all looks like together. I've also included some CSS comments in the following code to help remind you what each section does:</p><pre class="programlisting">/* variables */

} 
</pre><p class="calibre7">Now that we have all our variables and mixins set up, let's go ahead and start to learn how to apply them. We'll continue to build on the button example we started earlier by extending it into a custom look and feel.</p></div></div>

To get started, we'll build on the button component we started to work on earlier. In this next step we are going to expand on the CSS we have added to fully customize the component. What you want to do is overwrite all the CSS classes and properties that you want to change. In some cases, this might only be a few things but in other scenarios you may want to change quite a bit.</p></div>

The first thing we need to customize is the base <code class="literal">.btn</code> CSS class. Once we have applied some changes there, we'll add more CSS to control the look and feel of the different button variations. Insert the following CSS at the top of the file for the base button class:</p><pre class="programlisting">.btn { 
  background-color: $grey; 
  border-color: $grey; 
 
  @include border-radius(20px); 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre7">To keep things simple, I'm only going to overwrite a few properties. You're totally free to get more creative and change additional properties to make your buttons look different from the Bootstrap default link. Let's break down what I've done:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">First I've set the <code class="literal">background-color</code> and <code class="literal">border-color</code> to use the <code class="literal">$grey</code> from our color palette. This is a good time to point out that if you want to do a full theme you need to overwrite all the Bootstrap default colors on all components to match your color palette.</li><li class="listitem">Next I've inserted the <code class="literal">border-radius</code> mixin and given it a value of <code class="literal">20px</code>. This will make the buttons really rounded. I'm going for this look so you can clearly see that the button has been customized.</li></ul></div><p class="calibre7">Once you have saved these changes, go to the terminal and run the <code class="literal">harp compile</code> command from the root of the project directory. Then fire up the server and open the home page of the project that has a bunch of buttons on it. Your buttons should now look like this:</p><p class="calibre7">
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00118.jpeg" alt="Customizing the button component" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">
</p><p class="calibre7">Now that might not look too useful, but it's important that we customize the base <code class="literal">.btn</code> class first; now we'll continue building the component out by applying our color palette to all of the different button variations.</p></div></div>

<div class="book" title="Customizing components" id="2G3F81-d17423bd3b664255b5fd09e37e25e334">

Before we get to all the different button types, let's start by customizing the <code class="literal">.btn-primary</code> variation. Enter the following code in the <code class="literal">_buttons.scss</code> file after the base <code class="literal">.btn</code> styles:</p><pre class="programlisting">.btn-primary { 
   background-color: $purple; 
   border-color: $purple; 
} 
 
.btn-primary:hover, 
.btn-primary:active { 
   background-color: $purple2; 
   border-color: $purple2; 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre7">There are a few different things going on so let's review them all:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">There are two sections of CSS for each button variation. The first is the static state of the button. The second is the hover and active states of the button.</li><li class="listitem">For the static state we use the <code class="literal">.btn-primary</code> class and insert the <code class="literal">background-color</code> and <code class="literal">border-color</code> properties. I want to make my primary button purple so I've inserted the <code class="literal">$purple</code> Sass variable to overwrite the Bootstrap default color.</li><li class="listitem">For the other states, we have <code class="literal">.btn-primary:hover</code> and <code class="literal">.btn-primary:active</code>. In this case, I'm using the second purple color variable which is <code class="literal">$purple2</code>. On the hover or active button there will be a slightly darker shade of purple.</li></ul></div><p class="calibre7">Save the file, run a <code class="literal">harp compile</code> in the terminal, and then open up the home page in your browser. If everything was coded correctly, your buttons should now look like this:</p><p class="calibre7">
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00119.jpeg" alt="Extending the button component to use our color palette" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">
</p><p class="calibre7">As you can see, the primary button is now purple! It's as simple as that; you can start to apply a custom look and feel to the button component. Let's build out the rest of the button color variations by entering the following code into the <code class="literal">_buttons.scss</code> file:</p><pre class="programlisting">.btn-secondary { 
   background-color: $off-white; 
   border-color: $off-white; 
} 
 
.btn-secondary:hover, 
.btn-secondary:active { 
   background-color: $grey; 
   border-color: $grey; 
} 
 
.btn-success { 
   background-color: $green; 
   border-color: $green; 
} 
 
.btn-success:hover, 
.btn-success:active { 
   background-color: $green2; 
   border-color: $green2; 
} 
 
.btn-info { 
   background-color: $blue; 
   border-color: $blue; 
} 
 
.btn-info:hover, 
.btn-info:active { 
   background-color: $blue2; 
   border-color: $blue2; 
} 
 
.btn-warning { 
   background-color: $yellow; 
   border-color: $yellow; 
} 
 
.btn-warning:hover, 
.btn-warning:active { 
   background-color: $yellow2; 
   border-color: $yellow2; 
} 
 
.btn-danger { 
   background-color: $red; 
   border-color: $red; 
} 
 
.btn-danger:hover, 
.btn-danger:active { 
   background-color: $red2; 
   border-color: $red2; 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre7">That's a bunch of code but it should be fairly easy to understand. I've simply followed the same steps I completed for the primary button for every other button variation. Along the way, I've replaced the default Bootstrap color values with our custom color palette. Once you're done, all of your buttons should now look like this:</p><p class="calibre7">
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00120.jpeg" alt="Extending the button component to use our color palette" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">
</p><p class="calibre7">We've now successfully customized the entire button component. As I mentioned earlier, there may be additional things you might want to do to the buttons. However, at the very least, we've done enough to show how you can make the component your own. The next step in this process is to go through every Bootstrap component one by one and apply the same customization process. We call this writing your own Bootstrap theme.</p></div></div>

<div class="book" title="Writing a theme"><div class="book" id="2H1VQ2-d17423bd3b664255b5fd09e37e25e334"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch08lvl1sec67" class="calibre1"/>Writing a theme</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">Creating your own Bootstrap theme is a bit of an undertaking. The good news is that once you've done it you can reuse a ton of the code for future themes. That's where the real power in making your code modular comes into play. Instead of starting over from scratch each time, you can reuse old code and just extend it. In the last section, we learned how to customize the button component that was the start of our own theme. Let's first start by looking at some common Bootstrap components that you'll want to customize for your own themes.</p></div>

<div class="book" title="Writing a theme">
<div class="book" title="Common components that need to be customized"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_pb_1"><a id="ch08lvl2sec143" class="calibre1"/>Common components that need to be customized</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">There are many ways that you can theme Bootstrap. In some cases, you may only need to customize a few components to get a unique look and feel going. However, you may want to do a more thorough theming process so that your theme doesn't resemble the default Bootstrap look at all. In this section, let's start by listing some of the common components you will most likely want to customize.</p><p class="calibre7">Next we'll go through the process of writing the code to customize a few so you get an idea as to how it works. Here's a list of components that I would recommend customizing:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Buttons</li><li class="listitem">Drop-downs</li><li class="listitem">Alerts</li><li class="listitem">Navbar</li><li class="listitem">Typography</li><li class="listitem">Tables</li></ul></div><p class="calibre7">This list is just a starting place. If you want to create a unique theme, you should really try to customize all Bootstrap components. At the very least, you should change them to use your custom color palette, typography, and layout styles. We've already covered buttons so let's jump into customizing the drop-down component, which is an extension of the button.</p></div></div>

<div class="book" title="Writing a theme">
<div class="book" title="Theming the drop-down component"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_pb_2"><a id="ch08lvl2sec144" class="calibre1"/>Theming the drop-down component</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">The drop-down component requires a medium-sized amount of customization so it's a good starting place to get an idea of what is involved in this process. It also builds on the code we wrote for the button so it's a natural second step. It's important to note that some components will require a good amount of CSS to customize them, while others will only need a little bit. Let's start by creating a new Sass file for drop-downs. From your project folder, create a new file called <code class="literal">_dropdown.scss</code> in the <code class="literal">css/components</code> directory. You can leave the file blank for now, just save it.</p><p class="calibre7">Once you've created the new Sass file for the drop-down component, we need to import it into our main theme is called <code class="literal">custom.scss</code>. Open up the custom style sheet in your text editor and insert the following line of code after the <code class="literal">@import</code> for the button component:</p><pre class="programlisting">@import "components/_dropdown.scss"; 
</pre><p class="calibre7">Now we are ready to start coding our custom drop-down styles. Open up <code class="literal">_dropdown.scss</code> in your text editor and let's insert this first section of CSS:</p><pre class="programlisting">.dropdown-menu { 
   color: $primary-text; 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre7">As with the buttons in the previous section, I'm only going to change the most basic properties to demonstrate how you can customize the component. Feel free to customize additional properties to get a more unique look and feel.</p><p class="calibre7">Let's break down what is happening here. The drop-down component is made up of the base <code class="literal">.dropdown-menu</code> CSS class. This controls how the menu will look. Here I've simply changed the text color to use for the <code class="literal">$primary-text</code> variable.</p><p class="calibre7">We also need to do some work on the list of links that appear in our drop-down menu. Insert the following CSS after the first section you just entered:</p><pre class="programlisting">.dropdown-item:focus, 
.dropdown-item:hover { 
   color: $primary-text; 
   background-color: $secondary-background; 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre7">Let me break down what is happening here:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">These CSS classes control the hover and focus states for each list item in our drop-down menu. Again, I've set it to use our <code class="literal">$primary-text</code> font color.</li><li class="listitem">When you hover on a list item, the background color changes. I've changed that background color to use our <code class="literal">$secondary-background</code> color variable. In this case you should use the background color variable, not a customized color variable. The reason for this is it's easier to keep track of what background colors you are using as you progress through the writing of your code.</li></ul></div><p class="calibre7">The last thing we need to do is update the actual drop-down button trigger with some additional code. Enter the last part of CSS into the file:</p><pre class="programlisting">.open &gt; .btn-primary.dropdown-toggle:focus { 
   background-color: $purple2; 
   border-color: $purple2; 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre7">When the drop-down button trigger is clicked the <code class="literal">.open</code> CSS class will dynamically be inserted into the HTML code. This initiates a unique variation on the button class, a drop-down toggle focus. That may sound complicated but what you need to know is that you need to set this selector to our <code class="literal">$purple2</code> color so it matches the rest of the button.</p><p class="calibre7">I've overwritten the <code class="literal">background-color</code> and <code class="literal">border-color</code> properties to use <code class="literal">$purple2</code> from our color palette.</p><p class="calibre7">That's it, the drop-down component has now been themed to match our look and feel. If you preview it in the browser it should look like this when the menu is open:</p><p class="calibre7">
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00121.jpeg" alt="Theming the drop-down component" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">
</p><p class="calibre7">Now that we've finished with the drop-down component let's move on to learning how to theme the alerts component.</p></div></div>

<div class="book" title="Writing a theme">
<div class="book" title="Customizing the alerts component"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_pb_3"><a id="ch08lvl2sec145" class="calibre1"/>Customizing the alerts component</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">The alerts component in Bootstrap is fairly easy to theme. As with the button component, it comes in a few variations. Let's start by coding up the CSS for the default color method. Create a new file called <code class="literal">_alerts.scss</code> and save it to the <code class="literal">css/components</code> directory. Don't forget to import it into <code class="literal">custom.scss</code> with the following line of code:</p><pre class="programlisting">@import "components/_alerts.scss"; 
</pre><p class="calibre7">Once you've set up the file, let's get started with the code for the success alert component:</p><pre class="programlisting">.alert-success { 
   color: $green; 
   background-color: lighten( $green, 30% ); 
   border-color: lighten( $green, 30% ); 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre7">What you're now seeing should start to look familiar. However, I have introduced something new that I need to explain:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">This is the success alert so it should be green in color. The first thing I've done is change the text color to use the green from our palette with the <code class="literal">$green</code> variable.</li><li class="listitem">For the <code class="literal">background-color</code> and <code class="literal">border-color</code> properties, I'm using something new, a Sass function. In this case, I want a green color that is slightly lighter than my text. Instead of introducing another green color variable, I can use a Sass function to lighten the base <code class="literal">$green</code> variable color.</li><li class="listitem">To create the function, you use the <code class="literal">lighten</code> keyword. Inside the brackets you need to include the variable name you want to target, in this case <code class="literal">$green</code>, and finally include a percentage value for how much to lighten it by. This is a nice little trick to save you having to create more variables.</li></ul></div><p class="calibre7">Once you code this up it should look like this in the browser:</p><p class="calibre7">
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00122.jpeg" alt="Customizing the alerts component" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">
</p><p class="calibre7">As you can see, we are using the green color values from our color palette. Let's continue and customize the colors for the rest of the alert bar variations. Enter the following code into the <code class="literal">_alerts.scss</code> file:</p><pre class="programlisting">.alert-info { 
   color: $blue; 
   background-color: lighten( $blue, 30% ); 
   border-color: lighten( $blue, 30% ); 
} 
 
.alert-warning { 
   color: $yellow; 
   background-color: lighten( $yellow, 30% ); 
   border-color: lighten( $yellow, 30% ); 
} 
 
.alert-danger { 
   color: $red; 
   background-color: lighten( $red, 30% ); 
   border-color: lighten( $red, 30% ); 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre7">The other alerts follow the same pattern as the success version. They should look like this in the browser when you are done:</p><p class="calibre7">
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00123.jpeg" alt="Customizing the alerts component" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">
</p><p class="calibre7">As you can see, the alerts are now using our color palette. Let's move on to the last component that I will show you how to customize, which is typography.</p></div></div>

<div class="book" title="Customizing the typography component"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title2" id="calibre_pb_4"><a id="ch08lvl2sec146" class="calibre1"/>Customizing the typography component</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">The typography component isn't difficult to customize. We'll build off the base variables we set up to apply them to the appropriate HTML tags. As we did with our other components, start with creating a new file called <code class="literal">_typography.scss</code> and save it to the <code class="literal">css/components</code> directory. Once you do this, import the file into <code class="literal">custom.scss</code> with the following line of code:</p><pre class="programlisting">@import "components/_typography.scss"; 
</pre><p class="calibre7">Let's start customizing the type by applying some styles to the base header tags:</p><pre class="programlisting">h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 { 
   font-family: $heading-copy; 
   color: $primary-text; 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre7">Here I've simply used the <code class="literal">$heading-copy</code> variable and applied it to all the HTML heading tags. This will allow our custom heading typeface to be used for all headers. I've also added the <code class="literal">$primary-text</code> variable so that our headers are using the correct text color. Next let's take a look at a few miscellaneous text styles that you will likely want to overwrite:</p><pre class="programlisting">small { 
   color: $light-text; 
} 
 
pre { 
   color: $pre-text; 
} 
 
code { 
   color: $code-text; 
} 
</pre><p class="calibre7">As we did with our base variables, I'm now applying some of them on actual selectors. Let's break it down:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">For the <code class="literal">&lt;small&gt;</code> HTML tag, I want it to look more subtle so I've set the text color to use the <code class="literal">$light-text</code> variable.</li><li class="listitem">I purposely set up color text variables for the HTML <code class="literal">&lt;pre&gt;</code> and <code class="literal">&lt;code&gt;</code> tags. I've now applied the <code class="literal">$pre-text</code> and <code class="literal">$code-text</code> variables to these tags.</li></ul></div><p class="calibre7">That covers some of the basic typography styles you're going to want to customize. There are more you could add but I will let you explore these on your own. That also goes for all the Bootstrap components. We have only scratched the surface of the level of customizing you can do for your Bootstrap theme. However, I think I've given you a good introduction to what you need to do for coding your own Bootstrap themes.</p></div></div>
