- en: The first step in creating an intranet, beyond answering the question of who
    the users will be, is to determine its structure. The structure of the intranet
    is often a derivative of the organizational structure of the company or institution.
    Liferay Portal CMS provides several tools that allow mapping of a company's structure
    in the system. The hierarchy is built by organizations that match functional or
    localization departments of the company. Each organization represents one department
    or localization and assembles users who represent employees of these departments.
    However, sometimes, there are other groups of employees in the company. These
    groups exist beyond the company's organizational structure, and can be reflected
    in the system by the User Groups functionality.

    folders on a computer drive. An organization may have its suborganizations and—except
    the first level organization—at the same time, it can be a suborganization of
    another one. This folder-similar mechanism allows you to create a tree structure
    of organizations.

    company. The company's headquarter is located in London. There are also two other
    offices in Liverpool and Glasgow. The company is divided into finance, marketing,
    sales, IT, human resources, and legal departments. Employees from Glasgow and
    Liverpool belong to the IT department.

    The regular organization provides the possibility to create a multilevel structure,

    one exception: the top-level organization cannot have any parent organizations).
    The localization is a special kind of organization that allows us to provide some
    additional data, such as country and region. However, it does not enable us to
    create suborganizations. When creating the tree of organizations, it is possible
    to combine regular organizations and locations, where, for instance, the top-level
    organization will be the regular organization and, both locations and regular
    organizations will be used as child organizations.'

    the requirements, as seen in [Chapter 2](part0020.xhtml#aid-J2B81 "Chapter 2. Authentication
    and Registration Process"), *Authentication and Registration Process*. The first
    way is to enable users by creating their own accounts via the **Create Account**
    form. This functionality allows all users who can enter the site containing the
    form to register and gain access to the designated content of the website. In
    this case, the system automatically assigns the default user account parameters,
    which indicate the range of activities that may be carried by them in the system.
    The second solution (which we presented in this recipe) is to reserve the users'
    account creation to the administrators, who will decide what parameters should

    to its members, for instance, messages sent by the Announcements portlet. A user
    becomes a member of the group when they are assigned to it. This assignment can
    be done by editing the user account that has already been created (see the *User
    attributes* description in *Adding a new user* recipe) or using the **Assign Members**
    action from the **User Groups** actions menu. In this recipe, we will show you
