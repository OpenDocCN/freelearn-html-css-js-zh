<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">Millions of people visit millions of websites every day. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">Some to play games, some to see what’s going on in the world, others to let us know what they’re up to (and what their cats are up to!), and others to have conversations with the world on all sorts of topics. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">Banking, medicine, agriculture, society, parenting, exercise, food, and culture – virtually every industry and every interest you can think of has representation in this giant maze </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">of websites.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">But who makes these digital places we all (virtually) hang out in now? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">Who manipulates the technology that underpins it all to create the next great website? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.3">Well, if you are here reading this book, then guess what? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.4">You’ve taken your first step toward the answer </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">being </span></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">you</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">!</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">Make no mistake: this book will not teach you everything you need to know on a technical level – a single book could never do that – but by the time you reach the end, you’ll have the start of that knowledge in your brain, and you’ll have a clear picture of the next hill you </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">should climb.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">In this chapter, the essential goal is to give you an understanding of what a web developer is and what it takes to be one. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.2">Understanding this is, of course, key to your entire journey, because it wouldn’t make much sense to pursue a career you didn’t truly understand, would it? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.3">And, especially in a field where there can be a wide variety of definitions even for seemingly simple things, it’s important to have that </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.16.1">foundational knowledge.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.17.1">So, in this chapter, we will cover the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.18.1">following topics:</span></span></p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-17"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">What even IS a web developer?!</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">When we ask the question “What is a web developer?” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.2">the obvious answer is someone who develops websites. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.3">But that </span><a id="_idIndexMarker000"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">answer is reductive and it doesn’t really begin to cover it all. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">Also, there really is no single, accepted definition, but there are many variations on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">the theme.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">If you were to ask me – and you kind of have done, by reading this book! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">– my answer would be that a web developer is a programmer, a coder, or a software developer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.3">All these terms are basically interchangeable, and they simply refer to someone who creates computer software, of which a website is </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">a type.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">The one true unifying principle, whether we’re talking about web development or another type of software development, is that you must be able to think logically, which translates to being able to write instructions (AKA code) that the computer will follow in order to produce a website in a web browser. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">Basically, web development is a form of software </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">engineering</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">, though not all software engineering is web development (because not all software runs on the web) – so, you’re really on a journey to becoming a software engineer, one whose software just so happens to run on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">the web.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">But it’s not all about writing code! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">A web developer also has to be a graphic artist. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.3">They have to be a usability expert. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.4">They have to be a business analyst. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.5">They have to be a writer and a copy editor. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.6">They have to be network engineers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.7">And they have to be so much more. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.8">They must be a jack of all trades, in other words. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.9">The job is not just writing code; there’s much more to it, and we’ll get into it all as we </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">move forward.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">This brings up a point that you will sometimes hear from those not as familiar with what’s involved in being a web developer: they say that web development is somehow </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">easier</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1"> than other kinds of software development. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.2">Well, let me dissuade you from that notion right now because it couldn’t be further from the truth. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.3">In fact, while it certainly isn’t true all the time, a strong argument can be made that web development is frequently </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">harder</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1"> than non-web development, just because of all that‘s involved, some of which is unique to web development (or, at least, is of larger concern than in non-web development). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">Here, I’m referring to things such as networking, since the web inherently operates over networks whereas not all software does, and the fact that in web development, you as the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker001"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1"> developer aren’t really in control of the runtime environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">For example, a user can resize their browser window however they want or change the zoom or font of a web page, and your code has to adapt and handle those decisions (this can be true to some extent in desktop development too, but it’s a </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">much</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1"> larger concern in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">web development).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">With all that said, let me assuage any fear that might be rising in your mind: while there is indeed a lot to learn, the simple fact is that web development starts from some relatively basic concepts and builds from there. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.2">Plus, there is absolutely no need to learn everything all at once. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.3">No, you can be an exceptionally good web developer without knowing everything you “need” to learn at any given moment in time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.4">This is a field where </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">learning to learn</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1"> is a key requirement, and being able to learn as you go and figure things out piece by piece is critical. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.2">In truth, there is simply no way one person ever </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">could</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1"> know everything out there, a fact you will understand quite well by the time you finish this book. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.2">In other words: you </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">will</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1"> get there, no matter how daunting it may seem, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">I promise!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">Let‘s go a little bit deeper in terms of what it means to be a web developer and what it looks like from a process perspective to build a website, at least at a very </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">high level.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">Digging deeper into being a web developer and building websites</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">In general, it all starts with </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">stakeholders</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1"> or clients – essentially, the people you are creating a website for. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.2">Of </span><a id="_idIndexMarker002"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">course, that stakeholder could </span><a id="_idIndexMarker003"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">also be you yourself. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.2">Either way, someone somewhere has some idea for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">a website.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">This website could be what we call a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">brochureware</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1"> site (or “brochure website”), which is a site that is more or less just </span><a id="_idIndexMarker004"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">static (unchanging) content. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.2">Have you ever checked out the website for your favorite local pizza joint? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.3">Chances are, it isn’t much more than some information about the restaurant, a menu, and some contact information to use to place an order (some will have online ordering, of course, but let’s assume your local place isn’t fancy enough to have that). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.4">Sites such as that would generally be considered brochureware because they, in a sense, are a digital version of a company’s marketing brochure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.5">They, for the most part, aren’t interactive; their goal is simply to convey information </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">to you.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">My own</span><a id="_idIndexMarker005"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1"> personal website at </span><a href="http://zammetti.com"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">zammetti.com</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">, as shown in </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">Figure 1</span></em></span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1">.1</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">, would be an example of such a brochureware site. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.2">It doesn’t do much other than convey information about me, and that’s </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">the point:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">However, the client might instead have a grand idea for the next Twitter (or X, as it’s known these days), or maybe Gmail or Bing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.2">These are vastly different from brochureware sites in the sense that they are highly interactive, meaning they perform functions for their visitors. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.3">They are meant to get things done. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.4">These types of websites are generally referred </span><a id="_idIndexMarker006"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">to as </span><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">web apps</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">It’s a subtle difference, and the line between them can get very blurry. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">But as a general guideline, if a website is very interactive and can perform functions at the user’s behest, then chances are, it’s a web app. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.3">Saying that, it’s important to remember that a web app is still </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">a website.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">Either way, the stakeholder has that vision, and your first job as a web developer is to listen to them and gain an understanding of what they’re trying to achieve. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.2">That may sound easy, but trust me, it’s not always the case! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.3">Often, the idea will be very vague, and/or they won’t be able to express it clearly, and they’ll be counting on you to interpret their words. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.4">In </span><a id="_idIndexMarker007"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">essence, you need to figure out what’s in their heads when, sometimes, even they don’t </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">really know!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">You will need to then take that understanding and map it to a technical solution – that is, actually build a website. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.2">This process will very often be iterative, meaning you’ll build something, show it to the stakeholder, get feedback, and then make changes, going through that cycle several times. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.3">This is very typical and there is absolutely nothing wrong with it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.4">I would go so far as to say that </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">not</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1"> doing that will be the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">rare exception.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">But what do you actually </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">build</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1"> at that point? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.2">Well, it may surprise you to learn that, very often, you won’t be writing any code or doing any programming straight away. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.3">Instead, the first step is often to create what we call “low-fidelity mock-ups.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.4">Or, to put it more </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1">simply: drawings!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">If you’re an artistic type, you might draw these by hand, but if you’re like me – someone who couldn’t draw a straight line to save his life – you’ll seek out tools built expressly for this purpose. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.2">There are many options here, such as Canva and Figma. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.3">Even Adobe Photoshop – a graphics editing program – is often used for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">this purpose.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">Another tool that is quite popular, which happens to be my favorite, is Balsamiq Wireframes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.2">With it, you can produce illustrations such as what you see in </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">Figure 1</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">.2</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">Notice how in that mock-up – which is what we call this kind of low-fidelity diagram – things aren’t quite lined up, and there’s no actual text in the middle there, just some filler to say that text </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1">will</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1"> be there? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.2">At this point, you really aren’t concerned with things such as colors, layout, font choices, detailed text, graphics, and other things that make a website complete. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.3">All you’re trying to do is nail down the overall structure, make sure you understand what the client </span><a id="_idIndexMarker008"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">wants at a high level, and show it in a form they can understand, so they can reply with “Yes, you got it!” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.2">or “Nope, back to the drawing board” (though you’re hoping for something in-between, such as “Okay, it’s close, we just need to tweak these one or two fairly </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">minor things”).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">The next phase is usually prototyping, sometimes called proof of concept (though that tends to only apply to interactive sites since the idea is to prove out functionality). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.2">This normally will involve actual development and actual programming, but done in a very quick-and-dirty way. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.3">In fact, it will often be the case that you will throw away some percentage of the work that you do in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">this phase.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1">You still aren’t necessarily going for perfection here, but for sure, you need to get into more of the details. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.2">For example, what should be seen when the user clicks the “Order form here” button? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.3">At the mock-up stage, you might hand a second mock-up diagram to the client that doesn’t say much more than “the order form will appear when the button is clicked.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.4">But, at the prototype stage, you’ll need to build that order form screen to some degree. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.5">It </span><a id="_idIndexMarker009"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">still doesn’t need to be 100% complete in terms of styling or functionality, but you have to </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">begin</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1"> to make an actual order form and make it </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">begin</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1"> to look and </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">appear</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1"> to work as it will </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">for real.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">In this phase, user interactions are typically “dummied up,” meaning that they’re faked, but in a way that makes them look real to the client so they can get a feel for how things will work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.2">If you need to be able to add pizza and other food items to a shopping cart, for example, there are ways to build that quickly and cheaply, ways that will let the client actually experience the ordering process, but without investing all the time and effort into truly building that functionality for real, which takes much more time </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">and effort.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">Once they get their hands on it – and you will most probably go through a few more cycles of iteration – only then is it time to get down to building the website for real. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.2">This is the point where you’ll start </span><a id="_idIndexMarker010"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">writing code that actually works in its true, final form. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.2">You’ll need to start gathering graphics, possibly creating them from scratch, and getting the layout solid in terms of alignment, colors, fonts, and all the styling that goes into a web page. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.3">You’ll need to write the code for things such as order forms to make them really work, which may or may not include writing code on the server as well (we’ll get into that more later). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.4">All of the ideas that went into the mock-ups and the prototype in a rough form just to express the ideas to the stakeholders now have to be solidified into a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">real product.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">It’s quite an adventure to go from an idea, sometimes a very nebulous idea, to a full-blown website, whether it’s a brochureware site or a full-fledged web app. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.2">It takes a lot of time, a lot of patience sometimes, and an ability to fine-tune things little by little. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.3">You’re molding clay into a beautiful vase, in essence. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.4">It’s not always easy; sometimes the tower of clay even collapses and you have to start again, but that’s the job of a web developer, in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">a nutshell!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">At this point, I want to once more reiterate my earlier point that while this may all seem overwhelming, you shouldn’t fear it! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.2">We’ll take one step after another together and build the foundation you need. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.3">All we’re doing here is looking at things from 10,000 feet up and there is no expectation that you know everything, and that will pretty much always be the case as you work in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">this field.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">That said, I’m hoping you </span><a id="_idIndexMarker011"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">think that all sounds pretty interesting! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.2">But being interesting is just one part of it – what about the job market? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.3">Are web developers actually in demand? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.4">Well, let’s </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">find out!</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">How in demand are web developers?</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1">If you go online these days, you’ll see some </span><a id="_idIndexMarker012"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">debate about whether web development – and indeed software development more generally – is in danger. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.2">So, are we still in demand? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.3">Will we continue to be, once artificial intelligence has its way with us? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.4">Will ChatGPT and its competitors do what we do in a fraction of the time and for a fraction of the cost? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.5">There’s a lot of doom and gloom going on along those lines for sure, so it’s a legitimate question </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">to ask.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">We can certainly debate that question all day long, and plenty of people do. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.2">If you want my opinion, it’s simple: AI isn’t going to take our jobs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.3">What it </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">will</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1"> do, though, is be an indispensable tool that all web developers will </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">have</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1"> to use. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.2">But I’m getting ahead of myself here, and we’ll be talking about AI tools later in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">this book.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">For now, the simple answer is that yes, web developers are absolutely in demand right now, and I don’t think there’s much danger of that changing over the next 10-20 years at least (probably even a lot longer than that). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.2">The job will morph a bit over time for sure, just because software development always does anyway (it’s an extremely rapidly changing field), but if you’re willing to keep up, I don’t think you need to be worried about not being </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1">in demand.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">In fact, if you want some hard figures to back that assertion up, have a look at </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1">Figure 1</span></em></span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1">.3</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.1">, which is a screenshot of the U.S. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.2">Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Occupational Outlook Handbook page discussing </span><a id="_idIndexMarker013"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.1">we</span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/web-developers.htm"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1">b </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">developers (</span></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/web-</span></span></a><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">developers.htm</span></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">):</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">What you’ll find on the BLS site is that the employment opportunities for web developers are projected to grow by 16% between 2022 and 2032 (as of writing – the number could change by the time you read this). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.2">What’s interesting is that the projected growth was 13% two years ago, so this tells us that demand is </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1">increasing</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">, which is great news for anyone entering the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker014"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1"> field. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.2">In fact, that projected growth outpaces virtually every other field </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">there is.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1">So, yeah, to say we’re in demand is probably </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1">an understatement!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">This demand is fueled primarily by e-commerce sites and mobile development. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.2">What </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1">are those?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.1">Well, an </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">e-commerce site</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1">, where </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1">e</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1"> is short for </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1">electronic</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">, is a </span><a id="_idIndexMarker015"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1">website where people buy and sell stuff or do other things that are generally considered “commerce.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.2">Amazon and eBay may be the most well-known e-commerce sites, but your bank’s website is also one, and even that local pizza joint’s site you looked at earlier might be. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.3">An e-commerce site is generally more about </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.1">conducting</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1"> business, so the pizza place’s website would be an e-commerce site if you can order food from it; however, if it’s just talking about the restaurant, then it’s probably a brochureware site (the dividing line can be blurry sometimes). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.2">Either way, since commerce is all about businesses, and businesses kind of rule the world (whether that’s a good thing or not), you can see why the demand is </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.1">only increasing.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.1">It’s not </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.1">only</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.1"> about e-commerce sites, of course. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.2">Social media is another huge category where there is plenty of work to be found, and there are of course many other categories of websites. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.3">But regardless of the type of site it is, it very often comes down to businesses behind them, or other types of organizations (non-profits, governments, etc.). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.4">As these entities continue to prioritize their online presence over non-internet presence (because people now expect to conduct their lives on the internet by and large), that demand trend line will just continue to go up </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.1">and up.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.1">Mobile development is a whole other category, but the fact is that a lot of mobile development these days is also web development. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.2">You know the apps you run on your iPhone or Samsung Galaxy phone? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.3">Many of them are what we call “native” apps, meaning they are programmed to run on those specific platforms. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.4">However many of them use the same web technologies as are used to build websites, and that trend is likely to grow. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.5">Creating websites, or web apps, for mobile devices comes with unique challenges, but the skillset is the same, so growth there means growth in web development </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.1">as well.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.1">In fact, for much of the world, websites are more frequently accessed with mobile devices than typical desktop machines (and laptops are a little bit of a gray area, though they tend to be more like desktop machines than mobile smartphones). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.2">Web development is often done in a “mobile first” way, meaning you make your website look and function correctly on a smartphone and then tweak it to also work well on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.1">a desktop.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.1">One thing you can see from this discussion is that web development comes in many forms, making it an expansive</span><a id="_idIndexMarker016"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.1"> topic that’s only becoming more so over time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.2">Many different disciplines are required of you as a web developer, including things such as cloud computing, cybersecurity, data analytics, search engine optimization, and much more. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.3">If you don’t know what any of this means, don’t worry – you will by the end of this book! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.4">The relevant point here, though, is that skilled web developers are becoming more valuable due to this ever-growing list of things you have to know at least </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.1">something</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.1"> about. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.2">Once you’ve acquired those skills, the demand for you to put them to use for someone will only grow because the ever-evolving nature of the field means your ability to learn – and being able to demonstrate that – will be your most </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">valuable asset.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor020"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.1">Show me the money!</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">Okay, great, I’ve convinced you that web developers are in demand and will continue to stay in demand, and we’ll probably even see that demand grow. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.2">But it also sounds kind of </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">hard</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">, doesn’t it? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.2">It had better be worth </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">it, right?!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1">Well, it is! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.2">According to that same BLS site I mentioned earlier, the median income as of May 2022 was $78,580. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.3">And I can tell you that this number is higher than it was in 2020, and it was going up for a long time before then. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.4">That </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.1">ain’t bad!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.1">But it gets better! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.2">As you progress and gain experience, you won’t be at all surprised to learn that your earning potential goes up. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.3">I’ll give you a very rough progression you might see in your career based on your number of years </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1">of experience:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">You might start off in the $50,000-$60,000 range (though remember that all these numbers are impacted by a lot of factors, so your starting salary may be lower or indeed higher </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">in reality)</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1">After three years, you can likely expect to be making in the $</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.1">70,000-$80,000 range</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.1">After five years, you’ll very likely be at or </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.1">near $100,000</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.1">By the 10-year mark, you’ll almost certainly be above $100,000, probably more in the $130,000-$140,000 range, and you’ll most likely be about to, or already have, moved into a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.1">senior/lead role</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.1">After 15 years, you’re probably looking at $150,000 </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.1">or higher</span></span></li>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.1">But is a job in web development right for you?</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.1">Have you by chance ever heard of the mantra that “anyone can code”? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.2">It’s something we like to say, and in a basic sense, it </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.1">is</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.1"> true. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.2">There isn’t anything fundamentally unlearnable in the web development field for someone who is motivated to learn. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.3">It’s not like baseball where you have to be able to hit a 95mph fastball, or like basketball where you have to be able to make a jump shot, both of which take a lot of physical skill. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.4">And it’s not like being an astronaut where you must have perfect vision and nerves of steel to climb on and ride a giant, exploding candle into orbit! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.5">No, there aren’t any real physical requirements, natural-born talents, or innate abilities you need to possess. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.6">You can learn all you need to if you have </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.1">the drive.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.1">Let’s look at some of the key characteristics a web developer will tend to need to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.1">be successful.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-22"><a id="_idTextAnchor022"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.1">You gotta be a puzzle master</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.1">That being said, web </span><a id="_idIndexMarker019"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.1">development – and software development in general – is, in a sense, a constant exercise in puzzles. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.2">Everything you do will revolve around solving problems. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.3">How do you get the client’s logo to appear on the web page properly? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.4">How do you make their contact form send an email? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.5">How do you make the website accessible to those with disabilities? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.6">These are all problems to be solved, puzzles to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.1">be completed.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.1">Those who tend to thrive in this field have certain qualities, some inherent, but most of which can be developed over time </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.1">with experience.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-23"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.1">Creativity to the max</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.1">In web development, there’s also a large degree of creativity involved. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.2">There are rarely right or wrong ways to do things, rarely definitive approaches to solving problems, and rarely canonically correct answers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.3">So, you will often have to have a creative streak in you to produce pleasing results. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.4">You’ll have to take what’s asked of you – which may be fairly general and not clearly defined sometimes – and figure out how to make it a reality, often by introducing your own creative interpretation </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.1">of it.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.1">And it’s not just about what you see on the screen, where the idea of creativity and even artistry is more obviously applicable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.2">No, there is also creativity and artistry in writing </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.1">code</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.1">: how do you structure it? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.2">What components do you need and how do you make them interact with </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.1">each other?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.1">But while web development is a creative endeavor where you have a lot of freedom to do things your way, it’s not total anarchy! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.2">There are what we call “best practices,” which refer to solutions that have previously been applied in specific situations and have usually resulted in positive outcomes for many people. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.3">But at the end of the day, building websites is different from constructing a bridge, for example, because society has built lots of bridges, and as a result, we know how to do so every time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.4">We know what works and what doesn’t, and so we follow tried-and-true architectural techniques when building them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.5">While best practices give us </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.1">some</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.1"> of that in web development, it tends to be a lot less than you might think, and that opens the door for a lot </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.1">of creativity.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.1">To put it another way: while</span><a id="_idIndexMarker020"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.1"> building a bridge is surely part science and part art, in most cases, the science part will be the bigger part. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.2">In software development, and web development for sure, the opposite will usually be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.1">the case.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.1">So, a web developer must like solving problems, and they must be creative. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.2">They must also have solid attention to detail. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.3">Trust me when I tell you that there will be times when you’ll pull your hair out trying to make something work only to discover it wasn’t working because of one bad number or letter or symbol somewhere. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.4">The closer attention you pay to details, the longer it’ll take for you to go bald from pulling all your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.1">hair out!</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.1">You’ll hear this repeatedly, but learning to learn, and being comfortable with change, is one of the top skills you’ll need to master to be a web developer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.2">This field changes at a rate that is equal parts astounding, exciting… and massively frustrating! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.3">Just when you learn a skill and feel confident with it, it may fall out of favor and be replaced by </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.1">something else.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.1">This leads to a problem called “imposter syndrome,” and it’s something virtually everyone deals with. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.2">This is where</span><a id="_idIndexMarker021"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.1"> you feel like an imposter, someone who doesn’t know what they’re doing, even when you do. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.2">Despite how long I’ve been doing this kind of work, it still hits me sometimes too. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.3">The constant churn of technologies gives rise to this feeling because you’re constantly in a state of having to confront new things. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.4">There’s no silver bullet to deal with imposter syndrome, unfortunately. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.5">But being able to learn on-the-fly, and proving to yourself that you can over time, is about the only way to blunt its </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.1">effects somewhat.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.1">Keeping up with the changes in the field is a full-time job unto itself sometimes, and it definitely helps if you enjoy the discovery process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.2">If you’re someone who likes learning new things and likes being out on the ragged edge sometimes, then web development will probably make you smile </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.1">a lot.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.1">You have to have a thick skin to be a web developer because there will always be someone with an opinion you have to listen to and act upon. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.2">Whether that’s a client or a boss, you’ve got to be open to feedback, not take it personally, and be willing to revise your work based on what you hear. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.3">As writers like to say: you have to be willing to kill your babies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.4">In web development, that might mean that as cool as </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.1">you</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.1"> think the website you built looks, if the client feels otherwise, you’ve got to be willing to throw it away and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.1">start over.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-28"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.1">Finding what you need</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.1">A good chunk of your time as a web developer will be spent doing things that aren’t, seemingly, web development. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.2">Sure, I’ve talked about things such as communicating with others, but here, I’m talking about research and just conceptualizing things that you’ll be building, be that the layout of a</span><a id="_idIndexMarker022"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.1"> web page, the code behind it, and so on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.2">You’d be surprised how much time web developers spend just kind of staring off into space, visualizing things! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.3">But, beyond that, you have to be able to find information and synthesize it into your thinking. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.4">You have to know where to go to get answers to all the questions you’re absolutely going </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.1">to have.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.1">Do you know how to center a </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.1">div</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.1"> horizontally and vertically on a web page? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.2">Do you know what those words mean? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.3">No? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.4">Well, you’d better know where to go to find out! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.5">Do you know what the function signature for the React </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.1">useEffect()</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.1"> function is? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.2">No? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.3">I hope you can find out or you’ll be in trouble! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.4">Do you have to use Vue today – which you don’t know anything about – instead of React, which you normally use? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.5">Great – you’re gonna have some research to do, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.1">aren’t you?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.1">The point of all of this is that being a web developer means having to have a lot of skills and qualities beyond just pure technical knowledge. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.2">Truly, technical skills are the easy part. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.3">If you don’t relish the challenge of all of this then the web development field might not be a good fit for you. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.4">You have to embrace the challenge, embrace the madness! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.5">If you do that, I think that, putting money aside, you’ll get a lot of enjoyment out of the feeling of accomplishment you can get from it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.6">There’s nothing quite like the feeling of solving some problem that has been vexing you for a while and seeing something on the screen finally work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.7">It’s gratifying. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.8">Even if what you’re building doesn’t fundamentally interest you, seeing it work for the first time feels pretty </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.1">darn good!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.1">So, there is definitely reward in this field beyond the financial, but I think it’s only fair that you know what you’re getting into. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.2">There will be days where you’ll be screaming and yelling at inanimate objects for sure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.3">You’ll feel that imposter syndrome kick in all the time and have to fight it off. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.4">Almost every day will introduce some new thing you have to take in and make use of. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.5">But if</span><a id="_idIndexMarker023"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.1"> this is a challenge that excites you, then web development might be just the ticket </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.1">for you!</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor029"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.292.1">Being patient and handling failure</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.293.1">Two other skills, so to speak, that you’ll need to be a web developer are the ability to be patient and to handle failure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.293.2">You’ll need patience to research things and learn things, that’s obvious, but you’ll also need patience when building a website because it takes time to get all the details right. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.293.3">You’ll often have to go over things many times, tweaking them little by little, to get them </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.294.1">just right.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.295.1">That dovetails into the notion of handling failure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.295.2">Any time you write code, you run the risk of it not working right the first time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.295.3">In fact, you can almost be guaranteed it won’t! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.295.4">You can let this get to you, in which case you’ll have a really bad time of it and not make good progress, or you can learn to accept that it’s just part of the process for things not to work and to have to keep working </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.1">on it.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.297.1">You have to be kind to yourself, in a sense. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.297.2">You’re going to have a lot of little failures as you develop a website, and you’ll have to not beat yourself up for it because it’s part of the process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.297.3">But this is a way in which web development, and really, software development generally, is unique: you can get things wrong many times and keep getting it closer and closer to right, little by little, with no real consequences. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.297.4">It’s not like designing a building where if you get something wrong early, the whole thing may just collapse, costing lots of time, money, and potentially lives. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.297.5">No, if your code doesn’t work right the first time – and again, it probably won’t – this does no real harm. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.297.6">Sure, it costs a little time, but </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.1">that’s it.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.1">So, being patient and being able to handle failure are also key qualities for a web developer to possess, and by combining them, you get the notion of being kind to yourself. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.2">In fact, learning to not view every bit of code that doesn’t work right as a failure at all is really what it’s all about. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.3">It’s simply part of the journey, each and every time, and it’s </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.1">totally okay!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.1">You’ll notice one thing that I didn’t list as a quality a web developer needs, and that’s something that a lot </span><a id="_idIndexMarker024"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.302.1">of people entering the field wonder about: a college degree. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.302.2">So, let’s talk about </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.1">that next!</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.304.1">Do you need a degree?</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.305.1">Of all the questions people have about getting into web development, whether you need to go to college and obtain a </span><a id="_idIndexMarker025"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.1">college degree – usually a Computer Science degree – or not is perhaps the most loaded of them all. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.2">If you look at all the skills you need to be successful in this field, it almost seems like the obvious answer would be yes, you definitely need a degree. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.3">The reality is quite a bit </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.1">different, though.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.308.1">Let me tell you a little bit about myself. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.308.2">As of this writing, I’m 51 years old. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.308.3">I’ve been a professional developer for 28 years, and I did some consulting before that for a bit over 5 years. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.308.4">I’ve been programming in one form or another for right around 45 years in total – yes, I really did start when I was around 6! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.308.5">This has been a lifelong passion of mine, and the fact that I’ve had a long and fruitful career is in some ways just </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.1">a bonus.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.310.1">But you know what I don’t have? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.310.2">That’s right: a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.1">college degree.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.312.1">I did attend college for a little while, but I had to drop out for personal reasons about two years short of a degree. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.312.2">I went back a little later and took some classes with the intent of getting that degree. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.312.3">But I was primarily doing it for career reasons at that point, and here’s the simple truth: not having a degree didn’t stop me from getting into the field and hasn’t ever held me </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.313.1">back any.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.1">Now, I don’t want to give any false impressions here: my path probably would have been easier – and certainly shorter – had I completed my degree in the first place, and I certainly would have made more money right out of the gate than I did. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.2">I also spent a lot of years convinced no one would give me the time of day without that piece of paper hanging on the wall, so I didn’t </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.315.1">even try.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.1">That was </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.1">a mistake.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.318.1">The truth is that in this field, if you can show that you know your stuff, then a degree won’t stop you from getting your foot in the door. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.318.2">It may mean a bit less money at first, and it may mean there’s a ceiling to your career – I’ll probably never have a shot at a C-suite level position (CEO, CIO, etc.) – but you can be gainfully employed without one for sure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.318.3">It’s all about demonstrated ability – even if you have a Computer Science degree, while that shows you probably have a decent foundation, as we previously discussed, you’re still going to have a lot of on-the-job learning to do. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.318.4">Having a degree shows you have many good qualities, but it doesn’t necessarily mean you have even a fraction of the knowledge you need to be a solid </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.319.1">web developer.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.1">And to be clear, some companies </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.1">do</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.322.1"> view having a degree as very important, and some will even use it as a litmus test, meaning if you don’t have one then your resume may get tossed in the trash immediately. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.322.2">It’s a hard requirement for some companies to be sure, though in my experience that’s the exception, not the rule. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.322.3">That’s sad, honestly, because it means these companies are passing up some potentially great candidates for arguably no good reason. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.322.4">But, at the end of the day, that’s their call, and as a job seeker, there’s nothing you can do about it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.322.5">You’ll just have to grin and bear it if you run into such situations and tailor your </span><a id="_idIndexMarker026"/><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.1">search accordingly.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.324.1">So, to summarize: no, having a degree isn’t required to be a web developer – it’s not a dealbreaker if you don’t have one in most cases, and I’m living proof of that! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.324.2">Of course, that doesn’t mean there aren’t benefits to having one, but it primarily comes down to your own goals and desired path. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.324.3">If a degree is important to you, then by all means, get one. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.324.4">If maximizing your earnings at every level is a primary consideration, then yes, a degree may help. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.324.5">If you have dreams of eventually flying on the corporate jet and running the show from the CEO’s office, then yes, you’ll likely need a degree. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.324.6">But you can definitely have a good, long, well-paying career as a web developer without one, so long as you put in the time and effort to make yourself someone whom good companies won’t want to pass up, despite not having the framed paper on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.1">the wall.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.1">Now that you have some idea of what’s involved in being a web developer in terms of abilities, degrees, and such, let’s take a look at what a typical day might look like on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.327.1">the job.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.334.1">This is no simple question because there are a great many variables involved. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.334.2">But if I think through what I and those people I work with do daily, there begins to emerge a very rough and generalized structure that tends to apply to </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.335.1">most</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.336.1"> web developers </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.337.1">most</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.1"> of the time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.2">Let’s see what that </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.1">looks like.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.1">The duties of a web developer</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.1">Firstly, there are some common tasks</span><a id="_idIndexMarker028"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.1"> that you’ll wind up doing </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.1">most days:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.1">Coding</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.1">: Well, I’m sure that’s no surprise! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.2">You will obviously spend a lot of your time writing code to actually make websites. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.3">But depending on the day, sometimes this will be where most of your time goes, and sometimes it’ll wind up being where the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.346.1">least goes.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.347.1">Meetings</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.1">: As with Monty Python and their Spanish Inquisition bit, no one escapes meetings. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.2">It might be with stakeholders to go over the previous day’s work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.3">It might be other developers you have to coordinate with. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.4">It might be your manager to figure out what task to do next. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.5">But regardless of what it’s for, meetings will for sure be a part of your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.349.1">daily life.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.1">Version control</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.351.1">: This is a topic I’ll get into later, but in short, version control is how you keep your work safe so you don’t lose it, and it’s also a way that allows you to go back to a previous version of your work if needed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.351.2">There’s more to it than that, but that’s the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.352.1">10,000-foot view.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.353.1">Testing</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.1">: Once you write your code, you of course need to make sure it works right, so testing will be a big part of what you do. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.2">Sometimes you’ll work with others who will do the testing </span><a id="_idIndexMarker029"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.1">for you, and sometimes you will be doing it yourself (and there are multiple types and levels of testing, but that’s a discussion </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.1">for later).</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.357.1">Documentation</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.1">: Writing various forms of documentation is an important thing to do, for yourself as well as others. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.2">It might be design documents that explain what you’re building, or it might be usage documentation for your end users, to name </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.1">just two.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.360.1">Task management</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.1">: Every project you work on will be broken down into many different parts because beyond a certain level of complexity – a level that you can reach very quickly – a project is too big to do in one piece. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.2">These parts will become tasks, and managing those tasks becomes important to managing the project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.3">This will often take the form of a task management system such as Jira where you will have tickets – tasks, essentially – to work on and that you’ll need to update the status on as you work on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.1">the task.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.1">Deployments</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.364.1">: Once you have code that’s ready for prime time, or even just for testing, you have to put it somewhere that others can access. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.364.2">This is called “deploying” code, and while it’s not something you’ll do every day necessarily, it can be a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.365.1">frequent occurrence.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.366.1">Code reviews</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.367.1">: When you’re working with others, it’s not uncommon to review each other’s work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.367.2">They may send you their changes and ask you to test them or just read the code and look for problems, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.368.1">vice versa.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.369.1">Research</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.370.1">: Taking time to explore new technologies or to figure out how to effectively use one will be a big part of your job as a web developer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.370.2">Building </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.371.1">proof of concept</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.372.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.373.1">PoC</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.1">) code is a </span><a id="_idIndexMarker030"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.375.1">common manifestation of that research. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.375.2">A PoC is a lot like a prototype in that it’s code that may or may not be molded into a final form later on and definitely</span><a id="_idIndexMarker031"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.1"> isn’t written as such from the start. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.2">The key difference – though I’ll say up front that it’s a fine line – is that a PoC is the term usually applied when you aren’t quite sure something is actually doable at all and you want to prove the idea out, whereas, with a prototype, you more or less know it’s doable and you just want to produce something tangible for people to look at and play with a bit before you get into doing it </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.377.1">for real.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.378.1">A typical day</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.1">Okay, those are the kinds of things you can expect to have to do (almost) every day. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.2">But what does a typical day look like? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.3">Again, I have to stress that this is a very generalized description. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.4">No two developers</span><a id="_idIndexMarker032"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.380.1"> will have the same day, and a single developer may have days that vary a lot too. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.380.2">But, as a gross generalization, this probably isn’t too far off what you’ll experience </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.1">most days:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.382.1">8:00 am</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.1">: Arrive at the office or start working remotely. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.2">Check emails and Slack/Discord/Teams messages, and review any issues that may have </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.1">occurred overnight.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.1">8:30 am</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.1">: Daily stand-up meeting. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.2">This is a very brief meeting between team members where you provide your current status, what you did the previous day, what you plan to do today, and any roadblocks you may have. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.3">It’s called a stand-up meeting because it often is done, literally, with everyone standing, with the goal being to ensure it only lasts a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.1">few minutes.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.1">9:00 am</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.1">: Review and prioritize your tasks for the day and update them as necessary in your task </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.390.1">management system.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.1">9:30 am</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.1">: Dive into coding. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.2">Whether that means developing new features, fixing bugs, or reviewing the code of others, it’s time to actually put the pedal to the metal and do </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.393.1">some work!</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.1">11:00 am</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.395.1">: Have a meeting to discuss the project with stakeholders. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.395.2">You may demo what you’ve done recently for them, or just discuss next steps </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.1">and requirements.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.1">12:00 pm</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.398.1">: Break for lunch. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.398.2">This is also a good time to socialize with coworkers a bit. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.398.3">While there is absolutely no requirement that you are friends with the people you work with, being friendly with them really does make for a much better work experience, so don’t sleep on this part of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.1">your day!</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.1">1:00 pm</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.401.1">: Resume coding. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.401.2">This is often a good time of day to focus on more complex tasks that take more mental effort to accomplish, because most people tend to be in a better headspace around this time of day (of course, that’s not true for everyone, and you need to figure out what works for you and arrange your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.402.1">days accordingly).</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.403.1">2:30 pm</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.1">: Attend a meeting to plan future work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.2">A lot of companies use what’s called an Agile methodology, which is something we’ll get into in future chapters. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.3">But, in short, it’s an approach to managing a project that emphasizes small bursts of productivity called sprints</span><a id="_idIndexMarker033"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.1"> and allows a team to self-direct itself (for the most part). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.2">To make this work, meetings to do sprint planning and backlog grooming (essentially, the act of prioritizing known future work) happen </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.406.1">fairly often.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.407.1">3:00 pm</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.408.1">: Return to coding, perhaps this time focusing on unit tests (small, highly focused testing that developers do on small portions of a larger system to ensure they work right individually) or debugging (fixing code that isn’t quite </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.409.1">working right).</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.410.1">4:00 pm</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.411.1">: Update documentation, save the changes you’ve made for the day in a version control system for safekeeping, and begin to plan the next </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.412.1">day’s work.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.413.1">5:00 pm</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.414.1">: Begin to wind down for the day, or perhaps deploy code, depending on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.415.1">the day.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.416.1">6:00 pm</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.1">: Hit the bricks! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.2">Take off, run out the door, whatever phrase you prefer to mean “It’s time to forget this place for the day and have some fun,” because work/life balance is of critical importance, and you should strive to not take your work home in any way. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.3">Once you leave for the day, put it out of your mind as much as possible and enjoy </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.1">your life.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.419.1">I must stress again that this is </span><a id="_idIndexMarker034"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.420.1">an extremely rough and very generalized outline. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.420.2">Your day may look quite different from this. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.420.3">There may be other tasks you have to partake in, and for some of these, you may not do much, if at all. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.420.4">Some days, you’ll spend 99% of your time coding, and other days, you’ll barely write a single line of code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.420.5">Even if the previous workday structure is typical, days will fluctuate for sure, and you’ll need to be okay with that. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.420.6">But this outline shouldn’t be </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.421.1">too</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.1"> far off reality </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.423.1">most</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.424.1"> days in </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.425.1">most</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.426.1"> environments.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.427.1">While I’ve at least hinted at it before now, there’s really one key skill that I think any web developer absolutely needs to have, and that’s </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.428.1">logical thinking.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.429.1">Understanding the one truly invaluable skill: logical thinking</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.430.1">I’ve talked about several skills and abilities you need to have</span><a id="_idIndexMarker035"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.431.1"> as a web developer, and to be sure, they’re all important. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.431.2">But of all of them, the one that I think rises above the rest is logical thinking. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.431.3">I’ve said that before, but let’s talk about why it’s so critical in a bit </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.432.1">more detail.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.433.1">The ability to think logically is at the core of what we web developers do because at the end of the day, what we’re doing is telling the computer what to do. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.433.2">And, as the saying goes, computers will do </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.434.1">exactly</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.435.1"> what you tell them to do (well, with AI in the mix, that’s becoming less and less true with each passing day, and of course, we’re all just hoping that doesn’t change and they don’t go all Skynet on us!). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.435.2">On top of this, computers will do it incredibly fast – so fast that you can’t even comprehend it, and if you tell them to do the wrong thing, well, they’re going to do exactly that very </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.436.1">fast, too!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.1">So, it’s critical that you are able to organize your thoughts and instruct the computer properly to get the results you need. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.2">That means being able to start from fact A, logically figure out what fact B is, and then work out how to get there, rinsing and repeating a few thousand times, and at the end, you might have a working website or piece of software. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.3">To put it another way: the logical ordering of steps, and determining how you can branch from step B to step C, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.438.1">or</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.439.1"> from step B to step D depending on conditions at the time the code executes, is what it’s </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.440.1">all about.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.1">That’s the idea that</span><a id="_idIndexMarker036"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.442.1"> underlies it all, but we can break it down further into sub-categories because logical, ordered thinking is not a single specific skill; it’s really an amalgamation of several broad categories </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.443.1">of skill.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-35"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.444.1">Problem-solving</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.445.1">Being able to solve problems is a skill that requires logical thinking and understanding. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.445.2">Having a clear picture of the desired outcome and seeing a logical set of steps to get to it is necessary to determine</span><a id="_idIndexMarker037"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.446.1"> where in that series of steps a problem is occurring, and then how to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.447.1">fix it.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.448.1">Of course, a “problem” doesn’t just mean when something isn’t working right! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.448.2">A problem is also when you’re building something for the first time from scratch, and having to see to the steps required to achieve your goal. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.448.3">Being able to break complex tasks down into manageable chunks is a hallmark of people who are good, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.449.1">logical thinkers.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.450.1">I should also note that you should be able to adjust your thinking as you go and gain new facts, because that nearly </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.451.1">always</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.1"> happens as you progress in a project. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.2">To paraphrase a famous military saying: no development project survives contact with actually doing the development, meaning that no matter how logical and seemingly complete your thinking, virtually no one gets it 100% right from start to finish. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.3">You have to adapt to those “oh wow, that’s not gonna work like I thought it would” moments that are all </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.453.1">but inevitable.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-36"><a id="_idTextAnchor036"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.454.1">Scalability</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.455.1">One of the big concerns when building software, be it a website or otherwise, is whether it can scale, meaning whether it can handle more usage over time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.455.2">A website can only handle so many users at once, and this is a limit of many factors including the network, the server it’s hosted on, and of course, the code itself. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.455.3">Being able to think logically will allow you to see the places where scalability is limited. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.455.4">For example, if your code frequently reads data from a database, you may consider caching the data, which means storing it in a location </span><a id="_idIndexMarker038"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.456.1">that can be accessed faster than </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.457.1">the database.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.458.1">Another aspect of scalability is being able to change the code over time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.458.2">Thinking logically will allow you to organize the code in such a way that future changes are easier and don’t risk breaking the existing functionality. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.458.3">This might mean abstraction layers (a coding concept that tries to keep two parts of a system separated by a layer that can be changed more easily than either of the two parts), or perhaps a plugin mechanism (the ability to add new code in a standard way that doesn’t require changing existing code), or a myriad of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.459.1">other possibilities.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-37"><a id="_idTextAnchor037"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.1">Team collaboration</span></h2>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.475.1">This is especially true because UX tends to be based on quantifiable, observable facts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.475.2">Things such as user studies come into play, where you observe a user using your website to see where they stumble (and let them tell you specifically). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.475.3">What you’ll find often is that their mental model, that is, how their brain is telling them things should work, won’t always match up with </span><a id="_idIndexMarker042"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.476.1">reality, and you’ll need to logically analyze their expectations as compared to what you built and figure out how to move them </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.477.1">closer together.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.479.1">Software of any kind is designed with “failure modes” in mind. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.479.2">Failure modes are the ways the code you write can fail, which you can determine beforehand. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.479.3">For example, maybe your website has to</span><a id="_idIndexMarker043"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.480.1"> ask another for a banner ad, but what happens if that remote system doesn’t respond? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.480.2">Your code must anticipate and handle that possibility without the whole site crashing and burning before your users’ eyes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.480.3">That’s something you can know is possible as you write the code, so you write code to handle that particular failure mode. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.480.4">Being able to think logically will allow you to find those possible failure modes and code for them, resulting in more reliable code and a better experience for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.481.1">your users.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.482.1">Security</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.483.1">As I’m sure you’re aware, security is of paramount importance these days. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.483.2">It seems like barely a day goes by when we don’t hear about some monumental breach of data on some site. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.483.3">Security is exceptionally difficult to get right, but it’s basically impossible without </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.484.1">logical thinking.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.485.1">Here’s the weird part, though: the way threat actors – or hackers, as people tend to say – work is to think very logically, but in very unexpected ways. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.485.2">You see, they know how your website handles its security tokens, for example. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.485.3">They understand it very logically. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.485.4">But then, they’ll throw logic out the window and start trying things that seem just plain nuts, sometimes! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.485.5">Unfortunately for us developers, they’ll frequently find holes in our security that way. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.485.6">Or sometimes they’ll take a series of logical steps that alone aren’t a problem, but when taken together suddenly result in a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.486.1">security exploit.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.487.1">Your only hope is to be able to match their ability to think logically and outside the box. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.487.2">But you can’t do the latter until you can do </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.488.1">the former!</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.496.1">The idea of data flow is simply how data moves around different parts of your code or system. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.496.2">If you have some data that </span><a id="_idIndexMarker045"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.497.1">describes a person – things such as their name, age, and phone number – that data may have to move around the code to perform</span><a id="_idIndexMarker046"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.498.1"> various functions with it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.498.2">That’s called a “data flow,” an example of which can be seen in </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.499.1">Figure 1</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.500.1">.6</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.501.1">:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.541.1">But you can also get some interesting problems from such simple foundations! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.541.2">One night, Grace discovered that the computer she was working on was giving erroneous results. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.541.3">She began tracing the problem (using logical thinking, of course!) to figure out where the problem was. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.541.4">She eventually found it: there was a deceased moth inside of one of the relays. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.541.5">The moth was stopping a relay from closing when electricity was applied, meaning that the computer saw it as having a value of 0 instead of 1. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.541.6">The report of this incident literally listed the cause of the problem as a “bug” in the relay; hence, a now well-known</span><a id="_idIndexMarker052"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.542.1"> computer term was coined! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.542.2">This is also where the term “debugging” </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.543.1">comes from!</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.545.1">Logical thinking is required when writing documentation of all sorts because if it’s not written logically then no one is going to understand it, and that someone might wind up being you a few </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.546.1">months later!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.547.1">Part of it is being able to get into the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker053"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.1"> heads of your users, in a sense. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.2">You have to understand how they are going to approach using what you create, and you then have to write documentation that anticipates their questions and provides them with the answers they </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.549.1">will need.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.550.1">Of course, documentation for users is only one type of documentation, and it’s actually a type that you may or may not ever need to write, depending on the environment you work in (at my company, we have a team dedicated to this duty, so while I work with them, they are the ones primarily responsible for it). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.550.2">There is also documentation embedded in the code you write, or at least there should be! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.550.3">This type of documentation, called </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.551.1">comments</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.1">, explains </span><a id="_idIndexMarker054"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.553.1">what the code is intended to do, as well as any tricky things that might have come up when writing it that someone may need to know about later. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.553.2">You write these comments for other developers who may have to work on the code someday, but you also write it for yourself, because you will definitely not remember everything that went into the code you wrote a few months later, believe me! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.553.3">Having explanations right there in the code is very important, and these comments clearly need to make sense or they won’t be of much value (they can actually be </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.554.1">harmful</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.555.1"> if not well-written since they can lead a developer down the wrong path), so logical thinking sure does come in handy </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.556.1">here, too!</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.561.1">Where logical thinking comes into play is that once you have some technical know-how and experience, and you see the “new” hotness, you’ll also start to see how it relates to what came before. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.561.2">You’ll connect the dots a lot faster, which means you’ll be able to adapt to the new stuff much</span><a id="_idIndexMarker056"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.562.1"> faster and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.563.1">more efficiently.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.589.1">Being a web developer doesn’t mean being just one thing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.589.2">Well, not necessarily at least. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.589.3">There are variations on</span><a id="_idIndexMarker062"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.590.1"> a theme. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.590.2">It boils down to three main categories that a “web developer” can fall into: frontend, backend, and full stack </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.591.1">web developers.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.592.1">But before we can really even talk about the distinction between these three, you have to have at least a cursory understanding of how a network, the internet, and the web on top of it function, so let’s look at that so you have the necessary foundation to understand the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.593.1">three categories.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor051"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.594.1">The (very) basics of the internet and the web</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.595.1">Before we can get into that, though, I have to make sure you have a basic understanding of how this thing called the web, which is short for the World Wide Web (which, by the way, is where the “www” in addresses for websites come from, as in </span><a href="http://www.google.com"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.596.1">www.google.com</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.597.1">), works at a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.598.1">high level.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.599.1">Firstly, it’s important to realize that the internet isn’t the same as the web. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.599.2">Granted, it’s kind of come to mean the same thing to most people over the years, but strictly speaking, it’s not true. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.599.3">The </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.600.1">web</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.601.1"> is just one</span><a id="_idIndexMarker063"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.602.1"> component of the internet, which is itself a massive number of computers all connected together over a network, similar to what is shown in </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.603.1">Figure 1</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.604.1">.8</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.605.1">:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.608.1">The web is one component, but some others are Usenet (newsgroups), POP3/IMAP/SMTP (email), Gopher (this doesn’t really exist anymore, but it was a precursor to the web), and a few others that are basically irrelevant now. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.608.2">All these things connect over the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.609.1">internet</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.610.1">, but the </span><a id="_idIndexMarker064"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.611.1">web is kind of special because, as I mentioned, it has come to mean the internet itself, since almost all activity on the internet these days is conducted over </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.612.1">the web.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.613.1">But, for our purposes here, that’s all just a bit of history and pedantry. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.613.2">What’s important is what happens when you enter the address of a website into your browser’s address bar. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.613.3">The main thing to understand is that your computer is connecting to another out there, which we term the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.614.1">server</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.615.1">, because it’s </span><a id="_idIndexMarker065"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.616.1">serving content to your machine. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.616.2">When you type in, say, </span><strong class="source-inline"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.617.1">google.com</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.618.1">, your computer makes a connection to a computer owned by Google. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.618.2">That server returns the code that makes up the Google website to your browser, which then uses those instructions to show the page on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.619.1">your screen.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.620.1">When you develop a website, there is code that runs in the browser, but there is also code that runs on the server, which produces the code that the browser executes, in a sense. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.620.2">This dichotomy is where two types of web developers come into play: frontend developers and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.621.1">backend developers.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.622.1">Two sides of a coin – frontend and backend developers</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.623.1">Frontend developers write the code that the browser executes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.623.2">They deal with things such as </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.624.1">HTML</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.625.1"> (an acronym for </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.626.1">HyperText Markup Language</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.627.1">), CSS, and JavaScript (which I’ll abbreviate as JS from here on out, and which is a programming language your browser understands). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.627.2">We’ll dive into these in the chapters to come, but for now, the key thing to understand is that these </span><a id="_idIndexMarker066"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.628.1">are essentially the three pillars of the web. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.628.2">They</span><a id="_idIndexMarker067"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.629.1"> are, by and large, all your browser knows how to work with, and they are the three technologies that all websites are </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.630.1">built on.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.631.1">Now, because I don’t want to leave you hanging, here’s an example of all of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.632.1">those technologies:</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.645.1">Backend developers, by</span><a id="_idIndexMarker069"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.646.1"> contrast, write the code that executes on the server. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.646.2">There are many different technologies you might deal with there. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.646.3">Some of the most popular today are Java, Node, PHP, and .NET, but that’s far from an exhaustive list. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.646.4">A backend developer specializes in these technologies, and for the most part isn’t concerned with what winds up on your screen, at least not in a direct way like frontend developers are. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.646.5">Instead, they deal more with things such as databases, cloud compute layers (something else we’ll touch on later), caching, app servers, session management, authentication, authorization (proving who you are and what you’re allowed to do), </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.647.1">and more.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.648.1">Some developers specialize in one of these two areas, and they let someone else do the other side of the equation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.648.2">In some organizations, there will be entire teams dedicated to each side of the client/server divide, and rarely will they meet directly (to be sure, they have to communicate and</span><a id="_idIndexMarker070"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.649.1"> work together, but they basically function independently except at the point where they have to integrate </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.650.1">their work).</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor053"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.651.1">And the, uhh, third side of the coin – full-stack developers!</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.652.1">By contrast, there are also full stack developers, which means web developers who deal with both frontend and backend coding. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.652.2">I think it’s reasonable to say that there are more web developers who are full-stack developers these days than specialized ones, and there do tend to be more job</span><a id="_idIndexMarker071"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.653.1"> opportunities for full-stack developers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.653.2">Obviously, though, that requires learning more and being able to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.654.1">do more.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.655.1">In the next chapter, I’m going to go into a bit more detail about these roles, especially the full stack developer role, but these descriptions are the broad strokes, so </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.656.1">to speak.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.657.1">Another way to classify web developers</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.658.1">Aside from the frontend versus backend versus full stack classifications, the other thing that tends to divide web developers is whether you’re a full-time employee somewhere, or a member of the “</span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.659.1">gig economy.”</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.660.1">Being a full-time employee </span><a id="_idIndexMarker072"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.661.1">means what it means in any other job: you work for someone, probably 40 hours a week or so generally. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.661.2">You’ll be at the whim of others, and your client, your stakeholder, is essentially your boss. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.661.3">They’ll tell you what to build, and you certainly will have input, but it’s ultimately up to them what gets done, and to a certain extent, how it </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.662.1">gets done.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.663.1">Being full-time has some clear benefits. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.663.2">For one thing, it’s steady work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.663.3">You know you’re getting a paycheck every week or two, and the odds are you’ll be salaried so that income will be consistent. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.663.4">Benefits such as health insurance tend to be handled by the company (which can be a negative too, depending on what they offer, but at least you’ll have the option without having to go out and get it yourself). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.663.5">Things such as 401Ks, bonuses, and profit-sharing may be part of your total compensation package </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.664.1">as well.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.665.1">The other career path is being a consultant, contractor, or freelancer, which are all more or less the same thing: you work for someone for a set-length engagement, and then you move on to another job. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.665.2">This path is appealing to many people because it means more freedom, as well as exposure to more technologies and a more diverse slate of work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.665.3">Some people find this extremely stimulating and rewarding. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.665.4">There is also – generally speaking – more opportunity for higher pay because you can set your own rates, and if someone is willing to pay that rate, then it might be a lot more than you could get at a regular </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.666.1">full-time job.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.667.1">But there are also negatives to be aware of. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.667.2">Remember when I mentioned health insurance? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.667.3">Well, that’ll be </span><a id="_idIndexMarker073"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.668.1">your problem; you’ll have to go out, find insurance that works for you, and purchase it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.668.2">You’ll need to worry about paying that bill every month rather than it just coming off the top of your regular paycheck in a full-time job. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.668.3">Also, taxes are something you’ll have to account for and pay yourself. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.668.4">Independent work such as this can also be more frustrating than a regular gig because clients will sometimes treat contractors a little less nicely than their regular employees (this obviously depends on the client – some are absolutely fantastic and treat you practically like family, so long as you’re doing the job well </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.669.1">for them!).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.670.1">Ultimately, which path you choose, in terms of regular full-time employment or a freelance approach, will be entirely up to you. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.670.2">You have to look at the pluses and minuses and decide what’s important to you. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.670.3">And note that whichever way you go, you can still choose to specialize in frontend or backend or to be a full stack developer (though if you decide to be a specialized freelancer then that’s going to limit your opportunities even more than if you do that with a full-time job, so you might want to consider </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.671.1">that too).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.672.1">Knowing the types of web developers there are and how we classify web developer jobs is helpful for sure, since it allows you to tailor your learning to the topics that are critical to the role that you’re interested in. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.672.2">With that in mind, let’s talk a little about some other ways, besides self-guided learning, that you might employ to meet your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.673.1">learning goals.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor055"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.674.1">Learning with, and from, others</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.675.1">I’ve mentioned the notion of self-guided learning a few times, at least the basic concept of it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.675.2">It’s not possible to learn enough on your own in all fields to be able to get a job, but this is one field where that’s definitely possible, and even necessary over time since you’ll never be able to stop </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.676.1">learning completely.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.677.1">But in this section, I want to point out that it’s not the only option available to you. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.677.2">You’ll need to figure out what your own personal learning style is because not everyone is able to effectively learn the same way. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.677.3">Some people can read a book such as this and get everything they need from it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.677.4">Others can watch a bunch of videos on YouTube and be all the better for it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.677.5">And some people </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.678.1">need</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.679.1"> to be in a classroom environment, and they </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.680.1">must</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.681.1"> have a person they can interact with and question along the way. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.681.2">All of these are valid learning styles, and you should never be ashamed of your own learning style. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.681.3">Instead, once you understand what it is, embrace it and look for options that fit it to make the most effective use of your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.682.1">learning time.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.683.1">But if you determine that self-guided learning, in whatever form that takes, isn’t what’s best for you, here are a few more options you can consider, aside from </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.684.1">formal schooling.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.685.1">Boot camps</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.686.1">Aside from the obvious option of </span><a id="_idIndexMarker074"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.687.1">college, there are other learning opportunities available to people these days, probably the most well-known being boot camps. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.687.2">A boot camp is essentially a relatively short – as compared to college – and very intensive class or series of classes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.687.3">They tend to last 3-6 months, though can be shorter or longer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.687.4">The goal of a boot camp is to teach you things very quickly to get you ready for entry into a career as quickly as possible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.687.5">These are good choices for some people, though probably </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.688.1">not everyone.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.691.1">For one thing, boot camps </span><a id="_idIndexMarker075"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.692.1">tend to be best for people who already have some degree of technical know-how. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.692.2">While not impossible, it would be very difficult to go from essentially zero technical knowledge to knowing enough to find a job in this field from just a boot camp. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.692.3">But, if you already have some knowledge, a boot camp can build upon that foundation quickly in an </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.693.1">effective way.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.694.1">Boot camps, however, are not free. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.694.2">Their cost can vary a lot, from several hundred dollars to many thousands of dollars. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.694.3">That’s one of the pluses of self-guided learning: while there are many paid options, there are also a ton of good free ones. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.694.4">Still, having someone guide you and having someone whom you can ask questions during your learning is a benefit of a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.695.1">boot camp.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.696.1">Boot camps are also viable for developers who are already working. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.696.2">You may have to shift gears – perhaps from frontend to backend, as an example – and get up to speed quickly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.696.3">Boot camps could be ideal for that, especially if your current employer is willing to foot </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.697.1">the bill.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.698.1">As you might guess, the quality of boot camps varies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.698.2">If you get into a good one, you’ll definitely get your money’s worth and learn a lot quickly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.698.3">But there’s a chance the one you pick won’t be very good and will only give you a very surface-level understanding. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.698.4">This might not be a major problem if you’re already a developer and are just learning a new skill (though it’s still not ideal when you’re paying for it), but it’s a bigger risk for someone who expects to find gainful first-time employment out of a boot camp. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.698.5">So, before you sign up for one, make</span><a id="_idIndexMarker076"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.699.1"> sure you do your research. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.699.2">Read as many reviews as you can, and try to find people who have been through it to get a direct opinion of it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.699.3">Boot camps have value, but they aren’t the be-all and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.700.1">end-all either.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.701.1">The personal touch</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.702.1">Another approach you can take is to find </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.703.1">a mentor.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.704.1">In the early 80s, when I began learning Assembly language (which is a particularly unpleasant language to program in) for the old Commodore 64 computer, I had books and magazine articles to read, but it never </span><a id="_idIndexMarker077"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.705.1">felt like enough. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.705.2">I figured a lot of things out that way, but I was never able to do the more complex things I saw in video games and other programs of the day. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.705.3">That changed when I found an especially kind older kid who </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.706.1">was</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.707.1"> able to do those things and took me under his wing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.707.2">My learning accelerated exponentially almost overnight and before long, I was creating things that I’d thought I’d never be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.708.1">able to.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.709.1">Finding a mentor these days is difficult, but not impossible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.709.2">It takes getting into contact with people who know what you want to learn and approaching them, hoping someone will show the same kind of kindness that kid did for me. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.709.3">It’s a big ask, to be sure; we’re all busy as heck these days, and taking time out for someone else like that is no small thing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.709.4">But now and again, you’ll meet someone willing to, and that can be a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.710.1">big boost.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.711.1">How would you meet such people when you aren’t already in the field? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.711.2">Well, one way – something I’ll get into a bit more later – is meetups, or as we used to call them: user groups. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.711.3">There are websites that will give you a list of such things in your area, and they usually let anyone come to them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.711.4">There, you’ll meet techies of all sorts and experience levels. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.711.5">If you’re an outgoing person, this is a great chance to meet them, get to know them, and maybe eventually ask someone to mentor you. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.711.6">Again, it’s not something you can </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.712.1">expect</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.713.1"> of people – you certainly can’t get mad at anyone who says no – but some people simply enjoy the process of teaching others. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.713.2">It’s one of the main reasons I’ve written as many books as I have. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.713.3">If you can find someone with that mindset, then you’ve found yourself a good resource and you </span><a id="_idIndexMarker078"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.714.1">shouldn’t be shy about taking advantage </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.715.1">of it.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.716.1">On-the-job learning</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.717.1">The final thing I’ll mention is on-the-job training. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.717.2">Web development isn’t like a trade field, where you can sometimes</span><a id="_idIndexMarker079"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.718.1"> find entry-level positions as an apprentice and you’ll be taught the trade from scratch. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.718.2">There are sometimes web development internships along those lines, but they are fairly rare and generally for students coming out of school – besides that, entry-level jobs in software development where you aren’t expected to know anything up-front are </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.719.1">virtually non-existent.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.720.1">Instead, you’ll be expected to know some stuff from day one. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.720.2">Of course, that isn’t to say that you have to know </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.721.1">everything</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.722.1"> – to be sure, you will learn on the job as a matter of course – it’s just that you can’t go in without at least </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.723.1">foundational knowledge.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.724.1">The bottom line to all of this, whether you’re considering boot camps, mentorships, or even internships if you can manage to find one, is to always take advantage of the knowledge of others any time you can. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.724.2">Listen to them, learn from them, and try and get as much benefit from their experience and expertise as you can. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.724.3">Other people can be a valuable resource in your learning journey outside of a classroom setting, so don’t miss the opportunity to avail yourself of folks when </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.725.1">you can.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.734.1">As you can see, it doesn’t show much right now. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.734.2">What it does show is the central starting point – </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.735.1">Web Developer</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.736.1"> – and the critical skill of </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.737.1">Logical Thinking</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.738.1"> (on the left), perhaps the one true foundational </span><a id="_idIndexMarker081"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.739.1">ability a web developer needs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.739.2">As we progress through the book, each square will be revealed, illustrating the key skills that go into being a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.740.1">web developer.</span></span></p>
<p class="callout-heading"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.741.1">Note</span></p>
<p class="callout"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.742.1">Although tangential, it may be worth noting that this type of diagram, which is usually called a mindmap or sometimes a</span><a id="_idIndexMarker082"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.743.1"> creative radial diagram, is often seen when developing software of all types, including websites. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.743.2">It shows the relationship between parts of a larger concept, whether that concept is a web developer as it is here, a web page (where the center point might be the screen that a user sees when they first come to the site), or perhaps showing different components of a system and how they connect to each other. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.743.3">So, seeing it here and being able to understand it is in itself a useful skill </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.744.1">to learn!</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.745.1">Summary</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.746.1">In this chapter, you got a brief introduction to the field of web development. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.746.2">Here, you developed a mental picture of what the job entails, what skills are necessary, and what type of people are typically good </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.747.1">at it.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.748.1">We talked about how to determine whether it’s right for you, including the fact that you like to solve puzzles since that is, to a large extent, what the job is all about! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.748.2">If you find that fun, as I do, then you’ll love </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.749.1">the field!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.750.1">We also started building the very lowest levels of a knowledge foundation that we can build upon going forward and learned how logical thinking is a key requirement, as is the ability to learn new things. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.750.2">You got your first look at some real code, and hopefully, you played with it in a real web browser and saw it in action. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.750.3">And while it wasn’t anything grandiose, I hope it at least started to get you excited about what’s </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.751.1">to come.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.752.1">Plus, you caught a glimpse of a typical day in the life of a web developer and gained an understanding of the different types of web developers (and where those types overlap). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.752.2">Maybe you even started to consider what side of the frontend/backend divide you might prefer (though get ready, because from here on out, you’re going to get some experience </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.753.1">with both!).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.754.1">In fact, in the next chapter, we’ll peer a bit deeper into the differences between frontend developers and backend developers, and the intersection of the two in the full-stack developer title. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.754.2">This is a topic worthy of further exploration – which I hope you find fun and mentally stimulating – and that’s exactly where we’re </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.755.1">headed next!</span></span></p>
