I asked it to myself a lot of times when HTML5 mobile gaming started to become popular. I was just thinking it was a waste of time to simply care about the different screen resolutions and aspect ratios, so my first HTML5 game was made to perfectly fit my iPad 2 tablet.</p><p>When I finally showed it to sponsors, most of them said something like "Hey, I like the game, but unfortunately it does not look that good on my iPhone". "Don't worry", I said, "you'll get the game optimized for iPad and iPhone". Unfortunately, it did not look that good on the Galaxy Note. Neither did it on the Samsung S4.</p><p>You can imagine the rest of this story. I found myself almost rewriting the game with a series of <code class="literal">if.. then.. else</code> loops, trying to make it look good on any device.</p><p>This is why you should make a cross-platform game: <span class="emphasis"><em>To code once and rule them all</em></span>. Focus on game <a id="id1" class="indexterm"/>development and let a framework do the dirty work for you.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="What Cocos2d-JS is and how it works"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec09"/>What Cocos2d-JS is and how it works</h1></div></div></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Cocos2d-JS</strong></span> is a free <a id="id2" class="indexterm"/>open source 2D game framework. It can help you to <a id="id3" class="indexterm"/>develop cross-platform browser games and native applications. This framework allows you to write games in JavaScript. So, if you have already developed JavaScript applications, you don't have to learn a new language from scratch. Throughout this book, you will learn how to create almost any kind of cross-platform game using a familiar and intuitive language.</p><div class="section" title="Requirements to run Cocos2d-JS"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec08"/>Requirements to run Cocos2d-JS</h2></div></div></div><p>Before <a id="id4" class="indexterm"/>you start, let's see what software you need to install on your <a id="id5" class="indexterm"/>computer in order to start developing with Cocos2d-JS:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Firstly, you need a text editor. The official IDE for Cocos2d-JS coding is <span class="strong"><strong>Cocos Code IDE</strong></span>, which <a id="id6" class="indexterm"/>you can download for free at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.cocos2d-x.org/products/codeide">http://www.cocos2d-x.org/products/codeide</a>. It features auto completion, code hinting, and some more interesting characteristics to speed up your coding. If you are used to your favorite code editor, that's fine. There are <a id="id7" class="indexterm"/>plenty of them, but I personally use PSPad (you can <a id="id8" class="indexterm"/>find this at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.pspad.com/">http://www.pspad.com/</a>) on my Windows machine and TextWrangler (you can find this at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/</a>) on the Mac. They are both free and easy to use, so you can download and have them installed in a matter of minutes.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">To test your Cocos2d-JS projects, you will need to install a web server on your computer to override security limits when running your project locally. I am using <a id="id9" class="indexterm"/>WAMP (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.wampserver.com/">http://www.wampserver.com/</a>) <a id="id10" class="indexterm"/>on my Windows machine, and MAMP (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.mamp.info/">http://www.mamp.info/</a>) on the Mac.<div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip02"/>Tip</h3><p>Again, both are free to use as you won't need the PRO version, which is also available for Mac computers. Explaining all the theory behind this is beyond the scope of this book, but you can find all the required information as well as the installation documentation on the official sites.</p></div></div></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">If you prefer, you can test your projects directly online by uploading them on an FTP space you own and call them directly from the web. In this case, you don't need to have a web server installed on your computer, but I highly recommend using WAMP or MAMP instead.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">I personally use <a id="id11" class="indexterm"/>Google Chrome as the default browser to test my projects. As these projects are meant to be cross-platform games, it should run in the same way on every browser, so feel free to use the browser you prefer.</li></ul></div><p>The latest <a id="id12" class="indexterm"/>information about Cocos2d-JS can be found on the official page <a class="ulink" href="http://www.cocos2d-x.org/wiki/Cocos2d-JS">http://www.cocos2d-x.org/wiki/Cocos2d-JS</a>, while the latest version can be downloaded at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.cocos2d-x.org/download">http://www.cocos2d-x.org/download</a>.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note02"/>Note</h3><p>Cocos2d-JS is updated quite frequently, but at the time of writing, the latest stable release is v3.1. Although new releases always bring some changes, all examples included in this book should work fine with any release marked as 3.x as there aren't huge changes in the roadmap.</p></div></div><p>You will notice the <a id="id13" class="indexterm"/>download file is a <code class="literal">ZIP</code> file that is greater than 250 MB. Don't worry. Most of the content of the package is made by docs, graphic assets, and examples, while the only required folder, at the moment, is the one called <code class="literal">cocos2d-html5</code>.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="The structure of your Cocos2d-JS project"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec10"/>The structure of your Cocos2d-JS project</h1></div></div></div><p>Every <a id="id14" class="indexterm"/>HTML5 game is basically a web page with some magic in it; this <a id="id15" class="indexterm"/>is what you are going to create with Cocos2d-JS: a web page with some magic in it.</p><p>To perform this magic, a certain file structure needs to be created, so let's take a look at a screenshot of a folder with a Cocos2d-JS project in it:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0075OS_01_01.jpg" alt="The structure of your Cocos2d-JS project"/></div><p>This is what you are going to build; to tell you the truth, this is a picture of the actual project folder I built <a id="id16" class="indexterm"/>for the example to be explained in this chapter, which is placed in the WAMP <code class="literal">localhost</code> folder on my computer. It couldn't be any more real.</p><p>So, let's take <a id="id17" class="indexterm"/>a look at the files to be created:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">cocos2d-html5</code>: This <a id="id18" class="indexterm"/>is the folder you will find in the zip archive.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">index.html</code>: This <a id="id19" class="indexterm"/>is the web page that will contain the game.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">main.js</code>:This is a <a id="id20" class="indexterm"/>file required by Cocos2d-JS with the Cocos2d-JS function calls to make the game start. You will create this within the next few minutes.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">project.json</code>: This is <a id="id21" class="indexterm"/>a <span class="strong"><strong>JavaScript Object Notation</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>JSON</strong></span>) with some basic configurations. This is what you <a id="id22" class="indexterm"/>need to make your game run. Well, almost, because the actual game will be placed in the <code class="literal">src</code> folder. Let's see a few other things first.</li></ul></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Hello Cross-World"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec11"/>Hello Cross-World</h1></div></div></div><p>The time has <a id="id23" class="indexterm"/>come, the boring theory has ended, and we can now start coding our first project. Let's begin!</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Firstly, create a page called <code class="literal">index.html</code> in the root of the game folder and write this HTML code:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;
      My Awesome game
    &lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;script src="cocos2d-html5/CCBoot.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="main.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body style="padding:0;margin:0;background-color:#000000;"&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre></div><p>There's nothing interesting in it as it is just plain HTML. Let's take a closer look at these lines to see what is going on:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;script src=" cocos2d-html5/CCBoot.js "&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre></div><p>Here, I am including the Cocos2d-JS boot file to make the framework start:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;script src="main.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre></div><p>From the preceding line, this is where we call the script with the actual game we are going to build. Next, we have the following code:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;canvas id="gameCanvas"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;</pre></div><p>This is the canvas we will use to display the game. Notice here that the canvas does not have a width and height, as they will be defined by the game itself.</p></li><li class="listitem">Next is the creation of <code class="literal">main.js</code>: the only file we will call from our main <code class="literal">index.html</code> page. This is more of a configuration file rather than the game itself, so you won't code anything that is game-related at the moment. However, the file you are going to build will be the blueprint you will be using in all your Cocos2d-JS games.<p>The content of <code class="literal">main.js</code> is as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">cc.game.onStart = function(){
    cc.view.setDesignResolutionSize(320, 480, cc.ResolutionPolicy.SHOW_ALL);
    cc.director.runScene(new gameScene());
};
cc.game.run();</pre></div><p>Don't worry about the code at the moment; it looks a lot more complicated than it really is. At the moment, the only line we have to worry about is the one that defines the resolution policy.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip03"/>Tip</h3><p>One of the most challenging tasks in cross-platform development is to provide a good gaming experience, no matter what browser or what device the game is running on. However, the problem here is that each device has its own resolution, screen size, and ratio.</p></div></div><p>Cocos2d-JS <a id="id24" class="indexterm"/>allows us to handle different resolutions in a similar way web designers do when building responsive design. At the moment, we just want to adapt the game canvas to fit the browser window while targeting the most popular resolution, which is 320x480 (portrait mode). That's what this line does:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"> cc.view.setDesignResolutionSize(320, 480, cc.ResolutionPolicy.SHOW_ALL);</pre></div><p>Using these settings, you should be pretty sure that your game will run on every device, although you will be working in a low resolution.</p><p>Also, have a look at this line:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">cc.director.runScene(new gameScene());</pre></div><p>Basically, a Cocos2d-JS game is made by a scene where the game itself runs. There can be more scenes in the same game. Imagine a scene with the title screen, a scene with the game over screen, and a scene with the game itself. At the moment, you only have one scene called <code class="literal">gameScene</code>. Remember this name because you are going to use it later.</p></li><li class="listitem">Following this, the next required blueprint file you are going to build is <code class="literal">project.json</code>, which has some interesting settings. Let's take a look at the file first:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">{
  "debugMode" : 0,
  "showFPS" : false,
  "frameRate" : 60,
  "id" : "gameCanvas",

  "modules" : ["cocos2d"],

  "jsList" : [
    "src/gamescript.js"

}</pre></div><p>What do these lines mean? Let's see them one by one:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">debugMode</code>: This <a id="id25" class="indexterm"/>is the object key that determines the level of debug warnings.

Leave it at 0 at the moment since the project is very simple and we won't make any errors.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">showFPS</code>: This <a id="id26" class="indexterm"/>object can be <span class="strong"><strong>true</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>false</strong></span>; it shows or hides the FPS meter on the screen.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">frameRate</code>: This <a id="id27" class="indexterm"/>object sets the frame rate of your game. Set it to <code class="literal">60</code> to have a smooth game.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">id</code>: This is the <a id="id28" class="indexterm"/>DOM element that is required to run the game.

Here you are.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">engineDir</code>: This <a id="id29" class="indexterm"/>is the folder where Cocos2d-JS is installed.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">modules</code>: This <a id="id30" class="indexterm"/>object engines the modules to load. At the moment, we only need the basic Cocos2d library.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">jsList</code>: This is <a id="id31" class="indexterm"/>an array with the files used in the game. This means we are going to create our game in <code class="literal">src/gamescript.js</code>.</li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem">Finally, we arrive at the game script itself. This is the one that will contain the actual game, <code class="literal">gamescript.js</code>, which at the moment is just a plain declaration of the game scene:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">var gameScene = cc.Scene.extend({
  onEnter:function () {
    this._super();
    console.log("my awesome game starts here");
  }
});</pre></div><p>Here, you want to save everything and call <code class="literal">index.html</code> page from your <code class="literal">localhost</code> (refer to your WAMP or MAMP docs) in your browser. If you now open the developer console, you should see:</p><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>my awesome game starts here</strong></span>
</p></li></ol></div><p>Congratulations! This <a id="id32" class="indexterm"/>means you have successfully managed to create a Cocos2d-JS template file to build your future games.</p><p>Let's build our first mini game at once!</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Preloading and adding images"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec12"/>Preloading and adding images</h1></div></div></div><p>In this example, I am using a 64x64 <code class="literal">PNG</code> image representing a target, as shown in the following figure:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0075OS_01_02.jpg" alt="Preloading and adding images"/></div><p>You are obviously free to use whatever image you prefer.</p><p>When you load a web page, in most cases, the page is loaded and shown before all images are loaded. This might sound okay on a web page because readers won't mind if they have to wait a couple of seconds before an image is showed, but this definitively can't happen in a game. This <a id="id33" class="indexterm"/>means our images need to be preloaded, and Cocos2d-JS can easily handle this. The steps on how to preload images in your game are as follows:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">This is the <a id="id34" class="indexterm"/>first time you add this line to the <code class="literal">project.json</code> file:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">{

  "jsList" : [
    <span class="strong"><strong>"src/loadassets.js",</strong></span>
    "src/gamescript.js"
  ]
}</pre></div><p>This means you are going to create another file called <code class="literal">loadassets.js</code> in the same <code class="literal">src</code> folder where you just created <code class="literal">gamescript.js</code>.</p><p>This is the content of <code class="literal">loadassets.js</code>:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">var gameResources = [
     "assets/target.png"
];</pre></div><p>An array called <code class="literal">gameResources</code> stores the assets to preload.

In a real-world example, a level background is in the bottom-most layer, player and enemies will be created in a layer above the background, and game information such as score and remaining lives are placed on the topmost layer.</li><li class="listitem">Finally, all layers can have one or more <code class="literal">Sprite</code> objects, which are the graphic assets themselves such as the player, the enemies, or in this case, the target.</li><li class="listitem">To summarize, the code means that once <code class="literal">gameScene</code> is executed, create and add the <code class="literal">game</code> layer, and in this layer, add the <code class="literal">target</code> sprite.</li></ol></div><p>It's time to test the <a id="id38" class="indexterm"/>project by calling the <code class="literal">index.html</code> file, and the following screenshot is what you should get:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/0075OS_01_03.jpg" alt="Preloading and adding images"/></div><p>Although it's <a id="id39" class="indexterm"/>just a basic project, there are several things to take note of:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Images are preloaded and a default loading screen is shown.
