    famous Flash hits and successful native mobile games, but also original games
    tailored for mobile browsers are played by millions of players everyday.

- en: With a continuously growing number of mobile devices available to play HTML5
    games, and with each one having its own resolution, and display size, and ratio,
    creating a game version for each device would make you waste a lot of time. That's
    why there's a new way to make HTML5 games called **cross-platform**. It means
    you create a game once, and some magic adapts it to every device capable of running
    HTML5 content.

    actually love, making games, and takes care of screen resolutions and ratios.
    Also, you will be using one of the simplest and most widely known languages ever:
    JavaScript. Last but not least, it''s free. You can create the next big game at
    no cost.'
