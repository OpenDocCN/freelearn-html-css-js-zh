			<h1 id="_idParaDest-80"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor079"/>Chapter 6</em>: Grading Written Assignments in a Flash</h1>
			<p>Now that you have your student files, it's time to grade them. Marking assignments is one of the necessary evils for teachers. There is never time during the day to mark all the assignments students turn in. Therefore, we teachers also have constant homework, where we are marking assignments at home. Thankfully, Google Classroom and other Google Apps help reduce the time it takes to grade and return assignments. Not to mention, this reduces your environmental impact by reducing the paper use within your classroom.</p>
			<p>This chapter will focus on grading written assignments, whereas the next chapter will focus on creating and grading multiple choice, numeric response, and fill-in-the-blank type questions.</p>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you will be able to do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Assign a grade to an <strong class="bold">Assignment</strong> post</li>
				<li>Publish a private comment in an <strong class="bold">Assignment</strong> post</li>
				<li>Create comments and give suggestions in a Google Doc</li>
				<li>Save and use comments in the Comment bank</li>
				<li>Reply, resolve, and manage Google Doc comments</li>
				<li>Monitor student progress in a Google Doc with Version history</li>
				<li>Create and grade an assignment submission using a rubric</li>
				<li>Mark an assignment submission using a tablet</li>
				<li>View all student assignment and grades</li>
			</ul>
			<p>With such a jam-packed chapter, let's jump right in!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-81"><a id="_idTextAnchor080"/>Assigning a grade using the Grading Tool</h1>
			<p>The Google Classroom web page for assignment submissions is the same page you use for Question <a id="_idIndexMarker268"/>post submissions, which you learned about in <a href="B16846_04_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor055"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Starting an Online Discussion with Questions</em>. Check out that chapter for <a id="_idIndexMarker269"/>in-depth steps regarding changing how many points an assignment is worth and other tips. Assignments have an additional page <a id="_idIndexMarker270"/>where grades can be assigned – <strong class="bold">the Grading Tool</strong>. To assign and return an assignment using the Grading Tool, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> section, click on the <strong class="bold">Assignment</strong> post title, and then click on <strong class="bold">View assignment</strong>:<div id="_idContainer245" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_6.1_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.1 – Opening the Assignment post in Classwork&#13;&#10;" width="680" height="316"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.1 – Opening the Assignment post in Classwork</p></li>
				<li>In the main section of the assignment's <strong class="bold">Student Work</strong> page, click on the thumbnail of the student's assignment to view the document in the Grading Tool:<div id="_idContainer246" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_6.2_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.2 – Student assignment submission thumbnail&#13;&#10;" width="367" height="354"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.2 – Student assignment submission thumbnail</p><p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">Compatible documents such as Google Docs or media files will open in the Grading Tool. All other files will download to your computer.</p></li>
				<li>Assign <a id="_idIndexMarker271"/>a grade to the student in the <a id="_idIndexMarker272"/>right sidebar:<div id="_idContainer247" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_6.3_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.3 – The Grade field in the Grading Tool&#13;&#10;" width="747" height="398"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.3 – The Grade field in the Grading Tool</p></li>
				<li>When you are ready to return the assignment, click the <strong class="bold">Return</strong> button at the top right of the Grading Tool:<div id="_idContainer248" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_6.4_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.4 – The Return button in the Grading Tool&#13;&#10;" width="628" height="300"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.4 – The Return button in the Grading Tool</p></li>
				<li>A dialog box will appear to confirm that the assignment is being returned:</li>
			</ol>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.5 – The confirmation dialog box</p>
			<p>If you <a id="_idIndexMarker273"/>want to return multiple assignments, click <a id="_idIndexMarker274"/>on the drop-down menu beside the <strong class="bold">Return</strong> button and select <strong class="bold">Return multiple submissions</strong>. The confirmation dialog box will have checkboxes beside each student's name to select which students' assignments to return:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.6 – Return multiple submissions option</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Adding a private comment when returning multiple assignments</p>
			<p class="callout">When returning multiple assignments in the Grading Tool, there is no field to enter a private comment for all selected students like there is on the Student work page of the <strong class="bold">Assignment</strong> post. Oftentimes, I go back to the <strong class="bold">Assignment</strong> post when I'm returning work so that I can add that final private comment for each student.</p>
			<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker275"/>drop-down menu beside the <strong class="bold">Return</strong> button, there <a id="_idIndexMarker276"/>is another option, <strong class="bold">Return this submission</strong>, which performs the same action as the <strong class="bold">Return</strong> button.</p>
			<p>Once the assignment has been returned, like the <strong class="bold">Questions</strong> post, students will receive an email notification and will be able to see the feedback in Google Classroom. In the next section, we will see how we can provide feedback to the assignment.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-82"><a id="_idTextAnchor081"/>Providing feedback with private messages and comments</h1>
			<p>Usually, teachers are encouraged to provide meaningful feedback in addition to a grade so that <a id="_idIndexMarker277"/>students can receive guidance to improve their work. You can provide written feedback through private <a id="_idIndexMarker278"/>messages within the Grading Tool and comments within the submitted Google Docs.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Private messages</strong> are feedback <a id="_idIndexMarker279"/>for the entire assignment. They are <a id="_idIndexMarker280"/>similar to writing a couple of sentences at the end of an essay or lab report. In the Grading Tool, there is a field to add a private message. Once the message has been written, clicking the send icon will publish the message. Here, the student will receive an email notification and can respond to the private message:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer251" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.7_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.7 – Private comments section in the Grading Tool&#13;&#10;" width="394" height="360"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.7 – Private comments section in the Grading Tool</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Don't Delay! Publish Private Comments Right Away!</p>
			<p class="callout">Private messages are not saved. Therefore, remember to publish them immediately. If you close the Grading Tool page or navigate to another student's assignment submission, you will lose any unpublished <strong class="bold">Private comments</strong> for the current student.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-83"><a id="_idTextAnchor082"/>Adding comments to student files</h2>
			<p>While you can add private comments to the assignment, comments can also be added directly to <a id="_idIndexMarker281"/>the content of a Google Doc. You can add a comment to a Google Doc, Google Slide, Google Sheet, and image file. This method of feedback allows you to highlight specific parts of the assignment to comment on. With the Google Doc submission open (or open in the Grading Tool), use these steps to add a comment to a Google Doc from the Grading Tool:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In the Grading Tool, if the student's Google Doc is not open, select <strong class="bold">Google Doc</strong> in the <strong class="bold">Files</strong> section of the right sidebar.</li>
				<li>In the Google Doc, highlight the content you wish to comment on:<div id="_idContainer252" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_6.8_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.8 – Highlighting text for commenting&#13;&#10;" width="624" height="50"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.8 – Highlighting text for commenting</p></li>
				<li>An icon to add the comment will appear on the right margin of the Google Doc. Click this icon to open the <strong class="bold">Comment</strong> dialog box:<div id="_idContainer253" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_6.9_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.9 – The Add Comment icon&#13;&#10;" width="680" height="160"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.9 – The Add Comment icon</p><p>Other ways to start a comment is to click the icon present in the toolbar to add the <a id="_idIndexMarker282"/>comment or by going to the <strong class="bold">Insert</strong> menu:</p><div id="_idContainer254" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_6.10_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.10 – Alternative Add Comment buttons&#13;&#10;" width="711" height="469"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.10 – Alternative Add Comment buttons</p></li>
				<li>Type in your comment and click on the <strong class="bold">Comment</strong> button:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer255" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.11_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.11 – The Add Comment dialog box&#13;&#10;" width="987" height="207"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.11 – The Add Comment dialog box</p>
			<p>When the comment is published, it will float in the right margin near the comment, which <a id="_idIndexMarker283"/>will now be highlighted in a light yellow, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer256" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="callout">When there are many comments near each other, the comment boxes may not align with the commented text. Clicking on either the text that's highlighted or the comment box will align them.</p>
			<h3>Mentioning users in a Comment</h3>
			<p>When multiple students are working on a single Google Doc, it is possible to indicate who the <a id="_idIndexMarker284"/>comment is directed at. That student will then receive an email, indicating that they were mentioned in a comment. To reference a user, type in their email immediately after an <strong class="source-inline">@</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">+</strong> symbol (for example, <strong class="source-inline">@mzhang2@gtrainerdemo.technerdservices.com</strong>). An easier way of mentioning a student (or another user) in a comment is to start with an <strong class="source-inline">@</strong> or <strong class="source-inline">+</strong> symbol and immediately type in the user's name. Then, a drop-down list will appear for you to select an email address:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer257" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.13_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.13 – Mentioning another user in a comment&#13;&#10;" width="482" height="282"/>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.13 – Mentioning another user in a comment</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-84"><a id="_idTextAnchor083"/>Using the Comment bank</h2>
			<p>If you are like me and have several comments that are used over and over again, saving and retrieving <a id="_idIndexMarker285"/>comments from <strong class="bold">Comment bank</strong> will be a major time saver. At the time of writing, <strong class="bold">Comment bank</strong> is rudimentary, and there <a id="_idIndexMarker286"/>is no way to categorize comments or specify individual comments for an assignment. However, there is a search feature that helps with finding a specific comment when needed.</p>
			<h3>Creating a comment in the Comment bank</h3>
			<p>Follow these <a id="_idIndexMarker287"/>steps to create a <strong class="bold">Comment</strong> in the <strong class="bold">Comment bank</strong>:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In the Grading Tool, click on the <strong class="bold">Comment bank</strong> icon:<div id="_idContainer258" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_6.14_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.14 –The Comment bank icon&#13;&#10;" width="637" height="286"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.14 –The Comment bank icon</p></li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">+ Add to bank</strong> button:<div id="_idContainer259" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_6.15_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.15 – The Add to bank button&#13;&#10;" width="638" height="239"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.15 – The Add to bank button</p></li>
				<li>An <strong class="bold">Add comment</strong> dialog box will appear. Type in the comment and click the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> button:<div id="_idContainer260" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_6.16_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.16 – The Add comment dialog box&#13;&#10;" width="787" height="365"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.16 – The Add comment dialog box</p></li>
				<li>The <a id="_idIndexMarker288"/>comment will now appear in the <strong class="bold">Comment bank</strong> sidebar:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer261" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.17_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.17 – A finished comment saved in the Comment bank&#13;&#10;" width="653" height="437"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.17 – A finished comment saved in the Comment bank</p>
			<p>If you have already written the comment in a Google Doc, while in the Grading tool, click on the comment's kebab menu, which will have an option to add the comment to <strong class="bold">Comment bank</strong>.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Editing and Deleting Comments in the Comment Bank</p>
			<p class="callout">Each comment in <strong class="bold">Comment bank</strong> has a kebab menu with the option to copy the comment to the clipboard, edit the comment, or delete the comment. Another page to edit and delete comments can be found at <a href="https://classroom.google.com/g/cm">https://classroom.google.com/g/cm</a>.</p>
			<h3>Selecting comments in the Comment bank</h3>
			<p>There are several different methods to select a comment in <strong class="bold">Comment bank</strong> so that you can <a id="_idIndexMarker289"/>place it in a Google Doc comment. The simplest way to find the desired comment in <strong class="bold">Comment bank</strong> is to hover your mouse cursor over the desired comment, and then click the copy icon that appears in the comment box, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer262" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.18_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.18 – The Copy icon within a comment in the Comment bank&#13;&#10;" width="578" height="327"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.18 – The Copy icon within a comment in the Comment bank</p>
			<p>Now that the comment text has been copied, it can be pasted into a comment in the Google Doc. However, I find this method tedious and time-consuming when there are many comments stored in <strong class="bold">Comment bank</strong>. Finding the right comment may require a large amount of scrolling through it. Instead, I use the <strong class="bold">search Comment bank</strong> feature. To search through <strong class="bold">Comment bank</strong>, when starting a comment in a Google Doc, type the <strong class="source-inline">#</strong> symbol and words from the comment to add. Then, a drop-down menu will appear consisting of matching comments that were found in <strong class="bold">Comment bank</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer263" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.19_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.19 – Searching the Comment bank when adding a comment&#13;&#10;" width="499" height="270"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.19 – Searching the Comment bank when adding a comment</p>
			<p>After selecting a comment from <strong class="bold">Comment bank</strong> using this method, the <em class="italic">#</em> symbol will disappear <a id="_idIndexMarker290"/>from the comment text.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="bold">Comment bank</strong> does not work well with the private message section of the Grading Tool. While it is possible to copy and paste comments from <strong class="bold">Comment bank</strong> into the private message, starting the message with a <em class="italic">#</em> symbol will not search <strong class="bold">Comment bank</strong>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-85"><a id="_idTextAnchor084"/>Replying to and resolving comments</h2>
			<p>The comments feature in Google Docs allows anyone with editing permissions to reply to comments <a id="_idIndexMarker291"/>within the document. After the assignment <a id="_idIndexMarker292"/>is returned, students can then respond to your comments. To reply to a comment, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Select the comment by clicking on the highlighted comment or the comment box itself:<div id="_idContainer264" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_6.20_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.20 – Selecting the comment&#13;&#10;" width="1209" height="217"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.20 – Selecting the comment</p></li>
				<li>Click inside the <strong class="bold">Reply or add others with @</strong> field:<div id="_idContainer265" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_6.21_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.21 – The Reply or add others with @ field&#13;&#10;" width="436" height="297"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.21 – The Reply or add others with @ field</p></li>
				<li>Type <a id="_idIndexMarker293"/>your reply and click the <strong class="bold">Reply</strong> button:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer266" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.22_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.22 – Inserting text and the Reply button&#13;&#10;" width="437" height="373"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.22 – Inserting text and the Reply button</p>
			<p>By default, the <a id="_idIndexMarker294"/>owner of the document and the author of the comment will receive email notifications of the reply.</p>
			<p>If a comment is no longer needed, it can be hidden by resolving the comment. To resolve a comment, click on the checkmark icon of a comment, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer267" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.23_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.23 – The mark as resolved button&#13;&#10;" width="655" height="312"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.23 – The mark as resolved button</p>
			<p>Depending <a id="_idIndexMarker295"/>on your pedagogy, it may be important to instruct <a id="_idIndexMarker296"/>students in the class or in the comment to resolve the comment when they have addressed it. When comments are resolved, you will receive an email notification stating that the feedback comments have been addressed, and that the assignment is ready for reassessment.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-86"><a id="_idTextAnchor085"/>Managing comments in Google Docs</h2>
			<p>When you're working with several comments in a Google Doc, viewing all the comments in a single <a id="_idIndexMarker297"/>location saves you time scrolling <a id="_idIndexMarker298"/>through the entire text. In Google Docs, all comments, including resolved comments, are found in the <strong class="bold">comment history</strong> section. To view this <strong class="bold">comment history</strong>, click on the comment icon in the top-right corner of the Google Doc:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer268" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.24_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.24 – The comment history icon&#13;&#10;" width="532" height="149"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.24 – The comment history icon</p>
			<p>If you are in the Grading Tool and don't see the comment icon, expand the Google Docs menu by clicking on the icon to show the menus at the end of the toolbar:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer269" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.25_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.25 – The Show the Menus icon&#13;&#10;" width="443" height="104"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.25 – The Show the Menus icon</p>
			<p>At the top of the comment history, there is a <strong class="bold">Notifications</strong> menu, where you can select <a id="_idIndexMarker299"/>whether to receive email notifications <a id="_idIndexMarker300"/>for all comments, replies to your comments, or none. Beside the <strong class="bold">Notifications</strong> menu, there is another icon to add the comment. A screenshot of both icons is shown here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer270" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.26_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.26 – The Notifications and Add Comment buttons&#13;&#10;" width="507" height="370"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.26 – The Notifications and Add Comment buttons</p>
			<p>The comment history then scrolls through all the comments that had been found within the Google Doc. Clicking on any comment thread will scroll the document until it finds the comment's location within it. Within the comment history, students and teachers can view and create new replies. The following screenshot is an example of how a comment appears in the comment history:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer271" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.27_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.27 –  A comment inside Comment History&#13;&#10;" width="473" height="433"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.27 –  A comment inside Comment History</p>
			<p>Each comment <a id="_idIndexMarker301"/>has a drop-down menu that <a id="_idIndexMarker302"/>has options to edit, delete, resolve, or link to the comment. (If you are in the Grading tool, there will also be an option to add the comment to <strong class="bold">Comment bank</strong>.) Because the triangle icon for the drop-down menu can easily be missed, here's a screenshot of the menu:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer272" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.28_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.28 – The comment's drop-down menu&#13;&#10;" width="461" height="270"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.28 – The comment's drop-down menu</p>
			<p>If the comment has been resolved, then the drop-down menu will have an option to re-open instead of resolve the comment.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">The Usefulness of Linking to a Comment</p>
			<p class="callout">For longer papers such as post-secondary term papers or the extended essay for the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program, linking to a comment is a hidden gem. The link to this comment feature creates a web address directly to the comment. On multiple occasions, I have emailed comment links to students and collaborators so that they can easily navigate to the section of the paper the email is referencing.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-87"><a id="_idTextAnchor086"/>Suggesting changes to a student file</h2>
			<p>Another method of adding comments is to suggest changes that should be made to the text. Google <a id="_idIndexMarker303"/>Docs will record changes you make to the document. This method of feedback is great for providing feedback for sentence structure, wordiness, and conciseness in essays, lab reports, and other long documents. The suggesting feature is similar to <strong class="bold">Track Changes</strong> in Microsoft Word. To enable suggesting mode in a Google Doc, click on the editing icon and select <strong class="bold">Suggesting</strong>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer273" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.29_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.29 – The Editing mode icon and menu in the toolbar&#13;&#10;" width="342" height="263"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.29 – The Editing mode icon and menu in the toolbar</p>
			<p>Now, when you write in the document, it will display the changes and add a comment:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer274" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.30_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.30 – Suggesting changes in the text&#13;&#10;" width="932" height="217"/>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.30 – Suggesting changes in the text</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-88"><a id="_idTextAnchor087"/>Monitoring student progress with Version history</h2>
			<p>Depending on the type of assignments you're working with, there will be times where you <a id="_idIndexMarker304"/>may want to give feedback on the assignment's completion process, as well as the results. One example is to determine whether a student has modified the data that's been collected from <a id="_idIndexMarker305"/>an investigation after processing the data to calculate a more accurate result. Formally called <strong class="bold">Revision history</strong>, Version history takes snapshots of a Google Doc as content is added. It is a digital paper trail that allows you and your students to view previous versions of the document.</p>
			<p>While it saddens me, students do occasionally cheat on assignments. If you are suspicious of the authenticity of a written assignment that a student submits, checking the revision history of a document may provide clues as to whether the student copied and pasted a premade assignment into the document. To activate <strong class="bold">Version history</strong>, select <strong class="bold">Version history</strong> in the <strong class="bold">File</strong> menu and then click on the <strong class="bold">See version history</strong> option, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer275" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p>If the student wrote the assignment in Google Docs, there will be several versions in the right sidebar, and you will see highlighted text that the student has added within the version.

			<p class="callout">If a Google Doc's <strong class="bold">Version history</strong> only has a single version, the student may claim that the assignment was completed in Microsoft Word and then copy and pasted into the Google Doc. If that is the case, since 2016, Microsoft Word and other Office products also have a <strong class="bold">Version history</strong> feature.

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-89"><a id="_idTextAnchor088"/>Avoiding plagiarism with Originality reports</h2>
			<p>Instead <a id="_idIndexMarker307"/>of catching students in the act of cheating, Google Classroom offers a tool to detect and prevent plagiarism within a Google Doc. Originality reports check for authenticity by comparing student work to online sources (including digital versions of books). These reports identify parts of the assignment that relate to other online sources. Originality reports can also help educate students about plagiarism because they can run the report before submitting their assignment.</p>
			<p>In the student's view, there is a <strong class="bold">Run</strong> button in the <strong class="bold">Your work</strong> section of the assignment, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer277" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="callout-heading">Enterprise Advantages</p>
			<p class="callout">A Google Classroom Class can only use <strong class="bold">Originality reports</strong> in five assignments. A dialog box appears, displaying the number of remaining uses whenever this feature is turned on. If your organization uses Google Workspace for Education Enterprise, this limitation is removed.</p>
			<p>One strategy that some grade 10 teachers use for the first assignment is to enable Originality reports after students submit their work. (In the school system I am part of, grade 10 is the start of high school.) Then, they can build a mini-lesson wherein students can see <a id="_idIndexMarker309"/>whether the assignment has been flagged by the Originality report. Subsequent assignments will then have <strong class="bold">Originality reports</strong> turned on so that students can check whether their assignment contains plagiarism prior to submitting their work.</p>
			<p>To view an Originality report, click on the <strong class="bold">Check plagiarism link (originality)</strong> button under the file in the Grading tool. If <strong class="bold">Originality reports</strong> is enabled before students turn in their assignments, it will already show if the Originality reports had flagged any issues:</p>

			<p>Now, you <a id="_idIndexMarker310"/>know how to assign grades and publish feedback in private messages and comments. While these tools are an effective assessment practice, many assignments standardize assessments through a rubric, which we'll explore in the next section.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-90"><a id="_idTextAnchor089"/>Using a rubric to grade assignments</h1>
			<p>When you're <a id="_idIndexMarker311"/>grading long documents such as essays and lab reports, you may use a rubric to provide feedback to your students. In Google Classroom, rubrics can be created for individual assignments. This section will provide an overview of how to create and assess assignments using a rubric.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">TIP</p>
			<p class="callout">Oftentimes, I still include a rubric in the Google Doc instructions of the assignment, because <a id="_idIndexMarker312"/>students have provided feedback where it is easier to view the rubric within a Google Doc than through the Assignment post in Google Classroom.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-91"><a id="_idTextAnchor090"/>Creating a rubric in the Grading Tool</h2>
			<p>You can create a rubric while creating an Assignment post or you can add it to an Assignment <a id="_idIndexMarker313"/>post after publishing it. Oftentimes, I find myself adding it to the assignment afterward because the rubric is already within the assignment instruction's Google Doc. To create a rubric for an assignment, perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Whether you are creating a rubric while creating a new Assignment post or editing a previously created Assignment post, click the <strong class="bold">+ Rubric</strong> button below the <strong class="bold">Topic</strong> section of the right sidebar. Then, click <strong class="bold">Create rubric</strong>:<div id="_idContainer281" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_6.37_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.37 – Create rubric option of the Assignment post&#13;&#10;" width="602" height="510"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.37 – Create rubric option of the Assignment post</p></li>
				<li>By default, the rubric will have scoring enabled, where each criterion in the rubric is worth a set number of points, and the points are ordered in descending order. Set each property as needed:<div id="_idContainer282" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_6.38_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.38 – Score and score order settings&#13;&#10;" width="1040" height="243"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.38 – Score and score order settings</p><p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">It is possible to change whether scoring is enabled after students turn in an assessment. However, if scoring is disabled and some student assignments have already been graded, those assignment's rubric assessment scores will be lost.</p></li>
				<li>Type in the <strong class="bold">Criterion title</strong> and <strong class="bold">Criterion description</strong> properties. The criterion <a id="_idIndexMarker314"/>is the row of a rubric. In a Science lab report, these are often the sections of the lab report, such as observations, calculations, and so on. On the other hand, in English papers, these criteria are often components of the essay, such as ideas, grammar, and cohesiveness:<div id="_idContainer283" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_6.39_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.39 – The Criterion title and description fields&#13;&#10;" width="547" height="192"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.39 – The Criterion title and description fields</p></li>
				<li>Type in the <strong class="bold">Points</strong>, <strong class="bold">Level title</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Description</strong> properties for the first level of the criterion. The levels are the columns of the rubric. Oftentimes, these columns represent points that have been awarded or descriptors such as <strong class="bold">Exemplary</strong>, <strong class="bold">Proficient</strong>, <strong class="bold">Adequate</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Limited</strong>:<div id="_idContainer284" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_6.40_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.40 – The Criterion level points, title, and description&#13;&#10;" width="617" height="638"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.40 – The Criterion level points, title, and description</p></li>

			<p>There are <a id="_idIndexMarker319"/>alternative methods of creating a rubric that reuse a previously created rubric or import a template from Google Sheets. You will learn how to do this in the <em class="italic">Reusing a rubric from another Assignment post</em> section later in the chapter.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-92"><a id="_idTextAnchor092"/>Grading an assignment using a rubric</h2>
			<p>When assessing student submissions for an assignment with a rubric, much of the grading will <a id="_idIndexMarker320"/>occur in the Grading tool. The right sidebar will sandwich the rubric between assigning a grade and leaving a private comment. Each criterion appears collapsed with a gray box to indicate each level of the rubric. Clicking on the title of a criterion will expand it so that you can view the text within each level. The following is a screenshot of the rubric in the Grading tool:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer292" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.48_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.48 – The rubric in the Grading Tool&#13;&#10;" width="980" height="730"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.48 – The rubric in the Grading Tool</p>
			<p>To grade <a id="_idIndexMarker321"/>with a rubric in the Grading tool, click on the appropriate level, either expanded or collapsed, for each criterion. The selected levels are highlighted in blue:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer293" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.49_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.49 – Selecting and deselecting criterion levels&#13;&#10;" width="654" height="612"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.49 – Selecting and deselecting criterion levels</p>
			<p>If the rubric uses points, the criterion points will accumulate at the top of the rubric. If the total <a id="_idIndexMarker322"/>points of the rubric are not the same as the total points of the assignment, the assignment grade will automatically adjust from the rubric points to the assignment points. For example, <strong class="bold">17/20</strong> will adjust to <strong class="bold">8.5/10</strong> for the <strong class="bold">Bean Sprout Lab</strong>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer294" class="IMG---Figure">

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.50 – Rubric points being converted into assignment points</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">After grading with a rubric, the grade can be adjusted afterward. In the preceding example, if your pedagogy does not use part marks, then the grade can be changed to an <strong class="bold">8</strong> or <strong class="bold">9</strong>. However, making any changes to the rubric will recalculate the grade from the rubric.</p>
			<p>When marking with the Grading tool, using all its features effectively can dramatically speed up the marking process. Oftentimes, I print a copy of the rubric for reference and then use <a id="_idIndexMarker323"/>comments in the comment bank, select levels from the rubric, and then write a sentence or two in the private comments to grade and provide feedback. Then, in the Grading tool, I will navigate to the next student and repeat this process. While it seems daunting, with a little preparation in <strong class="bold">Comment bank</strong> and the assignment rubric (and a peppy Spotify playlist and a fun drink), the marking process can be enjoyable.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-93"><a id="_idTextAnchor093"/>Reusing a rubric from another Assignment post</h2>

			<p>Google Classroom will save a PDF file containing the annotations you've made and attach it to the assignment's submission:</p>

			<p>To make <a id="_idIndexMarker339"/>additional annotations, open the PDF file. This method <a id="_idIndexMarker340"/>of providing feedback is the closest to traditional pen and paper, and it's considerably lighter to take home too!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-96"><a id="_idTextAnchor096"/>Viewing all student grades</h1>
			<p>As assignments <a id="_idIndexMarker341"/>are taken in and graded, often, you will want to see an overview of your students' achievement. Traditionally called a gradebook or marksheet, Google Classroom has a tab titled <strong class="bold">Grades</strong> where you can view the class gradebook, as follows:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer316" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.72_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.72 – The Grades page in Google Classroom&#13;&#10;" width="1274" height="525"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.72 – The Grades page in Google Classroom</p>
			<p>In this gradebook, each assignment has a kebab menu that contains options to edit, delete, or return <a id="_idIndexMarker342"/>all submissions. For each student, you can modify any assignment grade; view any assignment, which will open the Grading Tool; or return an assignment submission:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer317" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_6.73_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 6.73 – Kebab menu for individual student assignment submissions&#13;&#10;" width="1091" height="286"/>

			<p>Google is <a id="_idIndexMarker343"/>working on integrating Google Classroom with a wide range of <strong class="bold">Student Information Systems</strong> (<strong class="bold">SIS</strong>) so that grades can be easily imported into other tools. If your school district is using a compatible SIS, head on over to <a href="B16846_09_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor117"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Customizing to Your Subject</em>, for additional steps on setting up weighted categories.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-97"><a id="_idTextAnchor097"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, you learned about the grading and assignment feedback features within Google Classroom. Then, you enhanced those features with the commenting and suggesting features found within Google Docs. Next, you learned about Google Doc's <strong class="bold">Version history</strong>, which you can use to view previous snapshots of a Google Doc.</p>
			<p>The latter half of this chapter focused on grading with a rubric. Here, you learned how to create and grade assignments with a rubric. Additional methods of creating a rubric by reusing one or importing a Google Sheet were also explored.</p>
			<p>Finally, we learned how to mark up a student submission using a pen-enabled tablet and the Google Classroom app, which creates PDFs of your annotations on the Google Doc. This is akin to traditional paper marking techniques.</p>
			<p>Because this chapter explored many methods of providing feedback for written assignments, it is important that you take the time to evaluate which methods work best in your assessment workflow. You do not need to use each method to provide effective feedback and often, less is more. After assessing a handful of assignments with your preferred method, it will become more natural and intuitive. </p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will explore how to use Google Forms to create multiple choice, numeric, and fill-in-the-blank questions. These forms can then be converted into quizzes that Google Classroom can grade.</p>
