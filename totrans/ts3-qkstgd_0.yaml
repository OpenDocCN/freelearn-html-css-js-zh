- en: This quick start guide is a book that covers every topic related to TypeScript.
    This book takes the reader through all the features and benefits of using TypeScript.
    With this guide, you will grow your typing skills, which will make your JavaScript
    knowledge in play. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. This book does not
    teach you how to do web programming but illustrates how to use TypeScript on top
    of a language that you already know and like.

- en: '[Chapter 1](e45856f0-cecc-4d35-a781-e1102e9a2a86.xhtml), *Getting Started with
    TypeScript*, covers how to bring TypeScript into a new project or an existing
    JavaScript project. We will see how to set up your environment in your current
    build setup. TypeScript is supported by a variety of build tools, such as Grunt,
    Gulp, Webpack, or simply using the CLI. We also dive into the essential options,
    among all the ones that are available, to help you get started with TypeScript.'

    with Primitive, *illustrates scoping a variable, the subtlety between undefined
    variables and null variables, and how to make a variable optional or required. At
    the end of this chapter, the reader will be in a situation where all the variables
    will be declared properly with an type that''s accurate supported by TypeScript.
    The distinction between a primitive and non-primitive type will not be a conundrum
    anymore. The use of enum or symbol will be natural, and the creation of new types
    will become a habit any time a new domain object is introduced in your system.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](46547c1e-e77b-4ae2-a5ea-323877652eb3.xhtml), *Unleashing the Power
    of Type with Objects, *illustrates the difference between an object, Object, object
    literal and an object built with a constructor. This chapter also introduces the
    notion of a union between types that will allow an infinite combination of types
    for a single value. Furthermore, the concept of intersection is introduced, which
    allows us to manipulate type differently. At the end of this chapter, the reader
    will be able to create complex combinations of objects that hold advanced structures.
    We will dissect how to create a dictionary with a strongly typed index signature,
    understand how type can be beneficial with a map, and how to use the right object
    in order to be as accurate as possible when defining an object that can have a
    broad reach.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](f4b5f5e8-8a6d-40a8-a470-aaaf11ba9cd4.xhtml), *Transforming Your
    Code in Object-Oriented, *explains that object-oriented programming has its own
    set of terminology, and TypeScript relies on many of them. In this chapter, all
    the concepts of object-oriented programming that TypeScript supports are discussed
    with examples. We will see what a class is and how to instantiate a class into
    an object. In the same vein, we will see how a constructor can be strongly typed
    with TypeScript, but also how with a shorthand syntax we can assign a class''s
    fields directly from the constructor. The principle of encapsulation with visibility,
    how to implement an interface, and how to bring abstraction to a class are all
    covered.'

    with Different Patterns,* covers the subtlety the most basic concept, which is
    the variable. Knowing the exact type from a primitive to an object is essential
    for accessing specific members. Scoping down the exact type at runtime and design
    time is crucial for consistency between the two environments and to have feedback
    about what is possible or not. The variety of configuration among the different
    types of variable requires many different patterns that are covered in this chapter.'

    Generic, *builds on ideas introduced in the previous chapters. The chapter builds
    these ideas by enhancing type and making them generic. Basic topics, such as defining
    a generic class and interface, are present. Through the chapter, we move into
    more advanced topics, such as generic constraints. The goal of this chapter is
    to make your code more generic to increase the reusability of your classes, functions,
    and structures to reduce the burden of duplicating code.'

- en: '[Chapter 7](90ccf909-c665-4e2f-8df6-13aa9723db20.xhtml), *Mastering the Art
    of Defining Types,* covershow to create type from libraries that we are not working
    directly with but by importing the library inside your TypeScript project. The
    main difference is that when consuming code outside your project, you will not
    directly use TypeScript code but their definition. The reason is that JavaScript
    is provided in those libraries, not TypeScript code. We will see how it is possible
    to master the art of creating definition files for code that does not provide
    them, allowing you to keep working in a strong environment.'
