- en: Single-page, client-side JavaScript frameworks may possibly be the future of
    the Web. Client-side frameworks have matured a lot in the last few years. They've
    made creating web applications easier and more responsive. Ember.js has been one
    of the leading frameworks behind this movement.

- en: This book provides in-depth explanations of how to use the Ember.js framework
    to take you from being a beginner to an expert. You'll start with the basics,
    and by the end of the book, you'll have a solid foundation in creating real-time
    web applications in Ember.

- en: We'll begin by explaining key points on how to use the Ember.js framework and
    associated tools. You'll learn how to use Ember CLI effectively and how to create
    and deploy your application. We'll take a close look at the Ember object model
    and templates by looking at bindings and observers. We'll move on to Ember components
    and models and Ember Data. Next, we'll look at testing with integration and acceptance
    tests using QUnit. Afterward, we'll take a look at authentication and services
    and working with Ember add-ons. We'll explore advanced topics such as services
    and initializers and how to use them together to build real-time applications.
