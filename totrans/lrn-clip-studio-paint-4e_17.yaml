- en: Auto actions are an amazing feature of digital art. They can simplify your workflow
    and save you time and effort when creating your drawings. What are auto actions?
    Auto actions are sets of recorded steps that can be played back, automating a
    task or tasks and completing them with the press of a button.
  prefs: []

- en: 'What sorts of tasks can be made into an auto action? **Scenario 1**: we have
    a blank manga page, and to start creating art on it, we need a panel layer folder
    (we can divide the panel later), a sketch layer named *Sketch*, an ink layer named
    *Ink* or *Line art*, background layers named *Background 1* and *Background 2*,
    grayscale layers to add shading named *Gray 1* and *Gray 2*, a highlight layer
    named *Highlight*, and a sound effect layer named *SE*. Auto action can do all
    of this in one click. **Scenario 2**: we have a blank canvas on which we want
    to create a color character drawing. We need a sketch layer named *Sketch*, an
    ink layer named *Ink*, a skin color layer named *Skin*, a skin details layer named
    *Skin 2* that has got a clipping mask to the skin layer below, and more… Again,
    auto action can do all of this in one click. Not only this, though; it can do
    just about anything that you can dream up!'

    and the steps that they consist of. The first column (the one that has all the

    are able to be played. If the checkbox is empty, then that step or action will
    not play.

    effect layer on the left has had the **Bright colors emit light (glow)** action
    applied to it, which you can see in the result on the right, making the white

    this chapter, cuts out a selected area from the active layer and pastes it on
    a new layer. As you can see in *Figure 17.8*, you can move the hair part from
    the **flats** layer with one click of the **Play Action** button.

    one Command Bar shortcut! This is an easy process and will cut down the amount
    of time you spend going through palettes, trying to find the commands that you
    use most often. Let’s look at both of these processes to create easy access to
    our auto actions.

    using recorded auto actions to automate their steps. We looked at the **Auto Action**
    palette and learned how to play a default action. We learned how to create a new
    auto action set, how to create a new auto action and record the steps for it,
    and then how to download an auto action asset. Finally, we learned how to create
    two different shortcuts to an auto action in order to make accessing it easier.
