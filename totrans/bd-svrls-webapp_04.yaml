- en: The frontend is the easiest layer to go serverless. You just need a service
    to host your website's static files, and the user's browser will download the
    files, render the pages and execute the client-side JavaScript code. On AWS, the
    service we will use to host the frontend pages is Amazon S3\. In this chapter,
    you'll also learn how to configure and optimize your website by adding a CDN and
    the supporting HTTPS connections.

    is fully managed by AWS. In this section, we are going to use S3 to host our website
    static files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images. You will see that this

    request additional data to the *backend* code, which will be hosted and executed

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are four common ways to handle errors using S3\. I will explain the options
    you have, but before I do that, let me define what I mean by "handling errors".
    When a user makes an HTTP request, S3 may fail to get the answer and it will return
    a status code to explain the failure. An HTTP 500 *Internal Server Error* could
    be a possible result, but it would be extremely rare and odd. However, S3 returning
    either a 404 *Not Found* or 403 *Forbidden* error is pretty common.
  id: totrans-33
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 404 *Not Found* is an error that will be returned when the user browses your
    website for a page that does not exist. For example, if you have a page named
    `company.io/about` and the user incorrectly browses `company.io/abot`, S3 won't
    be able to find the `abot.html` file and will return a 404 error. Another example
    is when you use a JavaScript framework to create a **Single-Page Application**
    (**SPA**). Although your frontend code knows how to serve the `/about` page, the
    framework will not create a physical `about.html` file to upload to S3, and a
    404 error will be returned even when browsing `company.io/about`.
  id: totrans-34
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We are going to discuss SPA in [Chapter 5](6cb9ccdc-61f3-437d-81ac-d05ec652f1a4.xhtml),
    *Building the Frontend*. For the time being, note that an SPA can serve multiple
    pages, but there is only one complete HTML file, named `index.html` file.
  id: totrans-35
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 403 *Forbidden* is an error that happens when the bucket has restricted permissions.
    If the bucket doesn't allow access to *everyone* or there is a specific file with
    restricted access, the 403 error will be returned. In my opinion, I prefer to
    consider *all* the files within the bucket public. If there is a page that shouldn't
    be public, showing the HTML file should not be a problem. The objective is to
    protect the *data* and not the *layout*. Setting authorization and data visibility
    is something that needs to be handled on the server side, not the client side.
    Also, if there are static files that must remain private, such as photos, you
    can save them in another bucket instead of reusing the bucket that was created
    to host the website. These *photos* can be considered *data* and, likewise, need
    to be controlled by the backend with special care.
  id: totrans-36
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    need not worry so much about strange S3 errors, the only problem that we need
    to handle now is 404 errors.

    be replaced by `company.io/#!/about` and the `index.html` file will be returned.
    If you have an SPA, it can identify which page needs to be displayed and render
    it correctly. If the page doesn't exist, it will be able to render a generic 404
    page. Also, you can configure HTML5's pushState to remove the hashbang sign (`#!`)
    after the page loads, but it will make the page to blink.
  id: totrans-41

  id: totrans-43
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead of setting a redirection rule, you can set an error document with `index.html`.
    This is the easiest solution for SPAs. When the user requests an `/about` page
    that doesn't have a physical `about.html` file to match, the `index.html` file
    is loaded and the SPA reads the address and understands that it needs to serve
    the contents of the `/about` page.
  id: totrans-44
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This configuration is what we have done in the previous image and it works pretty
    well without polluting the URL address with `#!` and without blinking the page
    when loading. However, search engines may refuse to index your website because,
    when browsing the `/about` page, the result's `body` message will be set using
    the correct page, but the `status code` will still be set as 404\. If the Google
    crawler sees a 404 error, it will understand that the page doesn't exist and the
    page content is probably a generic error page.

    setting that allows you to change the status code of the `response` object. In
    this case, we can configure CloudFront to act on 404 errors, returning S3's `index.html`
    file and modifying the `status code` to `200 *OK*` instead of returning 404.

    (**SEO**) is not considered, because they require JavaScript to be enabled in
    the browser to render the correct page. Since most web crawlers can't execute
    JavaScript code, they will not be able to index the webpage. This problem is solved
    with prerendering.
  id: totrans-50
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    technique creates physical pages for SPA routes. For example, in an SPA, the `/about`
    page doesn't have an `about.html` file, but with prerendering, you will be able
    to create it.
  id: totrans-51

    will be no need to worry about 404 errors. If the page exist, S3 will find an
    HTML file for it. We still need to configure the error document to `index.html` to
    handle pages that doesn't exist, but we don't need to configure CloudFront to
    force the status code 200.

    should be your website's main one. One issue with using naked domains is that
    if your site has cookies, then placing static files in a subdomain, such as `static.example.com`,
    will not be optimized because each browser request for static files will automatically
    send cookies that were created for `example.com`. If your login happens at `www.example.com`,
    you can place static content inside `static.example.com` without worrying about
