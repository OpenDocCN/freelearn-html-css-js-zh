			<p>Google Classroom shines when it comes to organizing information between the teacher and students. However, parents and guardians are important stakeholders in this communication too. Google Classroom can send email summaries to parents invited as guardians within Google Classroom. This method must be enabled by the school or district's IT department. If your school or district uses another method of communication with parents, they may leave this feature disabled because of its inherent security risks. (For example, my current school employer disabled Google Classroom's guardian emails so that emails can undergo a verification process within an in-house system.)</p>
			<p>If your school does not allow guardian emails, by using Google Calendar, you are still able to inform guardians about important due dates from Google Classroom. Back in <a href="B16846_01_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Getting to Know Google Classroom</em>, I mentioned that each class created in Google Classroom has a Google Calendar created for the question and assignment due dates. This chapter will explore how to use guardian emails within Google Classroom and the class's Google Calendar to communicate with parents and guardians.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">For the rest of this chapter, <em class="italic">parents</em> will refer to both parents and guardians.</p>
			<p>Before diving into this topic, each school district is different in how it provides information to parents. Therefore, you may have to adapt the information you find in this chapter to best suit your school district's online resources. For example, in my school district, administrators, teachers, parents, and students are all included in an intranet designed for communication between stakeholders.</p>
			<p>Not only is there classroom-specific information, but the school can also post announcements of major events and deadlines to this intranet. I have also worked in school districts where the only means of communication with parents is through the school website. Therefore, this chapter will explore using the guardian emails feature and two different methods of keeping parents in the loop with Google Calendar: using Google Calendar website and using Google Sites to create a class-specific website.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Enabling and inviting parents to receive notifications from Google Classroom</li>
				<li>Activating sharing for the Google Calendar and identifying its website URL</li>
				<li>Creating a Google Site and embedding the Google Calendar into the web page</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-111"><a id="_idTextAnchor111"/>Inviting parents to receive guardian emails</h1>
			<p>Guardian emails <a id="_idIndexMarker405"/>provide parents with daily or weekly email summaries of upcoming assignment deadlines and announcements, as <a id="_idIndexMarker406"/>well as highlighting outstanding assignments not yet turned in on Google Classroom. To enable and invite parents to receive guardian emails, use the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Click on the settings gear:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.1_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.1 – Google Classroom's settings gear&#13;&#10;" width="529" height="197"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.1 – Google Classroom's settings gear</p></li>
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">General</strong> section, click on the switch for <strong class="bold">Guardian summaries</strong>:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.2_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.2 – The Guardian summaries switch in the General section&#13;&#10;" width="886" height="368"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.2 – The Guardian summaries switch in the General section</p></li>
				<li>A dialog box will <a id="_idIndexMarker407"/>appear requesting confirmation. It will also <a id="_idIndexMarker408"/>have a checkbox to activate guardian emails in all the other classes:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.3_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.3 – Guardian summaries dialog box&#13;&#10;" width="351" height="299"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.3 – Guardian summaries dialog box</p></li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Save</strong> button to save and exit the settings:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.4_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.4 – Save button for Settings&#13;&#10;" width="1034" height="271"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.4 – Save button for Settings</p></li>
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Student</strong> list of the <strong class="bold">People</strong> page, click on <strong class="bold">Invite guardians</strong>:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.5_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.5 – Invite guardians' button in the Student list&#13;&#10;" width="887" height="52"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.5 – Invite guardians' button in the Student list</p></li>
				<li>In the dialog box, type in the <a id="_idIndexMarker409"/>parent email and <a id="_idIndexMarker410"/>click on <strong class="bold">SEARCH RESULTS</strong>:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.6_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.6 – Invite guardians dialog box&#13;&#10;" width="513" height="256"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.6 – Invite guardians dialog box</p></li>
				<li>If necessary, add additional guardian emails and then click on the <strong class="bold">Invite</strong> button:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.7_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.7 – Invite button in the Invite guardians dialog box&#13;&#10;" width="531" height="242"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.7 – Invite button in the Invite guardians dialog box</p></li>
				<li>The invited <a id="_idIndexMarker411"/>email address will be displayed beside the guardian name until the parent accepts the invitation as shown here:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.8_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.8 – Guardian email that is invited but not confirmed&#13;&#10;" width="887" height="70"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.8 – Guardian email that is invited but not confirmed</p></li>
				<li>Once the parent <a id="_idIndexMarker412"/>accepts the invitation, the parent's name will appear instead of their email address, as shown here:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.9_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.9 – Confirmed guardian email&#13;&#10;" width="887" height="63"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.9 – Confirmed guardian email</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">If a parent uses an email that is not linked to a Google account, they will be redirected to an account creation page that can link their non-Google email to an account.</p>
			<p>For parents to access their email notifications settings, direct <a id="_idIndexMarker413"/>them to Google Classroom's website (<a href="https://classroom.google.com/gs">https://classroom.google.com/gs</a>). Google Classroom will display the student and allow them to change between receiving email notifications daily, weekly, or not at all. An example of the guardian settings is as follows:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.10_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.10 – Guardian summaries settings&#13;&#10;" width="858" height="497"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.10 – Guardian summaries settings</p>
			<p>Next, we will <a id="_idIndexMarker414"/>look at how <a id="_idIndexMarker415"/>to manually send emails to guardians.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-112"><a id="_idTextAnchor112"/>Sending emails to guardians manually</h2>
			<p>Guardian emails allow <a id="_idIndexMarker416"/>teachers to send an email to all guardians within a class. A new <strong class="bold">Email all guardians</strong> button appears at the top of the <strong class="bold">Students</strong> list, as shown here:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.11_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.11 – Email all guardians button in the Students list&#13;&#10;" width="875" height="267"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.11 – Email all guardians button in the Students list</p>
			<p>In addition, the three-dot menu beside each student in the student list contains options to email the student's guardian, invite additional guardians, or remove current ones. An example of this menu is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.12_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.12 – Email the guardians of a single student from the Student list&#13;&#10;" width="950" height="258"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.12 – Email the guardians of a single student from the Student list</p>
			<p>Using guardian emails is <a id="_idIndexMarker417"/>one of the easiest methods of connecting with parents. Once they sign up, parents will continue to receive summary emails. Furthermore, they only need to sign up once. Therefore, if parents sign up for guardian emails in their child's early school years, they will continue to receive summary emails throughout their child's school experience.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-113"><a id="_idTextAnchor113"/>Sharing Google Calendar with a URL</h1>
			<p>Sharing the Google Calendar of a class is an alternative to the guardian emails if they are unavailable within your district. If your <a id="_idIndexMarker418"/>school district already has a web page or an intranet that connects the school with parents, this method may be the simplest one to deploy. Since parents already have a website to go to for school information, it is easiest for them to find the link to your calendar on the school website.</p>
			<p>Before we include that link, we must make sure that the calendar associated with your classroom is publicly available by following these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> section, click on the <strong class="bold">Google Calendar</strong> button:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.13_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.13 – Google Calendar button&#13;&#10;" width="772" height="143"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.13 – Google Calendar button</p></li>
				<li>On the left sidebar, you will see a <a id="_idIndexMarker419"/>list of calendars. Hover your mouse over the calendar with the same name as your Google Classroom class and click on the Kebab menu:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.14_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.14 – Calendar Kebab menu&#13;&#10;" width="544" height="205"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.14 – Calendar Kebab menu</p><p>If you do not see a list of calendars under the <strong class="bold">My Calendars</strong> heading, click on the sideways triangle beside the heading as shown here:</p><div><img src="img/Figure_8.15_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.15 – Expand icon for My calendars&#13;&#10;" width="430" height="89"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.15 – Expand icon for My calendars</p></li>
				<li>Click on <strong class="bold">Settings and sharing</strong>:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.16_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.16 – Settings and sharing option&#13;&#10;" width="550" height="444"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.16 – Settings and sharing option</p></li>
				<li>Under the <strong class="bold">Access permissions</strong> section, check <a id="_idIndexMarker420"/>the checkbox beside <strong class="bold">Make available to public</strong>. The drop-down menu beside this option should also be <strong class="bold">See all event details</strong>:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.17_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.17 – Make available to public checkbox&#13;&#10;" width="667" height="158"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.17 – Make available to public checkbox</p></li>
				<li>A warning box will appear. Click the <strong class="bold">OK</strong> button to confirm:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.18_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.18 – Warning box for calendar sharing&#13;&#10;" width="620" height="197"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.18 – Warning box for calendar sharing</p></li>
				<li>Click the <strong class="bold">Get shareable link</strong> button:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.19_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.19 – Button for the calendar link&#13;&#10;" width="771" height="241"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.19 – Button for the calendar link</p></li>
				<li>A dialog box will appear <a id="_idIndexMarker421"/>with the calendar link. Click the <strong class="bold">Copy link</strong> button:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.20_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.20 – Dialog box for the calendar link&#13;&#10;" width="700" height="188"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.20 – Dialog box for the calendar link</p></li>
				<li>Distribute the link to parents. When they click on the link, it will open a dialog box in Google Calendar to add the calendar, as shown here:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.21_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.21 – Dialog box to add a calendar to Google Calendar&#13;&#10;" width="730" height="338"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.21 – Dialog box to add a calendar to Google Calendar</p>
			<p>Now that you have the calendar link, you can send it to whoever manages your school website or add it to the school intranet. In my school district's intranet, I include the link in the <strong class="bold">Homework</strong> section. I create an assignment that lasts until the end of the year and then include a message and the calendar link. The message usually explains to the parents that they can click on the calendar link to view their child's upcoming important dates for my class in Google Calendar. </p>
			<p>The calendar link from the <a id="_idIndexMarker422"/>preceding instructions requires the parents to have a Google account. As part of the explanation to parents, I provide additional instructions for parents that do not use Google products. I include an additional calendar URL found in the <strong class="bold">Integrate calendar</strong> section of the calendar settings. The public URL shown in the following figure displays the calendar as a web page and does not require an account to view:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.22_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.22 – Calendar website address&#13;&#10;" width="835" height="217"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.22 – Calendar website address</p>
			<p>Given here is an example of the calendar in an internet browser:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.23_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.23 – Google Calendar web page&#13;&#10;" width="1650" height="831"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.23 – Google Calendar web page</p>
			<p>There has been no update to the <a id="_idIndexMarker423"/>Google Calendar web page. The next section explores how to embed the classroom calendar into a Google Sites website. Not only will the calendar look more modern, but you can add additional content to the website too. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-114"><a id="_idTextAnchor114"/>Creating a website for Google Calendar</h1>
			<p>If your school district does not <a id="_idIndexMarker424"/>have an easy method for communicating with parents online, you can use Google Sites to create a website for parents to access information from your class. Google Sites is a <em class="italic">what-you-see-is-what-you-get</em> website editor that allows you to create websites without using code. While sending a link home with <a id="_idIndexMarker425"/>your students for a single calendar may be enough for your needs, Google Sites allows you to customize your Google Calendars, have multiple calendars visible on a single page, and make content from other Google apps accessible to parents.</p>
			<p>Other uses for Google Sites include a more permanent location for classroom content. Several teachers at my school still use their course Google Site created before Google Classroom was available, thereby having a single location where students and parents have access to all class content.</p>
			<p>Since this book focuses on Google Classroom, this section will provide steps to add the Google Classroom calendar to a Google Site. There are a plethora of other features found within Google Sites that are beyond the scope of this book.</p>
			<p>Use the following steps to create a Google Site and add the Classroom's Google Calendar to it:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In the app launcher, click on the <strong class="bold">Sites</strong> icon. If there is no icon, open Google Chrome and navigate to <a href="https://sites.google.com/new">https://sites.google.com/new</a>:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.24_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.24 – Sites icon in the app launcher&#13;&#10;" width="421" height="565"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.24 – Sites icon in the app launcher</p></li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Blank</strong> template in <a id="_idIndexMarker426"/>the start a <a id="_idIndexMarker427"/>new site section:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.25_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.25 – Blank template icon in Google Sites&#13;&#10;" width="721" height="380"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.25 – Blank template icon in Google Sites</p></li>
				<li>Title the Google Site. The name in the top-left corner is the filename for the site and can be different from the title in the banner, which is what parents and other site visitors will see:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.26_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.26 – Site filename and title&#13;&#10;" width="1218" height="324"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.26 – Site filename and title</p></li>
				<li>On the <a id="_idIndexMarker428"/>right sidebar, scroll down to <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> on the default <strong class="bold">Insert</strong> tab:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.27_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.27 – The Calendar option in the sidebar&#13;&#10;" width="859" height="254"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.27 – The Calendar option in the sidebar</p></li>
				<li>A list of <a id="_idIndexMarker429"/>Google Calendars will appear in the sidebar. Select the calendar linked to the Classroom Class:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.28_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.28 – List of Google Calendars&#13;&#10;" width="310" height="301"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.28 – List of Google Calendars</p><p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">To combine multiple Google Calendars into a single calendar, select multiple calendars.</p></li>
				<li>Click the <strong class="bold">INSERT</strong> button at the <a id="_idIndexMarker430"/>bottom of the sidebar:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.29_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.29 – Insert button for adding a Google Calendar&#13;&#10;" width="854" height="359"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.29 – Insert button for adding a Google Calendar</p></li>
				<li>Using the <a id="_idIndexMarker431"/>blue dots around the calendar, resize it:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.30_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.30 – Frame resizing markers&#13;&#10;" width="978" height="606"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.30 – Frame resizing markers</p></li>
				<li>By default, Google Sites inserts a Google Calendar in the agenda view mode. To change this default view and other settings of the calendar, click on the settings gear of the calendar:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.31_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.31 – Calendar settings gear&#13;&#10;" width="465" height="258"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.31 – Calendar settings gear</p></li>
				<li>The calendar <a id="_idIndexMarker432"/>settings dialog box will appear. You can adjust <a id="_idIndexMarker433"/>these settings to your preference. These steps will change <strong class="bold">View Mode</strong> to <strong class="bold">Month</strong>. Don't forget to click the <strong class="bold">Done</strong> button to save changes:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.32_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.32 – View Mode in Calendar Settings&#13;&#10;" width="404" height="472"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.32 – View Mode in Calendar Settings</p></li>
				<li>Your Google Classroom's calendar is now visible on a Google Site, displayed here. The final step is to make the Google Site visible so that parents and the public can view the site:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.33_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.33 – Preview of the complete Google Site with Google Calendar&#13;&#10;" width="1172" height="361"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.33 – Preview of the complete Google Site with Google Calendar</p>
			<p>Now that we have <a id="_idIndexMarker434"/>created a website, let's look at how <a id="_idIndexMarker435"/>we can share this site.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-115"><a id="_idTextAnchor115"/>Sharing the Google Site</h2>
			<p>To make the <a id="_idIndexMarker436"/>Google Site visible to the public, use these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Click on the <strong class="bold">Publish</strong> button:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.34_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.34 – Publish button&#13;&#10;" width="718" height="255"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.34 – Publish button</p></li>
				<li>The web address is the ending of the website URL. While it is possible to change it later, any stakeholders who have bookmarked the page will need to update their bookmarks. Update the web address if necessary and then click the <strong class="bold">MANAGE</strong> link:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.35_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.35 – Publish your site dialog box&#13;&#10;" width="510" height="303"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.35 – Publish your site dialog box</p></li>
				<li>Another <a id="_idIndexMarker437"/>dialog box will appear. In the <strong class="bold">Links</strong> section, click on the <strong class="bold">Change</strong> link:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.36_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.36 – Site sharing dialog box&#13;&#10;" width="522" height="304"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.36 – Site sharing dialog box</p></li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Links</strong> section will expand. Click on the drop-down menu for the <strong class="bold">Published</strong> site and select <strong class="bold">Public</strong>:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.37_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.37 – Published site visibility drop-down menu&#13;&#10;" width="635" height="398"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.37 – Published site visibility drop-down menu</p></li>

				<li>Back in the <strong class="bold">Publish your site</strong> dialog box, a new <a id="_idIndexMarker438"/>checkbox will appear.

Click on the <strong class="bold">Publish</strong> button to the Google Site:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.39_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.39 – Search settings checkbox&#13;&#10;" width="453" height="336"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.39 – Search settings checkbox</p></li>
				<li>Use the link icon to copy the website URL to distribute to parents:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.40_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 8.40 – Google Site link icon&#13;&#10;" width="501" height="111"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.40 – Google Site link icon</p></li>
				<li>When anyone clicks on the link, they will be sent to your Google Site as shown here:</li>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.41 – Screenshot of the published Google Site</p>
			<p>Now that you have <a id="_idIndexMarker439"/>added the Class calendar and published the Google Site, you can add additional content from the sidebar. Experiment with adding section headers, text, images, Google Docs, YouTube videos, and more! Many teachers use a Google Site to store content that they use year on year in addition to their Google Classrooms. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-116"><a id="_idTextAnchor116"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>With guardian emails and Google Calendar, the parents of your students will be able to view the question and assignment posts within your classes. While implementing either of these features may seem time-consuming to set up, it occurs at the beginning of the year or semester and requires little maintenance throughout the year. Now that you are able to invite parents or guardians to receive email notifications, you can share Google Classroom calendars with parents through a URL or a Google Site.</p>
			<p>Parents will be able to actively engage with their children's assignments and assessments. Now that parents can view posts in Google Classroom, where you can manage and grade their assignments, it unifies much of the administration and management aspects of the classroom so that you can focus on teaching.</p>
			<p>The next chapter explores additional features in Classroom and third-party apps that can enhance your activities within Google Classroom.</p>
