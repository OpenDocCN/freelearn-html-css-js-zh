- en: Microservices are a popular architectural style for building scalable, resilient,
    and adaptable applications. They allow developers to decompose a complex system
    into smaller, independent, and loosely coupled services that communicate through
    well-defined interfaces. Microservices enable faster delivery, easier testing,
    and greater flexibility in choosing the right technologies for each service.

- en: Node.js is a powerful and versatile platform for building microservices. It
    offers a fast and lightweight runtime environment, a rich set of libraries and
    frameworks, and a vibrant and supportive community. Node.js enables developers
    to write microservices in JavaScript, a ubiquitous and expressive language that
    runs on any platform. Node.js also supports asynchronous and event-driven programming,
    which is essential for handling concurrent requests and building reactive systems.

- en: This book is intended for developers who have some experience with Node.js and
    want to learn how to build microservice applications with it. It assumes that
    you are familiar with the basics of Node.js, such as modules, callbacks, promises,
    and events. It also assumes that you have some knowledge of web development, such
    as HTTP, REST, JSON, and HTML. However, you do not need to be an expert in any
    of these topics, as the book will explain them as needed.
