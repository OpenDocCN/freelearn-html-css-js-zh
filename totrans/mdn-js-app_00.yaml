- en: The book begins by covering an enterprise-level application with the microservices
    architecture, using Node.js to build web services. As we move forward, the book
    shows you how to build a browser-browser application using WebRTC. We then focus
    on building a real-time web application with WebSockets.

- en: When you've gained a solid grip on the different architectures, you'll see how
    to write better reactive code using functional reactive programming (FRP). Then,
    we'll move onto what's new in Bootstrap 4 and how it makes it easier then ever
    to build responsive sites. As we near the end of this book, you'll see how to
    build a modern single-page application that builds on the innovative component-based
    architecture using React and Angular 2.
