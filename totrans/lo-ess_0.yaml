- en: At times, JavaScript can be a frustrating programming language to work with.
    Just when you think you have it entirely figured out, performance or cross-browser
    issues reveal themselves in the worst possible way. Lo-Dash is just one of many
    libraries that aim to help JavaScript programmers write code that's elegant, efficient,
    and portable. Underscore.js introduced a better way to perform functional programming
    with JavaScript. Lo-Dash is a continuation of this effort, and throughout this
    book, we'll see what sets Lo-Dash apart from other libraries out there, including
    Underscore.

- en: At its heart, JavaScript is a functional language, but not necessarily a pure
    functional language—you can modify variables and introduce side effects. However,
    functions are first-class citizens and you can do a lot with them. Lo-Dash embraces
    this idea and gives programmers all the tools they need to write functional code
    that's readable and maintainable. All the cool things you can do with higher-order
    functions in other languages are possible with Lo-Dash as well.

- en: It's not just the low-level utilities and performance gains that Lo-Dash delivers,
    though these are always welcome; it's also the enhanced programming model and
    the ideas that Lo-Dash borrows from other languages such as functional and applicative
    programming. These are imparted to JavaScript applications as a coherent API.
    Underscore got the ball rolling, and Lo-Dash further enhances these ideas, albeit
    using different design and implementation strategies.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Working with Arrays and Collections"), *Working
    with Arrays and Collections*, explains that collections are similar to arrays
    but are more general than arrays. This chapter looks at the differences between
    these two constructs and the available Lo-Dash functions that operate on them.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Working with Objects"), *Working with Objects*,
    teaches you how Lo-Dash treats objects as collections. This chapter looks at the
    available functions that work with objects.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Working with Functions"), *Working with Functions*,
    focuses on the functional tools provided by Lo-Dash.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Transformations Using Map/Reduce"), *Transformations
    Using Map/Reduce*, explains that the map/reduce programming model is used often
    in the Lo-Dash code. This chapter offers many examples that utilize the Lo-Dash
    map/reduce tools in their various forms.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Assembling Chains"), *Assembling Chains*,
    explains how Lo-Dash can chain together functions that operate on a value. This
    chapter explores what chains are and how they work.'

    Building Blocks*, looks at the high-level application components that help organize
    the Lo-Dash code.'

- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Using Lo-Dash with Other Libraries"), *Using
    Lo-Dash with Other Libraries*, explains that Lo-Dash doesn''t do everything. This
    chapter uses examples to illustrate where other libraries can help Lo-Dash and
    vice versa.'

- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Internal Design and Performance"), *Internal
    Design and Performance*, looks at some of the internal design decisions of Lo-Dash
    and provides some advice on how to improve the performance of your Lo-Dash code.'

- en: The only software required for running the examples in this book is a modern
    web browser. All JavaScript libraries are packaged with the code samples. The
    only exception is [Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Using Lo-Dash with Other Libraries"),
    *Using Lo-Dash with Other Libraries*, which involves working with Node.js ([http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/))
    and some corresponding npm packages.

- en: This book is for the intermediate JavaScript programmer who is either new to
    Lo-Dash or has been using it for a while. Whether you've never written a line
    of Lo-Dash or you've got Lo-Dash code running in production, this book has something
    for you. Ideally, you've written some intermediate/advanced JavaScript code and
    utilized libraries such as jQuery or Backbone.
