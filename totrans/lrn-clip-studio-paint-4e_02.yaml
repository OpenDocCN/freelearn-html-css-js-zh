    want to explore the program and ensure that it will meet your needs before buying
    it. At the time of writing, the Clip Studio Paint free trial lasts for up to 3
    months on most devices, and 6 months on Galaxy. You can try both the Clip Studio
    Paint Pro and Clip Studio Paint EX versions of the program. Also, when using the

    There are very few differences between the Pro and EX versions of the software.
    The Pro version is the standard version, and EX is the full-featured version.
    Clip Studio Paint Pro is less expensive than the EX version. The biggest difference
    between the two versions of the program is that the EX version allows you to create
    multi-page files (files with multiple pages in them that can be viewed and edited
    all at once) and that the EX version has no limit regarding the number of animation
    frames in a file, while the Pro version limits animation frames to a total of
    24\. If you will be creating long animations, chapters of a comic or manga, or
    other works where viewing multiple pages is needed, it is highly recommended to
    get the EX version of Clip Studio Paint.

    Let’s break some of those options down so that you can make a good choice when
    purchasing your tablet.

    Traditional tablets are slates that plug into or connect wirelessly to your computer.
    You then use the stylus to draw on the tablet while looking at the separate monitor,
    just like using a mouse on a computer.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A monitor tablet is a tablet with a monitor screen built into it. You then use
    the stylus directly on the screen so that you can see your hand and what you’re
    drawing at the same time. This method feels more like using traditional paper
    and pencil and requires less of an adjustment period for new tablet users, as
    there is less of a disconnect between what your hand does and what your eyes see.
    A traditional tablet is fantastic for painting, but for detailed drawings that
    require accuracy, such as inking, a monitor tablet plays a great role.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, this comes at a price. Monitor tablets are becoming more affordable
    every year, but they are still much more expensive than traditional tablets. If
    you are purchasing a tablet for a young artist or are someone just getting into
    digital art, I always recommend getting a traditional tablet. They are far more
    affordable and usually easy to find second-hand, but still in good working order.
    For more established artists who do a lot of art and know for certain that they
    like working digitally, investing in a larger tablet or a tablet monitor will
    usually speed up your workflow and make life easier, so it makes sense to invest
    in a higher-end tablet.

- en: How large of a tablet should I buy?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tablets come in all sizes, from no bigger than a traditional mouse pad to the
    size of a tabletop. The size of the tablet that you buy is very much dependent
    on how you draw. Sit down and draw on a piece of regular paper, and try to pay
    attention to how large or small you draw. You’ll need to figure that out before
    you can decide on the size of the tablet you want to buy!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another thing to consider when looking at different sizes of tablets is the
    space you have to store them. If you are using a tablet with your laptop and will
    be traveling with it often, or if you have only a small amount of space on your
    desk, you will want to purchase a smaller tablet that is more easily transported.
    However, if you have a larger area or will only be using the tablet at a desk,
    a larger tablet could be the right fit for you. I find that people who draw small
    can be comfortable with a small tablet size. Personally, I draw rather large and
    tend to take up the whole sheet of paper when I draw, so I like a larger tablet
    when I work because it gives me more room to work with.

    going on, but they are an extremely useful part of the Clip Studio Paint software.
    The Quick Access palette gives us access to more frequently used actions, much
    like the command bar. The Quick Access palette can also be customized, but unlike
    the command bar, it has two sets inside of it. This allows more flexibility, as
    Set 1 could be used for functions such as save and undo, while Set 2 could be
    set up with the most widely used tools or other commands to make tasks like coloring
    easier. We’ll explore the Quick Access palette in more depth in *Chapter 5*, *Pages
    and Panels to Shape Manga*. This part of the software also contains the **Material**
    palette, shown right. Materials can be everything from comic frame templates,
    word balloons, and photographs to special brush designs and 3D models. There’s
    a huge variety of items contained in the Material palette. We’ll learn more about
    3D models in *Chapter 14*, *Using 3D Figures and Objects*, and more about the
