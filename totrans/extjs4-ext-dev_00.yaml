- en: In this modern world of JavaScript, Ext JS offers a vast collection of cross-browser
    utilities, a great collection of UI widgets, charts, data object stores, and much
    more. When developing an application, we mostly look for the best support for
    the functionality and components that offer the framework. But we almost always
    face the situation when the framework does not have the specific functionality
    or component that we need. Fortunately, Ext JS has a powerful class system that
    makes it easy to extend an existing functionality or component, or to build new
    functionalities or components.
