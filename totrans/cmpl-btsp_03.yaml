- en: Content components in Bootstrap 4 are reserved for the most commonly used HTML
    elements such as images, tables, typography, and more. In this chapter, I'll teach
    you how to use all the building blocks of HTML that you'll need to build any type
    of website or web application. We'll start with a quick overview of each component
    and then we'll build it into our blog project. Bootstrap 4 comes with a brand
    new CSS reset called Reboot. It builds on top of `Normalize.css` to make your
    site look even better out of the box. Before we jump in, let's review some Reboot
    basics when dealing with content components in Bootstrap 4.

- en: Let's start this chapter by reviewing the basics of Reboot when using content
    components in Bootstrap. One of the main changes for content components in Bootstrap
    4 is the switch from `em` to `rem` units of measure. `rem` is short for **root
    em** and is a little bit different from a regular `em` unit. `em` is a relative
    unit to the font-size of the parent element it is contained within. This can cause
    a compounding issue in your code that can be difficult to deal with when you have
    a highly nested set of selectors. The `rem` unit is not relative to its parent,
    it is relative to the root or HTML element. This makes it much easier to determine
    the actual size of text or other content components that will appear on the screen.

- en: The `box-sizing` property is globally set to `border-box` on every element.
    This is good because it ensures that the declared width of an element doesn't
    exceed its size due to excess margins or padding.

- en: The base `font-size` for Bootstrap 4 is `16px` and it is declared on the `html`
    element. On the `body` element, the `font-size` is set to `1rem` for easy responsive
    type-scaling when using media queries.

- en: There are also global `font-family` and `line-height` values set on the `body`
    tag for consistency through all components. By default, the `background-color`
    is set to `#fff` or white on the `body` selector.

- en: There are no major changes to the styles for headings and paragraphs in Bootstrap
    4\. All heading elements have been reset to have their `top-margin` removed. Headings
    have a `margin-bottom` value of `0.5rem`, while paragraphs have a `margin-bottom`
    value of `1rem`.

    list type has had its `top-margin` removed and has a `bottom-margin` of `1rem`.
    If you are nesting lists inside one another, there is no `bottom-margin` at all.'
