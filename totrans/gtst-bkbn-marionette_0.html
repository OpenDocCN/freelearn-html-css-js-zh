<html><head></head><body><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pref05"/>Preface</h1></div></div></div><p>Backbone Marionette is a composite application library for <code class="literal">Backbone.js</code>, which aims to simplify the construction of large-scale JavaScript applications. It is a collection of common design and implementation patterns found in the applications that we build with Backbone, and includes pieces inspired by composite application, event-driven, and messaging architectures.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Starting with Backbone Marionette">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Starting with Backbone Marionette</em>, is an introduction to what Marionette is and the problems it aims to solve. In this chapter, we also learn about its prerequisites, download sources, and documentation.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Our First Application">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Our First Application</em>, introduces three main concepts of Marionette—the application, controller, and router objects— and details the process of building a small application.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Marionette View Types and Their Use">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Marionette View Types and Their Use</em>, digs deep into the view types that Marionette has and how to use them.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Managing Views">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Managing Views</em>, reviews the view management that goes from firing a view, closing it, and re-opening it. We will also introduce some useful objects, such as the <code class="literal">Renderer</code> object and the <code class="literal">TemplateCache</code> object, that are very valuable in order to build an application.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Divide and Conquer – Modularizing Everything">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Divide and Conquer – Modularizing Everything</em>, talks about how to modularize an application and break it into small subapplications. Being able to do this will increase its productivity as the modules allow the adding of new functionality without affecting the existing code.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Messaging">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Messaging</em>, explains that in order to build a loosely coupled application, the components need to know very little about each other; however, these components still need to work together. In this chapter, we also learn how to archive this through messages and events.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Changing and Growing">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Changing and Growing</em>, helps us to learn how to manage a problem that comes with large-scale applications: the file explosions, and how to keep a clean structure.</p></div></div>
