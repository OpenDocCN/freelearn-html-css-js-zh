- en: JavaScript is an integral part of web development and server-side programming.
    Understanding the fundamentals of JavaScript can not only help a person create
    interactive web applications but also help set up web servers, create mobile applications
    through frameworks such as React Native, and even create desktop applications
    using frameworks such as electronJS.

- en: This book introduces the fresh and core concepts of JavaScript in the form of
    ECMAScript 2017 (ES8), which includes everything you'll need to get started with
    JavaScript and have a basic-to-advanced understanding so that you can implement
    everything mentioned in the first paragraph.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for anybody who is absolutely new to JavaScript and is willing
    to learn this technology. This book can also be used by people who are familiar
    with old JavaScript and want to level up their knowledge to the latest standard
    and use techniques. For more advanced users, this book can be used to brush up
    concepts such as modularity, web workers, and shared memory.

- en: '[Chapter 1](5df1047d-8ef2-4147-8eb4-98dfb4ed2781.xhtml), *Getting Started wit**h
    ECMAScript*, discusses what ECMAScript really is and why we call it ECMAScript
    and not JavaScript. It also discusses how to create variables, perform basic operations,
    and provides new ways to do those operations in ES8.'

    all the functions you need to know as a beginner and intermediate JavaScript developer
    to work smoothly on various kinds of projects. The functions taught in this chapter
    are universal and generic functions, which you''ll be able to understand and apply
    anywhere they''re necessary for your code.'

    how to iterate over iteratable things in JavaScript the proper way. We discuss
    Symbol, a new native JavaScript type, what it is, and why we need it. We also
    discuss the tail call optimization technique, which is implemented by browsers
    to speed up the code.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](d37a4519-f5c0-4f5b-a3b4-df5e0091949e.xhtml), *Asynchronous Programming*, explores
    modern ways to implement asynchronous programming and compares it with the not-so-beautiful
    past approaches, which included callback hell. It''ll teach you about implementing
    asynchronous programming in a synchronous way.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](c386c5c8-d74c-4096-916b-262ceb2b9cc7.xhtml), *Modular Programming*,
    discusses modularizing your JavaScript code into different files so that it is
    easy to reuse and debug individual modules. We start with primitive and third-party
    solutions available earlier and then cover the native support browsers are bringing
    to the world.'

    Reflect API*, demonstrates information about the Reflect API provided in JavaScript,
    which basically helps to manipulate the properties and methods of the objects.'

- en: '[Chapter 7](e4168fc4-4576-45fa-8bc6-2b3bfa783804.xhtml), *Proxies*, introduces
    a new implementation in JavaScript, that is, proxies over objects. It has a number
    of advantages, such as hiding private properties, setting default values for object
    properties and methods, and making awesome custom features. Such as Python-like
    array slicing for JavaScript.'

- en: '[Chapter 8](d13ca961-e08f-46d5-9801-c00c07b23075.xhtml), *Classes*, explores
    classes, how they''re implemented, inheritance in classes, and how finally classes
    is just a syntatic sugar over the function implementation only. This is important
    because classes make the code more readable and understandable to people coming
    from an OOP background.'

    by browser on the web to the developers, and how JavaScript can be used to interact

    workers using shared memory to allow blazingly fast access to memory by the web
    workers through `SharedArrayBuffer`. It covers some of the common problems related
    to threads sharing the same data, and also provides solutions to those problems.'
