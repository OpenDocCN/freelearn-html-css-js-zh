			<p>In previous chapters, you have learned how to use <strong class="bold">Announcement</strong> posts in <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>, <strong class="bold">Material</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Question</strong> posts in <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong>. In this chapter, you will learn about the next post type found in Classwork: the <strong class="bold">Assignment</strong> post. This post allows you to assign documents stored in Google Drive, then have students edit files and then turn them in for grading.</p>
			<p>This chapter will focus on assigning and taking in assignments because the grading process is similar to grading a <strong class="bold">Question</strong> post. However, there are some additional features available when grading assignments rather than questions, which the next chapter will explore. Furthermore, these question types heavily incorporate Google Docs and Google Drive, which are additional apps in Google's Workspace for Education.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will explore the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Creating an Assignment post</li>
				<li>Sharing files in assignments</li>
				<li>Viewing student files</li>
				<li>Turning in assignments</li>
				<li>File ownership for assignments</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-68"><a id="_idTextAnchor067"/>Creating an Assignment post</h1>
			<p>Similar to <a id="_idIndexMarker201"/>the <strong class="bold">Question</strong> post, much of the <strong class="bold">Assignment</strong> post's features are found in all three previous post types.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">If you are not reading the chapters in order, consider reading <a href="B16846_01_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Getting to Know Google Classroom</em>; <a href="B16846_03_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor040"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Sending Your First Announcement</em>; and <a href="B16846_04_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor055"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Starting an Online Discussion with Questions</em>.</p>
			<p>To create an <strong class="bold">Assignment</strong> post, execute the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> section, click on the <strong class="bold">+ Create</strong> icon and then click on <strong class="bold">Assignment</strong>:<div><img src="img/Figure_5.1_B16846.jpg" alt="" width="277" height="159"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.1 – The Assignment option in Classwork</p></li>
				<li>Fill in <a id="_idIndexMarker202"/>the <strong class="bold">Title</strong> and <strong class="bold">Instructions</strong> fields:<div><img src="img/Figure_5.2_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.2 – The Title and Instructions fields of the Assignment post&#13;&#10;" width="741" height="401"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.2 – The Title and Instructions fields of the Assignment post</p></li>
				<li>In the right column, select the classes, students within the classes, points the assignment is worth, due date, and topic for the assignment:<div><img src="img/Figure_5.3_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.3 – Class, students, points, due date, and topic options of the Assignment post&#13;&#10;" width="589" height="722"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.3 – Class, students, points, due date, and topic options of the Assignment post</p></li>
				<li>Use the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> menu <a id="_idIndexMarker203"/>icon to add files to the assignment (this step is covered extensively in <a href="B16846_03_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor040"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Sending Your First Announcement</em>):<div><img src="img/Figure_5.4_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.4 – Add files from Google Drive or your computer&#13;&#10;" width="439" height="346"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.4 – Add files from Google Drive or your computer</p></li>
				<li>If necessary, add additional links to websites and YouTube videos during this step.</li>
				<li>Click the <strong class="bold">Assign</strong> button to post the assignment:<div><img src="img/Figure_5.5_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.5 – Completed Assignment post ready to assign&#13;&#10;" width="1064" height="582"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.5 – Completed Assignment post ready to assign</p></li>
				<li>While not <a id="_idIndexMarker204"/>necessary, attaching files to an <strong class="bold">Assignment</strong> post separates its features from the <strong class="bold">Question</strong> post. Where the <strong class="bold">Question</strong> post allows the grading of student responses to the post, the <strong class="bold">Assignment</strong> post allows the grading of the files attached to the assignment. In the following screenshot, you will see that the <strong class="bold">Assignment</strong> post, like the <strong class="bold">Question</strong> post, also tracks how many students have turned in the assignment when viewed in the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> section:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.6_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.6 – View how many students have turned in the assignment&#13;&#10;" width="916" height="381"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.6 – View how many students have turned in the assignment</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Assignment</strong> post also includes settings for a rubric and to check for plagiarism. These two settings are explored in <a href="B16846_06_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor079"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Grading Written Assignments in a Flash</em>.</p>
			<p>When teaching in person, there are documents that you may present on a project, documents <a id="_idIndexMarker205"/>that every student may be able to mark up, and documents that are photocopied for each student. When attaching files to <strong class="bold">Assignment</strong> posts, there are additional settings for Google Docs that resemble each use case.</p>
			<p>The next section outlines how to set student permissions to only view the file, edit the file, or have an individual copy made for each student.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-69"><a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>Sharing files in assignments</h1>
			<p>If you <a id="_idIndexMarker206"/>attach a file from your computer or Google Drive, you <a id="_idIndexMarker207"/>will notice an additional option beside the file that is not present in other post types. This new option, displayed in the following screenshot, allows you to choose how students receive this file:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.7_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.7 – Assignment-specific Google Docs share settings&#13;&#10;" width="876" height="266"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.7 – Assignment-specific Google Docs share settings</p>
			<p>Each sharing <a id="_idIndexMarker208"/>option allows a different level of student <a id="_idIndexMarker209"/>interaction:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Students can view file</strong> does not let students interact with this file. They are only able to read, download, or print the file.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Students can edit file</strong> allows all students to edit the same file. Therefore, you and your students will see each other's changes in real time.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Make a copy for each student</strong> will create a copy of the file in your Google Drive for each student. Students will not see what other students write in the document.<p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">You can further prevent students from downloading or printing the file. However, those are advanced settings found in Google Drive and are beyond the scope of this book.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Choosing when to use which sharing permission depends on the purpose of the file. For example, if students are practicing editing a document, an assignment could be similar to the one shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.8_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.8 – An example of an assignment where students edit the file&#13;&#10;" width="659" height="351"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.8 – An example of an assignment where students edit the file</p>
			<p>Another example <a id="_idIndexMarker210"/>is if you want students to critically respond <a id="_idIndexMarker211"/>to work. You can attach some files with the <strong class="bold">Students can view file</strong> <strong class="bold">option </strong>and then attach the document that you want them to complete with the <strong class="bold">Make a copy for each student option</strong>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.9_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.9 – An example of an assignment where students have individual files&#13;&#10;" width="614" height="435"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.9 – An example of an assignment where students have individual files</p>
			<p>To utilize the full features of the <strong class="bold">Assignment</strong> post, ensure that the files you assign the <strong class="bold">Make a copy for each student</strong> option are documents created in Google Docs or converted into the Google Docs format. Students will only be able to edit the Google Docs file <a id="_idIndexMarker212"/>formats for Docs, Sheets, and Slides.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">It is important to decide file permissions before you post the assignment. If a file's permission is set to view or edit, it cannot be changed to make a copy for each student afterward.</p>
			<p>Now that <a id="_idIndexMarker213"/>you have published the <strong class="bold">Assignment</strong> post, students will be able to turn in their work. In the next section, you will then be able to easily see their responses to the assignment.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-70"><a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>Viewing student files</h1>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Assignment</strong> post has <a id="_idIndexMarker214"/>greater complexity than the other posts because there are files associated with the assignment. There are two different locations to access files turned in by students – Google Classroom and Google Drive.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-71"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>Viewing student files in Google Classroom</h2>
			<p>To access <a id="_idIndexMarker215"/>student files in Google Classroom, regardless <a id="_idIndexMarker216"/>of whether they have turned in their work or not, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> section, click on the title of the post and then click on <strong class="bold">View assignment</strong>:<div><img src="img/Figure_5.10_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.10 – Opening the assignment in the Classwork tab&#13;&#10;" width="777" height="286"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.10 – Opening the assignment in the Classwork tab</p></li>
				<li>You will now be on the <strong class="bold">Student work</strong> page. This page only shows thumbnails of the <a id="_idIndexMarker217"/>first attachment for each <a id="_idIndexMarker218"/>student. To view all files a student turns in, click on the name of the student in the left column:<div><img src="img/Figure_5.11_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.11 – Selecting a student to view attachments &#13;&#10;" width="965" height="487"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.11 – Selecting a student to view attachments </p><p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">If you have been using Google Classroom before the 2018 major updates or coming from the previous version of this book, clicking on the title of the <strong class="bold">Assignment</strong> post notification in the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong> will also take you to the <strong class="bold">Student Work</strong> page.</p></li>
				<li>Click on the file you want to view:<div><img src="img/Figure_5.12_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.12 – Selecting a student's assignment attachment&#13;&#10;" width="944" height="214"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.12 – Selecting a student's assignment attachment</p></li>
				<li>A new tab <a id="_idIndexMarker219"/>will open with the <strong class="bold">Grading Tool</strong>. This page allows you to switch between students, view student files, grade <a id="_idIndexMarker220"/>the assignment, and leave comments. The following screenshot highlights the navigation tools within the page:<div><img src="img/Figure_5.13_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.13 – Navigation on the Grading Tool page&#13;&#10;" width="1032" height="441"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.13 – Navigation on the Grading Tool page</p></li>
				<li>When you attach a file using the <strong class="bold">Make a copy for each student</strong> setting, the copies of the file will not be created until the student accesses the assignment. Therefore, you may have some students that do not have an assignment file created when you view the <strong class="bold">Student Work</strong> page:<div><img src="img/Figure_5.14_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.14 – Aiden has not opened the assignment yet&#13;&#10;" width="870" height="454"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.14 – Aiden has not opened the assignment yet</p></li>
				<li>If the files are available, another method of viewing files from students is to click on the <a id="_idIndexMarker221"/>file thumbnail in the main <a id="_idIndexMarker222"/>section of the <strong class="bold">Student Work</strong> page as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.15_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.15 – Student assignment files thumbnail&#13;&#10;" width="409" height="374"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.15 – Student assignment files thumbnail</p>
			<p>The Google Classroom mobile app is another method to view student files.</p>
			<h3>Viewing student files on the Google Classroom mobile app</h3>
			<p>If you have a smartphone or tablet, viewing student files on your mobile device is a great way <a id="_idIndexMarker223"/>to multitask during class time. I have opened student files on my mobile device while managing the class <a id="_idIndexMarker224"/>countless times. Changes are visible in real time so that you can see the changes that the students are making without having to look over shoulders. The following steps will use the Google Classroom app on a Google Android device. Using the app on an Apple iOS device will use similar steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">On the Home Screen, tap the <strong class="bold">Classroom</strong> app:<div><img src="img/Figure_5.16_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.16 – Google Classroom app&#13;&#10;" width="550" height="215"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.16 – Google Classroom app</p></li>
				<li>Tap on the class:<div><img src="img/Figure_5.17_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.17 – The class in the Google Classroom app&#13;&#10;" width="550" height="510"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.17 – The class in the Google Classroom app</p></li>
				<li>Tap <a id="_idIndexMarker225"/>on the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> icon <a id="_idIndexMarker226"/>at the bottom of the app:<div><img src="img/Figure_5.18_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.18 – The Classwork icon in the Google Classroom app&#13;&#10;" width="573" height="925"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.18 – The Classwork icon in the Google Classroom app</p></li>
				<li>Tap <a id="_idIndexMarker227"/>on the title of the <a id="_idIndexMarker228"/>assignment post:<div><img src="img/Figure_5.19_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.19 – The Assignment post in the Classwork tab&#13;&#10;" width="557" height="348"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.19 – The Assignment post in the Classwork tab</p></li>
				<li>Tap <a id="_idIndexMarker229"/>on the student's <a id="_idIndexMarker230"/>name:<div><img src="img/Figure_5.20_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.20 – Selecting the student in Student work&#13;&#10;" width="551" height="521"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.20 – Selecting the student in Student work</p></li>
				<li>Tap on the file to view it:<div><img src="img/Figure_5.21_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.21 – Tap file for turned-in student work&#13;&#10;" width="533" height="455"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.21 – Tap file for turned-in student work</p></li>
				<li>The file will open in Google Docs:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.22_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.22 – Preview of student's turned-in file&#13;&#10;" width="550" height="311"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.22 – Preview of student's turned-in file</p>
			<p>In Apple's iOS, the first time you open a file from Google Classroom, dialog boxes will appear <a id="_idIndexMarker231"/>after <em class="italic">step 5</em> asking for <a id="_idIndexMarker232"/>permission to access the Google Drive and Google Docs apps on the iPad or iPhone.</p>
			<p>On Apple's iOS and Google's Android, the Google Drive and Google Docs apps must be present on the device. If they are not already installed, refer to <a href="B16846_02_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor026"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Inviting Students to Their Virtual Classroom</em>, for comprehensive instructions.</p>
			<p>If the <strong class="bold">Assignment</strong> post was assigned recently, clicking on the notification in the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong> will save a few taps from the previous steps. Just like on the website, the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong> is the <a id="_idIndexMarker233"/>first section visible in the app. An image of the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong> on mobile is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.23_B16846.jpg" alt="Fug 5.23 – The Assignment post notification in the Stream&#13;&#10;" width="498" height="622"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Fug 5.23 – The Assignment post notification in the Stream</p>
			<p>If you <a id="_idIndexMarker234"/>have an Apple iPad with Apple Pencil or a pen-enabled Android tablet, this mobile view will also be beneficial for leaving teacher feedback, which is covered in the succeeding chapter.</p>
			<p>Files can also be viewed within the Google Drive app, which the next section explores.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-72"><a id="_idTextAnchor071"/>Viewing student files in Google Drive</h2>
			<p>Google Drive <a id="_idIndexMarker235"/>is an online file storage and management <a id="_idIndexMarker236"/>app for Google Apps. All files uploaded or created in Google Classroom are stored in Google Drive. Since it is possible to view student files directly from the Google Drive app, it can be more convenient to access student files there if you already use Google Drive frequently. Oftentimes, if I am viewing images or other non-Google files, I will use Google Drive.</p>
			<p>There is no limit to how much data you can store in Google Drive for Google Apps for Education and Google Apps for Work accounts; however, standard Google accounts (emails that end in <code>@gmail.com</code>) have a 15 GB total storage limit. For standard Google accounts, Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides files do not contribute to the 15 GB maximum.</p>
			<p>Use the <a id="_idIndexMarker237"/>following steps to view student files from <a id="_idIndexMarker238"/>the Google Drive app:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In <strong class="bold">Google Chrome</strong>, navigate to <a href="https://drive.google.com">https://drive.google.com</a>. An alternative is to click on the app launcher in another Google app (such as Gmail or Google Calendar) and then click on the <strong class="bold">Drive</strong> icon:<div><img src="img/Figure_5.24_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.24 – The Drive icon in the App Launcher&#13;&#10;" width="321" height="263"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.24 – The Drive icon in the App Launcher</p></li>
				<li>Click on the folder named <strong class="bold">Classroom</strong>:<div><img src="img/Figure_5.25_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.25 – Classroom folder in Google Drive&#13;&#10;" width="733" height="241"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.25 – Classroom folder in Google Drive</p></li>
				<li>Click <a id="_idIndexMarker239"/>on the folder with the class name:<div><img src="img/Figure_5.26_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.26 – Class folder&#13;&#10;" width="458" height="105"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.26 – Class folder</p></li>
				<li>Click <a id="_idIndexMarker240"/>on the folder with the same title <a id="_idIndexMarker241"/>as the assignment post:<div><img src="img/Figure_5.27_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.27 – Assignment post folder&#13;&#10;" width="543" height="171"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.27 – Assignment post folder</p></li>
				<li>Click on the assignment you wish to view:<div><img src="img/Figure_5.28_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.28 – Thumbnail preview of student file&#13;&#10;" width="673" height="338"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.28 – Thumbnail preview of student file</p></li>
				<li>The <a id="_idIndexMarker242"/>file will open in a new tab in Google <a id="_idIndexMarker243"/>Docs:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.29_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.29 – Student file open in Google Docs&#13;&#10;" width="1189" height="407"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.29 – Student file open in Google Docs</p>
			<p>As Google Drive defaults to a thumbnail view of files, you can view files in a details list. In the following screenshot, you can see that the filename is cut off, obscuring the student name. Click on the <strong class="bold">List View</strong> icon in the menu:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.30_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.30 – The List View icon&#13;&#10;" width="939" height="423"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.30 – The List View icon</p>
			<p>Your files will no longer show a thumbnail of the first page. Instead, only the file format <a id="_idIndexMarker244"/>icon and the filename will be visible. Additionally, two columns containing more details about the document <a id="_idIndexMarker245"/>will appear. The following screenshot shows the <strong class="bold">List View</strong> of Google Drive:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.31_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.31 – Student files in List View&#13;&#10;" width="395" height="237"/>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.31 – Student files in List View</p>
			<h3>Downloading student files from Google Drive</h3>
			<p>Depending on your use case, it may be more efficient to download all the files within an assignment folder and use a program on your computer to view the files. An example of this use <a id="_idIndexMarker246"/>case is if students are primarily attaching image files. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many math and art teachers <a id="_idIndexMarker247"/>at my school instructed students to attach photos of their math question solutions and artwork.</p>
			<p>Teachers would then download the files and open the images in the computer image viewer, where they could more efficiently switch between images.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Give clear instructions for filenames</p>
			<p class="callout">If you plan on downloading files using this method, be sure to give your students clear instructions on how the files must be named. Since my school's grading software orders alphabetically by last name, I instruct my students to name files as <em class="italic">last name, first name – assignment name</em> whenever I plan on downloading their assignment files.</p>
			<p>To download a ZIP file of the <strong class="bold">Google Classroom</strong> folder, navigate to the folder in Google Drive, then click on the menu in the folder path and select <strong class="bold">Download</strong>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.32_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.32 – Download a folder from Google Drive&#13;&#10;" width="806" height="439"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.32 – Download a folder from Google Drive</p>
			<p>Windows and macOS both have built-in software to extract the folder of student files from the ZIP file. While double-clicking the ZIP file in macOS will automatically extract the ZIP file contents into a folder, in Windows, it will open the ZIP file in Windows Explorer. To extract the files from the ZIP file in Windows, click on the <strong class="bold">Extract all</strong> button <a id="_idIndexMarker248"/>in the <a id="_idIndexMarker249"/>ribbon, shown here:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.33_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.33 – Extract all button in File Explorer for ZIP files&#13;&#10;" width="1108" height="461"/>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-73"><a id="_idTextAnchor072"/>Turning in assignments</h1>
			<p>If students are new to using Google Classroom, they may also need guidance for turning in their assignments through Google Classroom. During my time teaching, I learned that if I did not <a id="_idIndexMarker250"/>explicitly show students how to turn in assignments, I would receive them incomplete or through email. To save extra work in collecting assignments, take a few moments at the beginning of the first few assignments to show students how to properly turn in assignments. After assigning the assignment, have a student log into a computer connected to a projector so that you can show the students the steps to correctly submit the assignment.</p>
			<p>For assignments with Google Docs, sharing files with the <strong class="bold">Make a copy for each student</strong> setting is the simplest method for students to turn in an assignment. With the Bean Sprout Lab example, the assignment contains one Google Doc that the student needs to edit. Since it was shared with the <strong class="bold">Make a copy for each student</strong> setting, when the student opens the Google document, a <strong class="bold">TURN IN</strong> button will appear in the menu as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.34_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.34 – TURN IN button in a Google document&#13;&#10;" width="919" height="112"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.34 – TURN IN button in a Google document</p>
			<p>When the student finishes the assignment, they can click the <strong class="bold">TURN IN</strong> button in the Google document and they will confirm the submission in the dialog box that appears:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.35_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.35 – Confirmation dialog box in Google Classroom&#13;&#10;" width="607" height="283"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.35 – Confirmation dialog box in Google Classroom</p>
			<p>For the first few assignments, use this method exclusively. It is the easiest method for students to <a id="_idIndexMarker251"/>turn in assignments because there are fewer steps for the student. Once students are comfortable turning in Google Docs assignments with the <strong class="bold">Make a copy for each student</strong> setting, then I provide more complex assignments where students can add additional files to the assignment.</p>
			<p>When a student turns in an assignment, the icon beside the assignment in the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> section changes from colored to gray. Therefore, a student can easily see which assignments in the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> section still require submission:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.36 – Icon color change beside an Assignment/Question post in the Classwork section</p>
			<p>The icons beside <strong class="bold">Assignment</strong> post notifications within the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong> do not change.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-74"><a id="_idTextAnchor073"/>Adding additional files to assignments</h2>
			<p>As students become more proficient in turning in assignments in Google Classroom, they will <a id="_idIndexMarker252"/>be able to complete more complex assignments. Students can create additional Google Docs files for their assignments before turning them in. To do that, guide them through these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> section, have students click on the title of the assignment, then click on <strong class="bold">View assignment</strong>:<div><img src="img/Figure_5.37_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.37 – Open the Assignment post&#13;&#10;" width="968" height="410"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.37 – Open the Assignment post</p></li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add or Create</strong> drop-down menu. Then, click on the <strong class="bold">Docs</strong> icon or text:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.38_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.38 – Create a Google document in an Assignment&#13;&#10;" width="1046" height="467"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.38 – Create a Google document in an Assignment</p>
			<p>A blank Google document will open in a new tab. Because it is created inside an <strong class="bold">Assignment</strong> post, it will also have the <strong class="bold">Turn in</strong> button in its toolbar.</p>
			<p>Despite Google Docs often referencing the document editor app, it can also reference the entire <a id="_idIndexMarker253"/>office suite of apps including Google Slides and Google Sheets.</p>
			<p>Students are also able to attach files directly from Google Drive or their computer. In the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> menu, they can choose <strong class="bold">Google Drive</strong> or <strong class="bold">File to add additional files</strong>.</p>
			<h3>Using mobile devices with assignments</h3>
			<p>If students <a id="_idIndexMarker254"/>use the Google Classroom app, they will be able to use additional features found within the Google Classroom mobile app. Students are able to take photos and videos directly from the app and attach them to the assignment:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">On the mobile app, students can tap the <strong class="bold">Assignment</strong> post title in the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> or <strong class="bold">Stream</strong> sections:<div><img src="img/Figure_5.39_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.39 – Assignment post in the Classroom mobile app&#13;&#10;" width="628" height="644"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.39 – Assignment post in the Classroom mobile app</p></li>
				<li>Tap or <a id="_idIndexMarker255"/>swipe up from the <strong class="bold">Your work</strong> section:<div><img src="img/Figure_5.40_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.40 – The Your work section of the Assignment post in the Classroom app&#13;&#10;" width="585" height="852"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.40 – The Your work section of the Assignment post in the Classroom app</p></li>
				<li>Tap on the <strong class="bold">Add attachment</strong> button:<div><img src="img/Figure_5.41_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.41 – The Add attachment button&#13;&#10;" width="571" height="468"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.41 – The Add attachment button</p></li>
				<li>Tap <a id="_idIndexMarker256"/>the <strong class="bold">Take photo</strong> or <strong class="bold">Record video</strong> options as needed:<div><img src="img/Figure_5.42_B16846.jpg" alt="Fig. 5.42 – App specific photo and video attachment options&#13;&#10;" width="491" height="443"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Fig. 5.42 – App specific photo and video attachment options</p></li>
				<li>Using this camera feature, students can take pictures or videos and attach them to the assignment:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.43_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.43 – Image and video files attached to an Assignment post&#13;&#10;" width="497" height="439"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.43 – Image and video files attached to an Assignment post</p>
			<p>Using mobile devices with Google Classroom fosters creative learning and assessment. If there are <a id="_idIndexMarker257"/>enough mobile devices in the class, students can submit skits, songs, oral analysis, laboratory demonstrations, graphs, and more by simply taking pictures or recording video directly from their smartphone or tablet. If there are not enough mobile devices, consider incorporating these assignments in group work. Students may forget to attach a file or want to update a file after turning in the assignment.</p>
			<p>The next section explores how a student can make those changes.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-75"><a id="_idTextAnchor074"/>Unsubmitting and resubmitting assignments</h2>
			<p>At any time after they have submitted their assignment, students are able to make changes <a id="_idIndexMarker258"/>to their assignment. First, the student needs to unsubmit <a id="_idIndexMarker259"/>the assignment, which they can do by clicking on the title of the <strong class="bold">Assignment</strong> post in the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>. Below their work will be an <strong class="bold">Unsubmit</strong> button as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.44_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.44 – The Unsubmit button in the Assignment post&#13;&#10;" width="946" height="281"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.44 – The Unsubmit button in the Assignment post</p>
			<p>Once the assignment is unsubmitted, students will be able to make changes to their files before turning them in again. If students unsubmit and turn in their assignment after the due date, Google Classroom still flags the assignment as late. At the time of writing, there is no way to disable the <strong class="bold">Unsubmit</strong> button.</p>
			<p>Once a student <a id="_idIndexMarker260"/>has unsubmitted an assignment, you will be <a id="_idIndexMarker261"/>able to see when students turn in new submissions. In the <strong class="bold">Student Work</strong> tab of the assignment, clicking <strong class="bold">See history</strong>, shown in the following screenshot, will display a list of when the student turned in the assignment:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.45_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.45 – The See history link&#13;&#10;" width="549" height="242"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.45 – The See history link</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-76"><a id="_idTextAnchor075"/>Turning in assignments late</h2>
			<p>Students are <a id="_idIndexMarker262"/>able to turn in assignments late. However, if they do, Google Classroom will flag the assignment as late:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.46_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.46 – Assignment post Turned in late indicator&#13;&#10;" width="855" height="180"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.46 – Assignment post Turned in late indicator</p>
			<p>At the time of writing, there is no simple method for creating a hard deadline where students <a id="_idIndexMarker263"/>are unable to submit assignments after the deadline.</p>
			<p>In <a href="B16846_08_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor110"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Keeping Parents in the Loop</em>, you will learn how to set up Google Classroom to email parents regularly with upcoming and missing assignments.</p>
			<p>With students' assignments turned in, the next section explores how the permissions of the assignment files change when the assignment is turned in.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-77"><a id="_idTextAnchor076"/>File ownership for assignments</h1>
			<p>Just like with physical assignments, ownership of the student's assignment transfers to the teacher <a id="_idIndexMarker264"/>when students turn in assignments. Therefore, if you <a id="_idIndexMarker265"/>view a student's file in Google Drive, turned in assignments will display <strong class="bold">me</strong> for the owner instead of the student's name:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.47_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 5.47 – Owner column in the Google Drive folder&#13;&#10;" width="889" height="339"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.47 – Owner column in the Google Drive folder</p>
			<p>While seemingly inconsequential, students have limited privileges with turned-in files. For example, they will not see any changes or comments to the assignment until it is returned to them.</p>
			<p>If students unsubmit their assignment after you have graded it but before you have returned it, the student will be able to see your changes or comments but will not see the grade. Grades are only visible to the student when the assignment is returned.</p>
			<p>Another limitation <a id="_idIndexMarker266"/>for students is that they are only able to <a id="_idIndexMarker267"/>view the turned-in files and cannot make any changes unless they unsubmit the assignment. Thus, having ownership transfer to you until you grade and return the assignment ensures that there are no unexpected surprises during the grading process.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-78"><a id="_idTextAnchor077"/>Summary</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Assignment</strong> posts allow you to manage and consolidate your assignments in a single location. You neither have to keep track of which students have turned in their assignments or which ones have not; nor do you need to worry about misplacing assignments at home, in the classroom, or somewhere in between. In addition, you are no longer limited to text. Now you are able to attach any type of file, such as images and videos or links to websites or YouTube videos.</p>
			<p>You are now able to create Assignment posts and know the ins and outs of adding content to the posts, how students turn in assignments, and where you can find all the assignments in Google Classroom and Google Drive. You have learned how to recognize when students unsubmit their assignments or turn them in late.</p>
			<p>In the next two chapters, we will go through various methods of grading assignments in Google Classroom. We will focus on providing meaningful feedback and tools to speed up the grading process.</p>
