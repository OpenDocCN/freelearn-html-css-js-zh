<p class="mce-root">Elm is a wonderful functional programming language for frontend web development. There are a number of reasons why learning Elm will be a useful and enjoyable experience.</p>

<p>Elm is easy to get started with. The learning curve is not too steep. Elm does not introduce an overwhelming amount of new concepts to understand and learn; actually, it is quite the opposite. Once you learn the Elm way of doing things, with the focus on some key concepts of functional programming, there is not a huge number of new topics to understand.</p>
<p>It can be a great way into the more advanced concepts of functional programming. It's probably among the easier ways to start thinking in terms of the functional programming paradigm.</p>
<p>Even though is it easy to learn, the return on investment is pretty high; imagine all the time you will save not having to do JavaScript-style debugging! In the long run, this ROI compounds. The way that Elm achieves this is by having no runtime errors. All the errors are caught at compile time (so you can forget about things like <em>undefined is not a function</em> on a live project). Compile time is very fast. Also, Elm has one of the friendliest and most helpful compilers around.</p>
<p>If you are a bit tired of JavaScript and want to look at alternatives, you will most likely love Elm. Along the same lines, if<span> you have had trouble trying to make up your mind about whether you should learn Angular, or React, or Vue, or any other JS framework, Elm is a viable alternative.</span></p>
<p>If you are learning React, understanding the Elm architecture will help you wrap your mind around Redux. An interesting bit of trivia: Redux was inspired by the Elm architecture.</p>
<p>If you already have some experience with JavaScript, it will give you a new perspective on it, and actually make you a better JavaScript developer. You can even use Elm and JavaScript together! Elm interops with JavaScript so you can use both languages side by side in your projects.</p>
<p>Elm is declarative. Scaling your Elm apps is actually a pleasant experience. Elm has a great community and excellent documentation.</p>

<p>This book was written with the goal of introducing a complete beginner to the Elm language with some of its basic concepts and taking those concepts and building simple web apps in Elm from the get-go.</p>
<p>This book does not cover all the features of the Elm language, but rather gives you a solid foundation that you can build from.</p>
<p>One of the goals of this book was to make it easy for those who read it understand more advanced Elm apps and topics. Another goal of this book was to give you enough knowledge that you can confidently build your own apps in Elm once you complete it.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>This book is intended for web developers of all levels of expertise to use to understand the Elm language and build simple and practical web applications in it.</p>
<p>The beauty of the Elm language, among other things, is in the fact that you don't need to worry too much about HTML and CSS when you write it. So in this book, the focus is mostly on the Elm language itself. </p>
<p>Familiarity with HTML, CSS, and the DOM, as well as how the web works, would be helpful, but is not necessary. Also, some experience with the Bootstrap framework and Material Design Language is welcome, but not compulsory.</p>
<p>This book was written with the goal of finding a sweet spot between giving enough knowledge so that readers can be productive as soon as possible, and being overwhelming. </p>
<p>The book was also written with the idea that someone who is brand new to web development should find it easy to understand. Therefore, the book doesn't assume knowledge of JavaScript, nor does it extensively compare JavaScript with Elm, or if it does, it tries to limit this comparison to the level of broad generalizations.</p>
<p>In a sentence, this book is aimed at beginners and experienced developers alike, regardless of their level of knowledge of JavaScript.</p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>At this time, you might start to appreciate the work that </span><kbd>elm-format</kbd><span> does for us.</span>"</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>main : HTML Never<br/>main =<br/>    view</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>[3,6,9] : List Int</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Upon compilation, the Ellie app will show the words <span class="packt_screen">User Experience</span> in the right-hand preview pane.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
