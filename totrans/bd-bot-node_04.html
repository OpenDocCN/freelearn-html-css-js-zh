https://slack.com/
</a>), the famous real-time messaging app and collaboration suite for teams.</p><p>Slack has been built from the ground up to be easy and fun to use. It offers a broad set of APIs that allows developers to extend its capabilities to make it even more useful.</p><p>One of the features I most enjoy from Slack is the Slackbot. It is a friendly bot available in every Slack team to guide users to create their profiles and to explain to them how Slack works.</p><p>If you think Slackbot sounds cool, what you'll really love even more is the possibility to build your own custom bots, which can act as automated users that can respond to specific events and help your team do useful things.</p><p>Throughout this chapter, we'll explore how we can use the Slack Real Time Messaging API in order to create our own custom Slackbot. We'll walk through the whole process so you can get a really good idea of what is possible.</p><p>By the end of this chapter, you should feel right at home with creating your own Slackbot and know a bit more about Slack and how it could help your team and you.</p><p>Overall, the process should be a lot of fun and easy to follow, so let's not wait any longer and get started!</p><div class="section" title="Getting started"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec24"/>Getting started</h1></div></div></div><p>We are going to be building a bot that gives quotes as responses to the general channel. The idea is to have a bot that inspires your team during their daily activities, and quotes are definitely a great way to get inspired.</p><p>The first thing we need to do is to set up our bot with Slack and register it in order to use the Slack API.</p><p>In order to do this, we'll be using the Slack Real Time Messaging API (<a class="ulink" href="https://api.slack.com/rtm">
https://api.slack.com/rtm
</a>), which is a WebSocket-based API that allows us to receive events in real time and send messages to channels, private groups, and users.</p><p>The API is really well constructed and the documentation is easy to follow. We won't be using WebSockets directly, but instead a Node.js module (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/slackbots">
https://www.npmjs.com/package/slackbots
</a>) that makes development much easier, using JavaScript.</p><p>We need to configure our channel extensions and create the new bot. This way we will obtain the API token that is required to authenticate to Slack and get started. So, let's roll up our sleeves and get moving!</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Registering a bot on Slack" id="aid-VF2I1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec25"/>Registering a bot on Slack</h1></div></div></div><p>In order to add the bot into your Slack organization, we'll need to register it at the following URL: <a class="ulink" href="https://yourorganization.slack.com/services/new/bot">
https://yourorganization.slack.com/services/new/bot
</a>.</p><p>Notice that you will need to change your organization with the name of your company or team, which you used when registering your Slack account. Once you open up the URL in your browser, you will be redirected to the following screen:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00231.jpeg" alt="Registering a bot on Slack"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>We'll be calling our bot, <code class="literal">quotebot</code>. This is the value we will fill in our username. Notice how Slack requires that all bot names are all written in lowercase.</p><p>Once the name has been entered in the <span class="strong"><strong>Username</strong></span> field, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Add bot integration</strong></span> button.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00232.jpeg" alt="Registering a bot on Slack"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>Once that has been done, you will be presented with a screen where the bot can be further customized and features can be added, such as a picture or emoji. This is what this screen looks like:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00233.jpeg" alt="Registering a bot on Slack"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>There are further options that are available and can be customized, but they don't fit in a single screenshot, so you'll see them once you reach the end of this screen. Nothing too complicated.</p><p>This screen also contains the <span class="strong"><strong>API Token</strong></span>, which we will need to reference in our code.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00234.jpeg" alt="Registering a bot on Slack"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>Once you've done the necessary configuration adjustments and changes, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Save Integration</strong></span> button.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00235.jpeg" alt="Registering a bot on Slack"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Setting up our Node.js app" id="aid-10DJ41"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec26"/>Setting up our Node.js app</h1></div></div></div><p>Now that we've registered our bot on Slack we are ready to set up our Node.js project in order to start coding.</p><p>Let's go ahead and create our <code class="literal">package.json</code> file. Open the Command Prompt and type the following command:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>npm init</strong></span>
</pre><p>After you have done this, follow the guided configuration procedure, which should look similar to the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00236.jpeg" alt="Setting up our Node.js app"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>Once you have finished with this configuration, it is time to install the dependencies we will need in order to write our bot.</p><p>But before we install any dependencies, let's quickly brainstorm what our bot should do. In short, our bot must be able to retrieve a quote and reply back to the general channel.</p><p>There's an awesome site called <span class="emphasis"><em>They Said So</em></span> (<a class="ulink" href="https://theysaidso.com/">
https://theysaidso.com/
</a>), which is a service that provides <span class="strong"><strong>Quotes-as-a-Service</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>QAAS</strong></span>). Quotes from multiple authors can be obtained through an easy-to-use REST API.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00237.jpeg" alt="Setting up our Node.js app"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>As we'll need to access this service using REST, let's include a REST client library for Node.js in our app. Just like we did in the previous chapter, we'll be using this one.</p><p>In order to get this library installed, execute this instruction from the command line:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>npm install request --save</strong></span>
</pre><p>Now that this has been done, the next step is to install a library called <a class="ulink" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/slackbots">
<code class="literal">slackbots</code>
</a> (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/slackbots">
https://www.npmjs.com/package/slackbots
</a>) that will act as an abstraction layer to deal with the Slack Real Time Messaging API:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>npm install slackbots --save</strong></span>
</pre><p>After doing this, our <code class="literal">package.json</code> file will be updated as follows:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00238.jpeg" alt="Setting up our Node.js app"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>With our Node.js bot settings all wired up, we are now ready to start writing some code.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Slackbots library basics" id="aid-11C3M1"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec27"/>Slackbots library basics</h1></div></div></div><p>As mentioned earlier, in order to interact with the Slack Real Time Messaging API, we'll be using a Node.js library (npm package) called <code class="literal">slackbots</code> (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/slackbots">
https://www.npmjs.com/package/slackbots
</a>).</p><p>Before we write any code, let's have a look at the main functions offered by this module by looking at the following short example:</p><pre class="programlisting">var Bot = require('slackbots'); 
 
var settings = { 
    token: 'API TOKEN', 
    name: 'quotebot' 
}; 
 
var bot = new Bot(settings); 
 
bot.on('start', function() { 
    bot.postMessageToChannel('channel-name', 'Hi channel.'); 
    bot.postMessageToUser('a-username', 'Hi user.'); 
    bot.postMessageToGroup('a-private-group', 'Hi private group.'); 
}); 
</pre><p>Before you run this code, please substitute the strings <code class="literal">channel-name</code>, <code class="literal">a-username</code> and <code class="literal">a-private-group</code> with your own values, taken from your Slack organization.</p><p>You'll also need to replace the <code class="literal">API TOKEN</code> string with the quotebot token you were given when the bot was created. The code should now look similar to this:</p><pre class="programlisting">var Bot = require('slackbots'); 
 
var settings = { 
    token: 'xoxb-.........-R7VVJ1FI5Hzfcyt.........', 
    name: 'quotebot' 
}; 
 
var bot = new Bot(settings); 
 
bot.on('start', function() { 
    bot.postMessageToChannel('general', 'Hi channel.'); 
    bot.postMessageToUser('radkiddo', 'Hi user.'); 
    bot.postMessageToGroup('tisdoksend', 'Hi private group.'); 
}); 
</pre><p>Once you have replaced those values, you can run the app from the command line as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>Node app.js</strong></span>
</pre><p>If you log in to Slack and open your team's page, you should be able to see this when you browse to the <span class="strong"><strong>#general</strong></span> channel:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00239.jpeg" alt="Slackbots library basics"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>Awesome, our quotebot just came to life with its first ever message! Now let's break the code down into pieces in order to understand it a bit better:</p><pre class="programlisting">var Bot = require('slackbots'); 
</pre><p>As you can see from the preceding code, the first thing we need to do is to require the Slackbot constructor. From there we can instantiate a new <code class="literal">Bot</code> object and add callbacks to specific events.</p><p>On this code, we use the <code class="literal">start</code> event that is triggered when the bot connects successfully to the Slack server:</p><pre class="programlisting">bot.on('start', function() { 
    bot.postMessageToChannel('general', 'Hi channel.'); 
    bot.postMessageToUser('radkiddo', 'Hi user.'); 
    bot.postMessageToGroup('tisdoksend', 'Hi private group.'); 
}); 
</pre><p>Then we can use the methods offered by the library to post a message in a channel using the <code class="literal">postMessageToChannel</code> method, to a user as a private message using <code class="literal">postMessageToUser</code>, or in a private group conversation by calling <code class="literal">postMessageToGroup</code>.</p><p>With these fundamentals covered, we can move on to explore the <a class="ulink" href="https://theysaidso.com/">They Said So</a> API, which is necessary in order to for us to build our bot.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="The They Said So API"><div class="titlepage" id="aid-12AK82"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec28"/>The They Said So API</h1></div></div></div><p>The They Said So service has a huge collection of quotes in their database and the <span class="strong"><strong>Quotes</strong></span> API is a great and convenient way to access this data. In order to consume the Quotes API, you'll first need to sign up for the service via this URL: <a class="ulink" href="https://theysaidso.com/register">
https://theysaidso.com/register
</a>.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00240.jpeg" alt="The They Said So API"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>Once you have entered your details and have registered, you will receive an automated verification e-mail, which will look like this:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00241.jpeg" alt="The They Said So API"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>When you receive this, simply click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Verify</strong></span> button in order to validate your newly registered account and start enjoying the service.</p><p>Once you've done that, you will shortly receive this e-mail:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00242.jpeg" alt="The They Said So API"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>The next step is to subscribe to the Quotes API in order to start consuming it. This can be done by visiting the following URL: <a class="ulink" href="https://theysaidso.com/api/#subscribe">
https://theysaidso.com/api/#subscribe
</a> or alternatively clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Create a great App using our API</strong></span> link from the e-mail received.</p><p>When you open this, scroll to the very bottom of the page and you will see the following API subscription plans on the screen.</p><p>In our case, because we are building a demo application, we won't sign up for any specific paid plan, but instead we'll consume the API through <span class="strong"><strong>Mashape </strong></span>(<a class="ulink" href="https://market.mashape.com/orthosie/they-said-so-say-it-with-style/">
https://market.mashape.com/orthosie/they-said-so-say-it-with-style/
</a>).</p><p>Mashape is a service that helps developers deliver better APIs and microservices. Many third-party APIs are provided through Mashape or similar services.</p><p>However, if you wish to get a paid plan, you may <span class="strong"><strong>Sign Up</strong></span> for any of the paid API options that the service offers. The advantage of doing this is that you won't need to sign on to Mashape in order to consume the API.</p><p>So when we use the API through Mashape, we can click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Consume API</strong></span> button at the bottom of the screen.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00243.jpeg" alt="The They Said So API"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>When we click on that button, the next thing we'll see is the following screenshot. Once there, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>PRICING</strong></span> tab.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00244.jpeg" alt="The They Said So API"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>On the <span class="strong"><strong>PRICING</strong></span> tab, under the <span class="strong"><strong>BASIC</strong></span> plan, click on the <span class="strong"><strong>SUBSCRIBE</strong></span> button.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00245.jpeg" alt="The They Said So API"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>When you click on the <span class="strong"><strong>SUBSCRIBE</strong></span> button, you'll see the following pop-up screen:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00246.jpeg" alt="The They Said So API"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>If you have a GitHub or Mashape account, you can simply subscribe to the API by logging into the service with any of those accounts. Otherwise you will have to create an account on Mashape.</p><p>The process anyway is very easy and straightforward. Once that's been done, we are ready to start exploring the API and consuming it. You'll see this on your screen:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00247.jpeg" alt="The They Said So API"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>Simply click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Explore public APIs</strong></span> button and then hit the back button on your browser or navigate to this URL: <a class="ulink" href="https://market.mashape.com/orthosie/they-said-so-say-it-with-style/">
https://market.mashape.com/orthosie/they-said-so-say-it-with-style/
</a> to start exploring the API. So let's do that.</p><p>From the API, we are interested in the quotes section. We can look at this by clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>GET Quote</strong></span> link on the left side of the screen.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00248.jpeg" alt="The They Said So API"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>This will take us to the following page, where we can see how to construct an API call in order to get a quote:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00249.jpeg" alt="The They Said So API"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>There are also multiple examples in various programming languages, including Node.js, which uses the Unirest library (<a class="ulink" href="http://unirest.io/">
http://unirest.io/
</a>) to make HTTP requests. In our application, we'll be using the Request library instead (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/request">
https://www.npmjs.com/package/request
</a>).</p><p>Notice how on all the sample code, including the Node.js one mentioned on the <span class="strong"><strong>GET Quote</strong></span> documentation page, the API Token key is passed on the header of the HTTP request as the value of the <code class="literal">X-Mashape-Key</code> parameter.</p><p>So let's see how we would be able to write a small example on how to retrieve a quote using the Request library.</p><p>Let's create a new file called <code class="literal">TestRequest.js </code>so we don't mix up this test code with the main quotebot code that we have started to write using <code class="literal">App.js</code>:</p><pre class="programlisting">var rq = require('request'); 
 
var token = 'Your They Said So API Key'; 
 
GetQuote = function() { 
  var options = { 
   url: 'https://theysaidso.p.mashape.com/quote?query=software', 
   headers: { 
      'User-Agent': 'request', 
      'X-Mashape-Key': token 
   } 
  }; 
 
  rq(options, function (error, response, body) { 
    if (!error &amp;&amp; response.statusCode == 200) { 
      console.log(body); 
    } 
  }) 
}; 
 
GetQuote(); 
</pre><p>Before you can run this, make sure you are subscribed to the <span class="strong"><strong>BASIC </strong></span> plan, which includes five calls per day. You will still have to enter a credit card number, which will be billed if you go over five requests per day.</p><p>You can always unsubscribe on this URL: <a class="ulink" href="https://market.mashape.com/orthosie/they-said-so-say-it-with-style/pricing">
https://market.mashape.com/orthosie/they-said-so-say-it-with-style/pricing
</a> by clicking on the <span class="strong"><strong>Unsubscribe</strong></span> link under the <span class="strong"><strong>BASIC</strong></span> plan.</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00250.jpeg" alt="The They Said So API"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>Now you may run this script from the command line as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>Node TestRequest.js</strong></span>
</pre><p>This produces the following result:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00251.jpeg" alt="The They Said So API"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>Now that we know how to interact both APIs, we can expand the basic code we initially wrote in order to create a full blown quotebot.</p><p>In our previous code snippet, we used the start event. Going forward, we'll also need the message event, which will be used to intercept an incoming message and based on that reply back.</p><p>We need to have a function that will intercept every real-time API message that is readable by our bot. This includes pretty much every chat message in any channel where the bot has been installed, and also private messages directed to the bot or other real-time notifications, such as a user typing in a channel, edited or deleted messages, users joining or leaving the channel, and so on.</p><p>Real-time API messages are not just chat messages, but any kind of event that occurs within our Slack organization. This is important to keep in mind.</p><p>Ideally, we would like the bot to filter all these events to detect public messages in channels that mention getquote or the name of the bot, and then we want to react to this message by replying with a random quote, fetched from the API we have subscribed using Mashape.</p><p>Ideally, we want to divide all these checks in a list of operations; this is exactly what we need to do. These are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Verify if the event represents a chat message</li><li class="listitem">Verify if the message comes from a user that is different from quotebot (to circular references and loops)</li><li class="listitem">Verify if the message mentions getquote</li></ul></div><p>The code would look as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">onMessage = function (msg) { 
    if (isChatMsg(msg) &amp;&amp; 
        !isFromQuoteBot(msg) &amp;&amp; 
        isMentioningQuote(msg)) { 
        replyWithRandomQuote(bot, msg); 
    } 
}; 
</pre><p>The <code class="literal">onMessage</code> function receives an <code class="literal">msg</code> object as a parameter. The <code class="literal">msg</code> contains all the information that describes the real-time event received through the Slack Real Time API.</p><p>Now let's look at each helper function, one by one:</p><pre class="programlisting">isChatMsg = function (msg) { 
    return msg.type === 'message'; 
}; 
</pre><p>This function verifies if a real-time event corresponds to an <code class="literal">msg</code> sent by a user. With our first helper function in place, let's have a look at the second one:</p><pre class="programlisting">isFromQuoteBot = function (msg) { 
    return msg.username === 'quotebot'; 
}; 
</pre><p>This helper function allows us to see if the <code class="literal">msg</code> comes from a user who is not the quotebot itself.</p><p>Last but not least, our final helper function checks if messages contain the string <code class="literal">getquote</code>. Without this verification we could potentially end up with an infinite loop of quotes:</p><pre class="programlisting">isMentioningQuote = function (msg) { 
    return msg.text.toLowerCase().indexOf('getquote') &gt; -1; 
}; 
</pre><p>With all the helper verification functions done, our random quote reply back method would look like this:</p><pre class="programlisting">replyWithRandomQuote = function (bot, oMsg) { 
  var options = { 
   url: 'https://theysaidso.p.mashape.com/quote?query=software', 
   headers: { 
      'User-Agent': 'request', 
      'X-Mashape-Key': token 
   } 
  }; 
   
  rq(options, function (error, response, body) { 
    
    if (!error &amp;&amp; response.statusCode == 200) { 
      bot.postMessageToChannel(bot.channels[0].name, body); 
    } 
  }) 
}; 
</pre><p>Finally, we tie it all together by passing the <code class="literal">onMessage</code> callback to the listening event as follows:</p><pre class="programlisting">bot.on('message', onMessage); 
</pre><p>The full code looks like this.</p><pre class="programlisting">var Bot = require('slackbots'); 
var rq = require('request'); 
 
var token = ' YOUR MASHAPE API TOKEN '; 
 
var settings = { 
    token: 'YOUR SLACK API TOKEN', 
    name: 'quotebot' 
}; 
 
var bot = new Bot(settings); 
 
isChatMsg = function (msg) { 
    return msg.type === 'message'; 
}; 
 
isFromQuoteBot = function (msg) { 
    return msg.username === 'quotebot'; 
}; 
 
isMentioningQuote = function (msg) { 
    return msg.text.toLowerCase().indexOf('getquote') &gt; -1; 
}; 
 
replyWithRandomQuote = function (bot, oMsg) { 
  var options = { 
    url: 'https://theysaidso.p.mashape.com/quote?query=software', 
    headers: { 
      'User-Agent': 'request', 
      'X-Mashape-Key': token 
    } 
  }; 
   
  rq(options, function (error, response, body) { 
    
    if (!error &amp;&amp; response.statusCode == 200) { 
      bot.postMessageToChannel(bot.channels[0].name, body); 
    } 
  }) 
}; 
 
bot.on('message', function (msg) { 
    if (isChatMsg(msg) &amp;&amp; 
        !isFromQuoteBot(msg) &amp;&amp; 
        isMentioningQuote(msg)) { 
        replyWithRandomQuote(bot, msg); 
    } 
}); 
</pre><p>In order to see this in action, simply message quotebot with the text <code class="literal">getquote</code> on Slack:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00252.jpeg" alt="The They Said So API"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>Once you do that, you will receive the following feedback on the <span class="strong"><strong>#general</strong></span> channel:</p><p>
</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../Images/image00253.jpeg" alt="The They Said So API"/></div><p style="clear:both; height: 1em;"> </p><p>
</p><p>That's awesome! Notice, however, that we have returned the full body response.</p><p>This could be further optimized and you could eventually parse the body response and just output the quote and the author, without any of the other details.</p><p>This is totally up to you and a nice exercise in order to improve this code. Further to this, you could also add additional code in order to process natural language, interpret more commands, and also to respond to different channels.</p><p>The possibilities are frankly endless and all that is needed is time, imagination, and dedication. We leave the challenge open for you to further expand and explore.</p></div>
