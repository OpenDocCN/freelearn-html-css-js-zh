    time to get them out of Clip Studio Paint and to the print shop or onto our social
    media or website. This last chapter will teach you about the exporting option

    homemade printing by adjusting the print settings and moving on to render a file
    in a printer-shop-friendly format, learning about the uniqueness of each file
    format. We will look closely at how to adjust image quality and file size, and
    how to resize the final image. Finally, we will learn how to export manga files
    for web uploads with an additional two useful EX version-only functions.

    books. This will give you a great idea of what your manga will finally look like

    doing the actual printing and binding everything together by yourself, but the
    artwork will give you a wonderful crafty feeling! In this section, we are going
    to learn how to make your manga creation ready for home printing.

- en: Over the past few years, home printers have become more affordable and more
    powerful. Just a decade ago, most home printers were only able to produce decent
    prints from digital photographs. Now, we have home printers that can print beautiful,
    high-quality images without breaking the bank. Some printers are even “artist-grade”
    now and can print in wide formats, on fabric, and more.
  id: totrans-19

- en: There are so many home printers now that we obviously can’t give a rundown of
    all of them in this book. It is best to do your own research before buying a printer
    and think about how you will use the printer. If you are mainly doing black and
    white prints, you can probably get away with a slightly less expensive printer
    or even a laser printer that uses toner instead of ink cartridges. If you are
    going to print lots of large prints, you may want to consider getting a wide-format
    printer. Printers can be set up with continuous ink systems to save on color ink
    costs for those who print lots of high-quality photographs or paintings. Read
    reviews online and compare the features of different printers before purchasing
    one. I recommend Canon or Epson printers for their fantastic art printing results!
    My favorite is the Canon PIXMA series for its quality and color expression.

    handy. Ink always runs out at the most inconvenient times! And it’s always safer
    to buy genuine cartridges, instead of compatible cheaper ones, because this extends
    your printer’s life.

- en: You will also want some high-quality paper. I like photo paper, cardstock, or
    presentation paper for my art prints, but thinner paper will work as well. Make
    sure that you don’t go too thin, however, because if we saturate a thin piece
    of paper with lots of ink, it will become wrinkled and warped, and the back of
    the page will be see-through!

    mode, so when we have finished creating our manga, we don’t need to convert our
    Clip Studio file at all to print from it. Ensure that your printer drivers are
    up to date, as this will solve most printer problems.

- en: In this chapter, we have learned how to take our art from Clip Studio Paint
    and change it into files that we can share with the world. First, we learned how
    to print our images from Clip Studio to our home printer. Then, we learned how
    to export our images to be sent to a print shop, copy shop, or publisher. We learned
    how to adjust the image quality and the dimensions, and how to export our images
    so that they display well on the internet. Then, we learned what a webtoon is
    and how to export this in the EX version, and we also learned about another great
    EX privilege – exporting batches of pages. Finally, we learned about a great Clip
    Studio Start service, Clip Studio SHARE, where you can create a virtual showcase
    of your manga.
