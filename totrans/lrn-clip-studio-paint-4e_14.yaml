    manga and illustrations. But did you know that it can also import and display
    3D assets? Many 3D assets come ready in the Material palette and can be applied
    to use 3D assets as poses or background references. In this chapter, we’ll take
    a trip into the third dimension and learn about the following topics:'

    The Material palette is what we call the digital library of assets that are available
    through Clip Studio. Clip Studio comes with a huge library of brushes, images,
    screentones, 3D poses, objects, and more. More assets can be easily downloaded
    through Clip Studio Assets, which we will cover in *Chapter 18*, *Exploring Clip
    Studio Assets and Animations*. You can also save your own artwork to the Material
    palette, which is covered in *Chapter 9*, *Material Palette and Inking Special
    Effects.* For now, however, we will just concentrate on the 3D categories of the
    Material palette. In the 3D category, we have character heads, 3D figures, figures
    in poses, hands in poses, furniture, picture frames, accessories, and more! They
    are all great references or can be used to stencil to create our manga.

    being too generic. In the example on the right, I added my twist to the finished
    image.

- en: This chapter took us deep into the third dimension and got us familiar with
    the 3D assets available in the Material palette. We learned how to add 3D assets
    to our canvas, as well as how to move them in the 3D space. We learned how to
    rotate and move our camera to give us a different perspective on 3D models. We
    also learned how to use saved poses from the Material palette, from picture or
    photo references, from the Posemaniacs website, and from the camera, as well as
    how to customize the character models that come with it. Then, we learned how
    to save our own 3D information as materials that we can use later. Finally, we
    learned how to import models from other 3D applications and how to turn those
    models into line drawings using the **Convert to lines and tones** and **Convert
    layer** options.

    we will begin by talking about the different ways to make color palettes in Clip
    Studio Paint, and how to use the eyedropper and **Sub View** palette to select
    colors.
