    server, somewhere in a computer center or some similar platform far away. This
    is sometimes a bit problematic because while developing a website or a web application
    on a remote server, you have to upload every changed file manually. In such a
    cases the working process is very long, programming some changes in your code,
    switching to the third-party FTP software, trying to remember which files you
    have just edited, selecting them, and then finally uploading them can be very
    annoying. When these files are uploaded you will be able to test the results of
    the changes in your developing project. Thus, there are many steps for every small
    change in your website or web application.*'

    You do not have to remember which files you have changed, you just have to make
    changes in your file and save it, that''s it! Aptana Studio realizes that you
    have changed a file and uses the sync functionality to upload your changes. All
    of this happens automatically.*'

    provider. Because we want to connect our project with FTP, we select the **FTP/SFTP/FTPS**
    option for our example, as seen in the following screenshot:![Time for action

    is to enter a name for your connection. This name should be related to the website
    or the web application so that you are able to identify the connection easily.

    After you have entered this data, you will be able to use another nice Aptana

    Studio tries to connect to the web server that you have just specified. In case
    Aptana Studio is able to connect to the web server, you will get an appropriate
    message; if not, you receive an error message from the internal FTP client. A
