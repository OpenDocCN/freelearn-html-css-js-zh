You may have some web development experience, and perhaps you've written some browser-based JavaScript in the past. It might not be obvious why anyone would want to take JavaScript out of the browser and use it for server-side development. However, this is exactly what Node.js does. What's more, Node.js has been around for long enough now to have matured as a platform, and has sustained its impressive growth in popularity well beyond any period that could be attributed to initial hype over a new technology.</p><p>The first objective of this book then is to explain why Node.js is a compelling technology that's worth learning more about. The first few chapters introduce Node.js with this in mind, quickly get you up and running with Node.js, and provide an important (re) introduction to the JavaScript language to set you on the right track.</p><p>The main part of this book will then take you through a worked example of building up a Node.js web-application step by step. In the process, we'll illustrate all the important tools and techniques required for real-world development projects in Node.js. The aim is to make the most of your existing development expertise to allow you to quickly reach the same level of best practices and professionalism with Node.js.</p><p>The final chapters of the book show how to use Node.js for other purposes outside of web applications and how to continue learning Node.js and exploring the ecosystem around it. We'll also see how you can use Node.js alongside .NET and benefit from applying your programming skills across both technologies.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 1. Why Node.js?" href="part0014.xhtml#aid-DB7S2">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Why Node.js?</em></span>, introduces Node.js as a programming platform. It covers the execution model of Node.js, particularly how it differs from .NET and Java, and the use cases in which these differences become strengths. This chapter also discusses the suitability of JavaScript as a development language.</p><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 2. Getting Started with Node.js" href="part0018.xhtml#aid-H5A41">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Getting Started with Node.js</em></span>, dives straight into creating a Node.js application.

<a class="link" title="Chapter 10. Creating Real-time Web Apps" href="part0058.xhtml#aid-1NA0K1">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating Real-time Web Apps</em></span>, shows how to implement real-time two-way communication between the client and the server. You'll use the Socket.IO library to add real-time functionality into your application. You'll also see how to write tests for this functionality and how to write scalable real-time applications using Redis as a backend.</p><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 11. Deploying Node.js Applications" href="part0066.xhtml#aid-1UU542">Chapter 11</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Deploying Node.js Applications</em></span>, demonstrates how to get a Node.js application onto the Web. You'll deploy your application to a free cloud-hosting provider. You'll see how to configure data stores and how to use remote server logs for debugging.</p><p>
<a class="link" title="Chapter 12. Authentication in Node.js" href="part0070.xhtml#aid-22O7C1">Chapter 12</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Authentication in Node.js</em></span>, covers authentication for Node.js web applications.

<a class="link" title="Chapter 14. Node.js and Beyond" href="part0081.xhtml#aid-2D7TI1">Chapter 14</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Node.js and Beyond</em></span>, puts the content of this book in a wider context. It explains how Node.js and JavaScript are continuing to evolve, so you can be prepared for and take advantage of upcoming changes. It covers some alternative programming languages for Node.js and the Web, and how these relate to JavaScript. It discusses how some of the principles from Node.js can be applied to .NET programming, and illustrates how these are particularly visible in .NET Core (the new version of .NET). It also shows how you can use Node.js together with .NET to gain the best of both worlds.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="What you need for this book" id="aid-8IL21"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>All of the tools and services used in this book are available for free online. Most of the worked examples require an active web connection at some point. To get started, you need nothing more than a console, a web browser, and permission to install new software on your machine. To support developers coming from a .NET background, some of the console listings or example steps in this book use Windows conventions (for example, backslashes in paths). None of the examples depend on Windows specifically though. You can work through this book on Windows, Mac OSX, or Linux.</p></div>
