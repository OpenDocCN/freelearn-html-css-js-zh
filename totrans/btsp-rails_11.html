Throughout the book, we have gone through various Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript components that come ready to use out of the box.</p><p>In this chapter, we will see how to extend Bootstrap framework and add our own style to it. There are still many important components that are missing from the Bootstrap framework. We will check out some of the popular Bootstrap plugins that are available for free.</p><p>The topics that we will cover are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Adding Bootstrap-sass to a Rails Application</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Customizing Bootstrap through variables</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Adding Bootstrap-sass to a Rails application"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec56"/>Adding Bootstrap-sass to a Rails application</h1></div></div></div><p>In the <span class="emphasis"><em>Installing Bootstrap in the Rails project</em></span>, section in <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Introducing Bootstrap 3">chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Introducing Bootstrap 3</em></span> we saw <a id="id374" class="indexterm"/>how to include Bootstrap into <a id="id375" class="indexterm"/>our Rails application through three different ways:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The CDN method</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Bootstrap-sass gem</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">By downloading Bootstrap files</li></ul></div><p>To quicken things up, we had opted for the<a id="id376" class="indexterm"/> CDN method. Well, in this chapter, we are going to use Bootstrap through Bootstrap-sass gem. This will enable us to completely customize the Bootstrap's default styles. So, let's proceed and install <code class="literal">Bootstrap-sass gem</code> in our application:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Go to the <code class="literal">application</code> folder and edit the file <code class="literal">Gemfile</code> using a text editor. Add the following two lines of code at the end of this file:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">gem 'bootstrap-sass', '~&gt; 3.3.1'
gem 'autoprefixer-rails'</pre></div></li><li class="listitem">The above two lines will install <code class="literal">bootstrap-sass</code> and <code class="literal">autoprefixer-rails gems</code> into your application. The <code class="literal">autoprefixer-rails</code> is needed to automatically append browser vendor prefixes in the CSS <code class="literal">stylesheets</code>.</li><li class="listitem">Let's bundle the application, so that the above gems are actually downloaded and installed in our application.<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">
<span class="strong"><strong>bundle install</strong></span>
</pre></div></li><li class="listitem">Once the execution of the above command is complete, navigate to the <code class="literal">app</code> | <code class="literal">assets</code> | <code class="literal">stylesheets</code> folder. Rename the <code class="literal">application.css</code> file to the <code class="literal">application.css.scss</code> file. Next, remove the imported CDN link<a id="id377" class="indexterm"/> from the file, which was included by us earlier.</li><li class="listitem">Now, we need to<a id="id378" class="indexterm"/> include Bootstrap files that are downloaded through gem inside the <code class="literal">application.css.scss</code> file. To do that, include the following 2 lines:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">@import "bootstrap-sprockets";
@import "bootstrap";</pre></div><p>The <code class="literal">bootstrap-sprockets</code> value is needed to correctly link the font files with the Bootstrap's CSS files.</p></li></ol></div><p>It's time to link the Bootstrap's JavaScript files using the recently gem:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">First, we need to remove the hardcoded Bootstrap's JavaScript CDN link from the <code class="literal">application.html.erb</code> file, present in the <code class="literal">layouts</code> folder by navigating to <code class="literal">app</code> | <code class="literal">views</code> | <code class="literal">layouts</code> folder. Remove the following line from this file:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">&lt;script src="//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.2.0/js/bootstrap.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre></div></li><li class="listitem">Next, go to the JavaScript folder by navigating to <code class="literal">app</code> | <code class="literal">assets</code> | <code class="literal">javascript</code> folder and edit the <code class="literal">application.js</code> file. Add the following line immediately after the jQuery line:<div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">//= require bootstrap-sprockets</pre></div></li><li class="listitem">Finally, we are done. If you reopen your application in the browser, you can see that everything is working, just like before.</li></ol></div></div></div>
<div class="section" title="Customizing Bootstrap through variables"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec57"/>Customizing Bootstrap through variables</h1></div></div></div><p>Most of the visible Bootstrap styles can be overridden simply by using pre-defined Bootstrap variables. Before proceeding, you should understand that Bootstrap was initially compatible with LESS only. They have later <a id="id379" class="indexterm"/>ported it to the Sass version.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note05"/>Note</h3><p>LESS and Sass are CSS preprocessors that help us to organize and write scalable CSS styles. Both of them are very similar to each other in syntax and differ only by the additional features that one has and the other doesn't.</p></div></div><p>Hence, all the variables present in the LESS version remain the same in the Sass version, as well. Bootstrap hasn't provided a dedicated page for the list of variables present in Sass, however, you can find the list of variables in<a id="id380" class="indexterm"/> the LESS version on their official website (<a class="ulink" href="http://getbootstrap.com/customize/#less-variables">http://getbootstrap.com/customize/#less-variables</a>). Let's proceed and change some of the default Bootstrap styles.</p><p>In our application, we have used <code class="literal">.btn-success</code> at various places. So, let's change some of the CSS styles in it. Re-open the <code class="literal">application.css.scss</code> file, and add the following lines before the Bootstrap's import line:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">$btn-success-color: #333;
$btn-success-bg: #AEDBAE;
$btn-success-border: darken($btn-success-bg, 5%);</pre></div><p>We can change the style of the <code class="literal">.btn-success</code> class completely through the <code class="literal">$btn-success-color</code>, <code class="literal">$btn-success-bg</code>, and <code class="literal">$btn-success-border</code> Bootstrap Sass variables. In the above code, I have changed the text color of the button to <code class="literal">#333</code>. I have also lightened the background color to a new HEX color, and finally changed the border color using the darken color function in Sass.</p><p>You can go through the whole list of available variables and make the customizations accordingly. You can also include the available Bootstrap theme by adding the following line in the <code class="literal">application.css.scss</code> file:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">@import "bootstrap/theme";</pre></div><p>The <code class="literal">bootstrap/theme</code> is the official Bootstrap's default style customized from Bootstrap's theme. It comes with some cool styles and you should try using it.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec58"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>Bootstrap customization can help you create a visually different looking website. If you are a designer in the Rails application development team, this is the field you must master. In this chapter, we saw how to include Bootstrap-sass gem in a Rails application. We also understood what it takes to override the default Bootstrap styles through pre-defined variables. I hope you found this useful.</p><p>In the end, if you still have questions related to using Bootstrap in Rails applications shoot me a tweet <code class="literal">@fazlerocks</code>, I will be happy to help you!</p></div></body></html>
