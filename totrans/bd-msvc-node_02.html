			<h1 id="_idParaDest-37"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"/>Overview of the core principles of microservices</h1>
			<p>In this section, we’re going<a id="_idIndexMarker073"/> learn about the core principles of microservices. Microservices are organized around specific business capabilities and communicate<a id="_idIndexMarker074"/> with one another through well-defined <strong class="bold">application programming interfaces</strong> (<strong class="bold">APIs</strong>). The core principles of microservices revolve around autonomy, bounded context, decentralization, <span class="No-Break">and resilience.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s explore each of these principles<a id="_idIndexMarker075"/> in <span class="No-Break">more detail:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Autonomy</strong>: Each microservice within a system is designed to be autonomous. It means that each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently without relying on other services. Autonomy allows development teams to work independently, choose appropriate technologies, and make decisions regarding the <span class="No-Break">service implementation.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Bounded context</strong>: Bounded context refers to the concept of defining<a id="_idIndexMarker076"/> clear boundaries and responsibilities for each microservice. Each service should have a specific business domain or functionality it focuses on. By defining these boundaries, the services can be developed and maintained independently, reducing dependencies <span class="No-Break">and complexity.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Decentralization</strong>: Microservices promote decentralization by distributing the system’s functionality across multiple services. Rather than building a monolithic application, microservices enable breaking down the system into smaller, manageable components. This distribution of functionality allows teams to develop and deploy services independently, enabling faster development and <span class="No-Break">deployment cycles.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Resilience</strong>: Resilience is a crucial principle of microservices, as failures in a distributed system are inevitable. Microservices are designed to handle failures gracefully and recover from them without affecting the overall system. Services are expected to be fault-tolerant, and failures are isolated within the affected service, minimizing the impact on <span class="No-Break">other services.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Some additional principles<a id="_idIndexMarker077"/> and best<a id="_idIndexMarker078"/> practices associated with microservices include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Single responsibility</strong>: Each microservice should have a single responsibility or do one thing well. This principle helps in keeping services focused <span class="No-Break">and manageable.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Communication via APIs</strong>: Microservices communicate with one another through well-defined APIs, typically<a id="_idIndexMarker079"/> using lightweight protocols such as <strong class="bold">representational state transfer</strong> (<strong class="bold">REST</strong>) or messaging systems such as RabbitMQ or <span class="No-Break">Apache Kafka.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data management</strong>: Each microservice should have its own database or data store, keeping data private to that service. This ensures loose coupling between services and prevents data <span class="No-Break">access complexities.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Infrastructure automation</strong>: Microservices benefit from infrastructure<a id="_idIndexMarker080"/> automation practices such as <strong class="bold">continuous integration/continuous deployment </strong>(<strong class="bold">CI/CD</strong>), containerization, and orchestration tools such as Docker <span class="No-Break">and Kubernetes.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Monitoring and observability</strong>: Monitoring and observability are essential for microservices to gain<a id="_idIndexMarker081"/> insights into the system’s performance, health, and issues. Logging, metrics, and distributed tracing are key tools to achieve observability in a <span class="No-Break">microservices architecture.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Evolutionary design</strong>: Microservices should be designed with the expectation of change. The architecture should be flexible enough to accommodate new features, scale, and evolving business requirements without disrupting <span class="No-Break">other services.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Understanding these principles<a id="_idIndexMarker082"/> is of great value for doing good work with microservices. These principles help you a lot to find a solution for every problem while you don’t waste time using old methodologies. With microservices, you will always do a great job, you can finish work on time, and debugging is so <span class="No-Break">much easier.</span></p>

			<p>By adhering to these core<a id="_idIndexMarker083"/> principles, development teams can create scalable, modular, and maintainable software systems using the microservices <span class="No-Break">architectural style.</span></p>
			<p>Now that we have an understanding of the core principles of microservices, let’s move on to their fundamentals and business capabilities in the <span class="No-Break">next section.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-38"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"/>Understanding the fundamentals and identifying business capabilities</h1>
			<p>Understanding the fundamentals<a id="_idIndexMarker084"/> and identifying the business<a id="_idIndexMarker085"/> capabilities of microservices are crucial steps in designing an effective microservices architecture. It involves analyzing the application’s requirements, breaking down the system into smaller functional components, and identifying the individual business capabilities that each microservice <span class="No-Break">will encapsulate.</span></p>
			<p>Here are the key steps to understanding the fundamentals and identifying the business capabilities <span class="No-Break">of microservices:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Domain-driven design</strong> (<strong class="bold">DDD</strong>): DDD is an approach that emphasizes<a id="_idIndexMarker086"/> modeling the domain (business problem) in the application’s design. It involves collaborating with domain experts and stakeholders to gain a deep understanding of the business requirements, rules, <span class="No-Break">and processes.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Decomposition of monolithic systems</strong>: If you are migrating from a monolithic architecture to microservices, you will need to analyze the monolithic application’s functionalities and break it down into smaller functional components. Each component can then potentially become <span class="No-Break">a microservice.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Bounded contexts</strong>: In DDD, bounded contexts define clear boundaries around specific business capabilities. You will need to identify the bounded contexts in your application and consider them as candidates <span class="No-Break">for microservices.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Identification of business capabilities</strong>: Within each bounded context, you should identify the core business capabilities that need to be handled by microservices. These capabilities represent specific functionalities or services that microservices <span class="No-Break">will provide.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Independence and autonomy</strong>: You must ensure that each microservice has a clear and independent responsibility, encapsulating a single business capability. This autonomy allows each service to be developed, deployed, and <span class="No-Break">scaled independently.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Loose coupling</strong>: Microservices should have minimal dependencies on other services to achieve loose coupling. You need to identify the relationships and dependencies between different business capabilities and design <span class="No-Break">services accordingly.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Team ownership</strong>: You must assign ownership of each microservice to a specific team. Teams should be cross functional and include all the skills necessary to develop, deploy, and maintain <span class="No-Break">the microservice.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">API design</strong>: You should define clear and well-documented APIs for each microservice, specifying how other services or clients can interact with the capabilities <span class="No-Break">it offers.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Shared libraries and components</strong>: You need to identify common functionality or shared components that can be used across multiple microservices to promote code reuse <span class="No-Break">and consistency.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scalability considerations</strong>: You should analyze the scalability requirements of each business capability to determine if it should be implemented as a separate microservice. Some capabilities may have higher demands and benefit from being <span class="No-Break">independently scalable.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data management</strong>: You must consider the data needs of each business capability and decide whether each microservice will have its own database or if data should be shared between services through events or <span class="No-Break">other mechanisms.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Understanding the fundamentals<a id="_idIndexMarker087"/> and identifying business capabilities<a id="_idIndexMarker088"/> are crucial steps in building a successful microservices architecture. It involves gaining a deep understanding of the application’s requirements and breaking down the system into smaller, <span class="No-Break">manageable components.</span></p>
			<p>By understanding the fundamental aspects and identifying the business capabilities of microservices, you can design a scalable, maintainable, and resilient microservices architecture that aligns with the specific needs of your application and supports the agility and flexibility required for modern <span class="No-Break">software development.</span></p>
			<p>In the next section, we’ll learn about defining service contracts and decentralized <span class="No-Break">decision making.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-39"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/>Defining service contracts and decentralized decision making</h1>
			<p>Service contracts in microservices <a id="_idIndexMarker089"/>refer to the agreements and expectations that services establish with one another. Meanwhile, decentralized decision making is a fundamental principle of microservices architecture that empowers individual development teams to make decisions independently. Let’s learn about these concepts in detail. We’ll start with service contracts <span class="No-Break">in microservices.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/>Service contracts in microservices</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Service contracts in microservices</strong> refer to the agreements and expectations<a id="_idIndexMarker090"/> that services establish with one another. They define how different microservices interact, communicate, and exchange data. Service contracts play a crucial role in ensuring that microservices can work together seamlessly, even when they are developed and <span class="No-Break">deployed independently.</span></p>
			<p>The common types of service contracts include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">API contracts</strong>: API contracts define the interfaces<a id="_idIndexMarker091"/> and data formats that microservices<a id="_idIndexMarker092"/> use to communicate. They include details about the request and response payloads, endpoints, authentication requirements, and <span class="No-Break">supported operations.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Behavioral contracts</strong>: Behavioral contracts specify the expected<a id="_idIndexMarker093"/> behavior and interactions<a id="_idIndexMarker094"/> of a microservice. They may include rules about error handling, response times, and <span class="No-Break">business logic.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Versioning contracts</strong>: As microservices evolve, it is essential<a id="_idIndexMarker095"/> to have versioning contracts that allow<a id="_idIndexMarker096"/> backward compatibility. They ensure that changes to a microservice’s contract do not break the <span class="No-Break">existing consumers.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data contracts</strong>: Data contracts outline the structure<a id="_idIndexMarker097"/> and validation rules<a id="_idIndexMarker098"/> for the data exchanged between microservices. They ensure that the services understand each other’s data format and avoid <span class="No-Break">data inconsistencies.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Security contracts</strong>: Security contracts define the security<a id="_idIndexMarker099"/> requirements and constraints for interacting with a microservice. They include authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive data <span class="No-Break">and resources.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Service-level agreements (SLAs)</strong>: SLAs specify the expected<a id="_idIndexMarker100"/> levels of service performance, availability, and response times <span class="No-Break">between microservices.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are the most common service contracts used in microservices architecture. It enables the developers to guide a project better. In the context of microservices architecture, service contracts refer to the well-defined agreements and specifications that govern how microservices communicate with each other. These contracts define the input and output formats, protocols, data types, and error-handling mechanisms that services adhere to when interacting with one another. Clear and well-defined service contracts are crucial for ensuring seamless communication and collaboration <span class="No-Break">between microservices.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 2</em></span><em class="italic">.2</em> shows the service contracts in a <span class="No-Break">graphical manner:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.2: Service contracts</p>
			<p>By adhering to well-defined<a id="_idIndexMarker101"/> service contracts, microservices can communicate effectively, enabling a modular, scalable, and maintainable system. These contracts provide a clear interface for each microservice, allowing them to evolve independently without disrupting other parts of <span class="No-Break">the system.</span></p>
			<p>With the most common service contracts under our belt, let’s now take a look at the principle of decentralizing decision making in a <span class="No-Break">microservices architecture.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>Decentralized decision making in microservices</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Decentralizing decision making</strong> is a fundamental principle of<a id="_idIndexMarker102"/> microservices architecture that empowers individual development teams to make decisions independently. This approach promotes agility, autonomy, and faster <span class="No-Break">development cycles.</span></p>
			<p>The key aspects of decentralized decision making<a id="_idIndexMarker103"/> are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Autonomous teams</strong>: Each microservice is owned and managed by a dedicated team that has full control over its development, deployment, <span class="No-Break">and operations.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Domain-oriented teams</strong>: Teams are organized around specific business domains or capabilities, giving them deep expertise and a clear understanding of the microservices they are <span class="No-Break">responsible for.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Technology stack choice</strong>: Teams have the freedom to choose their preferred technology stack, programming languages, frameworks, and tools that best suit the needs of <span class="No-Break">their microservices.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Service independence</strong>: Decentralization ensures that each microservice can evolve independently without impacting other services, reducing the risk of interdependencies <span class="No-Break">and bottlenecks.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Fast feedback loops</strong>: Short feedback loops allow teams to iterate quickly and make informed decisions based on real-time data and <span class="No-Break">user feedback.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Collaboration and communication</strong>: While teams operate autonomously, collaboration and communication between teams are vital for shared understanding and avoiding <span class="No-Break">duplicated efforts.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Consistency through contracts</strong>: Service contracts act as a mechanism to ensure that services can interact cohesively despite <span class="No-Break">their autonomy.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Decentralized decision making enables microservices to scale effectively, fosters innovation, and enables teams to respond rapidly to changing requirements. However, it requires strong communication, coordination, and a shared vision across the organization to ensure that the overall architecture aligns with the <span class="No-Break">business goals.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 2</em></span><em class="italic">.3</em> shows the diagram of a <span class="No-Break">decentralized architecture:</span></p>

			<p>Defining service contracts and decentralizing decision making are key principles in microservices architecture that promote effective communication <span class="No-Break">and agility.</span></p>
			<p>By defining service contracts and decentralizing decision making, microservices architecture can achieve effective communication, adaptability, and responsiveness, ensuring that the system evolves<a id="_idIndexMarker104"/> gracefully to meet changing business needs and <span class="No-Break">technological advancements.</span></p>
			<p>In the next section, we’ll see how to prioritize autonomy and ownership and how to design microservices <span class="No-Break">for resilience.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-42"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/>Prioritizing autonomy and ownership and designing for resilience</h1>
			<p>Prioritizing autonomy and ownership and designing for resilience are two essential principles in microservices architecture that contribute to the success and effectiveness of the system. Let’s explore these principles <span class="No-Break">in detail.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor044"/>Prioritizing autonomy and ownership</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Autonomy and ownership</strong> in microservices refer to empowering<a id="_idIndexMarker105"/> individual development<a id="_idIndexMarker106"/> teams with the responsibility for designing, developing, deploying, and maintaining their respective microservices. This principle allows teams to have control over their microservices and fosters a sense of ownership <span class="No-Break">and accountability.</span></p>
			<p>Some key aspects of prioritizing<a id="_idIndexMarker107"/> autonomy and ownership <a id="_idIndexMarker108"/>include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Domain-oriented teams</strong>: Organize teams around specific business domains or capabilities, enabling them to have deep expertise in the areas they are <span class="No-Break">responsible for.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">End-to-end responsibility</strong>: Development teams take full ownership of the entire lifecycle of their microservices, from development to production. This includes monitoring, troubleshooting, <span class="No-Break">and scaling.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Technology freedom</strong>: Give teams the freedom to choose their preferred technology stack, tools, and development practices that best suit their <span class="No-Break">microservices’ requirements.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Fast iteration</strong>: Empower teams to iterate quickly by removing bureaucratic hurdles and providing a streamlined development and <span class="No-Break">deployment process.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cross-functional teams</strong>: Teams should be cross functional, including developers, testers, operations, and other necessary roles to <span class="No-Break">ensure self-sufficiency.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>These key concepts for autonomy and ownership develop an entrepreneurial spirit in specialists, and every specialist, after mastering these concepts, will be better and more autonomous at work while considering the product as <span class="No-Break">their own.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 2</em></span><em class="italic">.4</em> depicts an <span class="No-Break">autonomous architecture:</span></p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.4: Autonomous architecture</p>
			<p>In <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 2</em></span><em class="italic">.4</em>, <strong class="bold">Payments</strong> and <strong class="bold">Services</strong> are microservices that rely on autonomous<a id="_idIndexMarker109"/> architecture while connecting to their <span class="No-Break">respective database.</span></p>
			<p>By prioritizing autonomy<a id="_idIndexMarker110"/> and ownership, microservices architecture can achieve<a id="_idIndexMarker111"/> greater agility, faster time-to-market, and improved innovation. Teams can respond quickly to business changes and make data-driven decisions for <span class="No-Break">their microservices.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>Designing for resilience</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Designing for resilience</strong> in microservices focuses on building<a id="_idIndexMarker112"/> a system that can withstand and recover gracefully from failures, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance. In a distributed microservices environment, failures are inevitable, so resilience <span class="No-Break">is critical.</span></p>
			<p>Some key aspects<a id="_idIndexMarker113"/> of designing for resilience include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Redundancy</strong>: Deploy multiple instances of critical microservices to ensure redundancy and avoid single points <span class="No-Break">of failure.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Circuit breakers</strong>: Implement circuit breakers to isolate failing services and prevent cascading failures across <span class="No-Break">the system.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Bulkheads</strong>: Use bulkheads to separate different parts of the system, ensuring that a failure in one part does not affect the <span class="No-Break">entire system.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Graceful degradation</strong>: Design services to degrade gracefully in the face of high load or failures, prioritizing <span class="No-Break">critical functionalities.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Timeouts and retries</strong>: Implement appropriate timeouts and retries for service-to-service communication to handle temporary <span class="No-Break">network issues.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Distributed tracing and logging</strong>: Use distributed tracing and centralized logging to gain insights into the interactions and behaviors of microservices, aiding in debugging <span class="No-Break">and monitoring.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Chaos engineering</strong>: Conduct controlled experiments, such as chaos engineering, to test the system’s resilience under real-world <span class="No-Break">failure scenarios.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>By designing for resilience, microservices architecture can maintain a high level of availability and provide a better user experience, even in the presence of failures or <span class="No-Break">unpredictable conditions.</span></p>
			<p><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 2</em></span><em class="italic">.5</em> shows the design for a <span class="No-Break">resilient system:</span></p>

			<p>Prioritizing autonomy and ownership and designing for resilience work hand in hand to create a robust, adaptive, and reliable microservices ecosystem. These principles help teams work efficiently, foster a culture of ownership and responsibility, and deliver a resilient system that meets the demands of modern software applications. In conclusion, prioritizing autonomy and ownership allows development teams to work independently and take ownership of their microservices, fostering agility and innovation. Designing for resilience ensures that the microservices ecosystem remains robust and reliable, enhancing overall performance and user satisfaction. By adhering to these principles, microservices<a id="_idIndexMarker115"/> architecture can deliver scalable, adaptable, and resilient systems that meet the demands of modern applications and provide a competitive edge in <span class="No-Break">the market.</span></p>
			<p>Next, we’ll explore strategies for communicating effectively and <span class="No-Break">ensuring scalability.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor046"/>Implementing communication strategies and ensuring scalability</h1>
			<p>Implementing effective communication strategies and ensuring scalability are crucial aspects of microservices architecture that contribute to the seamless operation and growth of the system. Let’s delve into these <span class="No-Break">two areas:</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"/>Implementing communication strategies</h2>
			<p>In a microservices architecture, services<a id="_idIndexMarker116"/> need to communicate with one another to fulfill various functionalities. Proper communication strategies ensure that services can interact efficiently <span class="No-Break">and reliably.</span></p>
			<p>Some common communication patterns in microservices include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Synchronous communication</strong>: This involves direct request-response communication between microservices. It can be achieved through HTTP/HTTPS or gRPC-based APIs. However, it can lead to tight coupling between services and may result in cascading failures during <span class="No-Break">high traffic.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Asynchronous communication</strong>: Asynchronous communication decouples microservices, allowing them to work independently without waiting for responses. Message queues or event streaming platforms, such as Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ, facilitate <span class="No-Break">asynchronous communication.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Event-driven architecture</strong>: Microservices can communicate through events, where one service publishes events and other services subscribe to and react to those events. This pattern promotes loose coupling <span class="No-Break">and scalability.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">API gateway</strong>: An API gateway acts as a single entry point for clients to access multiple microservices. It centralizes request handling and load balancing and can provide additional <span class="No-Break">security features.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Service discovery</strong>: Service discovery mechanisms allow microservices to locate and communicate with each other dynamically. This is particularly useful in a dynamic environment where service instances may scale up <span class="No-Break">or down.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Circuit breaker</strong>: Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures when a service is down or experiencing high latency. It isolates the failing service and provides fallback responses <span class="No-Break">when necessary.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Implementing effective communication<a id="_idIndexMarker117"/> strategies is a critical way for the system to run in a perfect manner, without errors, and to assure availability. Every developer should design a system that communicates with services in a <span class="No-Break">perfect way.</span></p>
			<p>Next, to ensure the best coordination between microservices, we will learn <span class="No-Break">about scalability.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"/>Ensuring scalability</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Scalability</strong> is essential to handle varying workloads<a id="_idIndexMarker118"/> and ensure that a system can grow to meet <span class="No-Break">increasing demands.</span></p>
			<p>Consider the following strategies<a id="_idIndexMarker119"/> for ensuring scalability <span class="No-Break">in microservices:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Horizontal scaling</strong>: Scale microservices horizontally by adding more instances of a service to distribute the load. Container orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes can help with <span class="No-Break">dynamic scaling.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Stateless services</strong>: Design microservices to be stateless, meaning they don’t store any session or client-specific data. This allows them to be easily replicated <span class="No-Break">and scaled.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Load balancing</strong>: Load balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of a service to ensure optimal resource utilization and avoid overloading <span class="No-Break">individual instances.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Shared-nothing architecture</strong>: Aim for a shared-nothing architecture, where each microservice has its own dedicated resources and does not rely on shared databases or storage. This avoids bottlenecks and <span class="No-Break">contention points.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Caching</strong>: Implement caching for frequently accessed data to reduce the load on databases and improve <span class="No-Break">response times.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Auto-scaling</strong>: Use auto-scaling mechanisms to automatically adjust the number of instances based on real-time demand, ensuring optimal <span class="No-Break">resource utilization.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Database sharding</strong>: For databases, consider sharding data across multiple nodes to distribute the load<a id="_idIndexMarker120"/> and improve <span class="No-Break">database performance.</span></li>

			<p>Database sharding is a great practice<a id="_idIndexMarker123"/> to develop while thinking in microservices. As shown in <span class="No-Break"><em class="italic">Figure 2</em></span><em class="italic">.7</em>, every service has its own database and it displays its information on user request. If one service fails, the others should work correctly, regardless of the one that <span class="No-Break">has failed.</span></p>

These principles are essential in creating a resilient and high-performing <span class="No-Break">microservices architecture.</span></p>
			<p>By implementing efficient communication strategies and ensuring scalability, microservices can work together seamlessly, handle varying workloads, and adapt to changing business needs. These practices<a id="_idIndexMarker125"/> support the development of responsive, high-performing, and reliable microservices architectures that align with modern software <span class="No-Break">application requirements.</span></p>
			<p>To wrap up this chapter, we’ll learn about two crucial practices in microservice architecture: observability and continuous learning <span class="No-Break">and improvement.</span></p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/>Implementing observability and continuously learning and improving</h1>
			<p>Implementing observability and continuously learning and improving are critical practices in microservices architecture to gain insights into the system’s behavior, monitor its health, and make data-driven decisions for ongoing enhancements. Let’s explore <span class="No-Break">each aspect.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>Implementing observability</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Observability</strong> in microservices refers to the ability <a id="_idIndexMarker126"/>to gain deep insights into the internal workings of the system through monitoring, logging, and distributed tracing. It helps in understanding the system’s performance, identifying bottlenecks, diagnosing issues, and <span class="No-Break">ensuring reliability.</span></p>
			<p>The key aspects of implementing observability include <span class="No-Break">the following:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Monitoring</strong>: Set up comprehensive monitoring systems to collect real-time data on key metrics such as response times, error rates, CPU and memory usage, and <span class="No-Break">service availability.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Logging</strong>: Implement structured logging to capture meaningful information about the behavior of microservices and the flow of requests <span class="No-Break">between services.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Distributed tracing</strong>: Use distributed tracing to track requests as they flow through multiple microservices, allowing you to identify latency and performance issues across <span class="No-Break">service boundaries.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Metrics Aggregation</strong>: Aggregate metrics and logs centrally using tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana), or other <span class="No-Break">observability platforms.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Alerting and notifications</strong>: Set up proactive alerts based on predefined thresholds to be notified when specific metrics or events deviate from the <span class="No-Break">expected behavior.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Dashboards and visualization</strong>: Create informative dashboards and visualizations to provide a clear overview of the system’s health and performance to both developers <span class="No-Break">and stakeholders.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Observability plays a crucial<a id="_idIndexMarker127"/> role while programming in microservices because it helps developers have a 360-degree dashboard about how their application is being used. Also, they can apply this knowledge to improve the application, as explained in the <span class="No-Break">following section.</span></p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor051"/>Continuous learning and improving</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Continuous learning and improvement</strong> are essential for the success of a<a id="_idIndexMarker128"/> microservices-based application. This involves using data, feedback, and user insights to make informed decisions and iteratively enhance <span class="No-Break">the system.</span></p>
			<p>The key aspects of continuous<a id="_idIndexMarker129"/> learning and improvement are <span class="No-Break">as follows:</span></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Feedback loops</strong>: Establish feedback loops to gather insights from users, stakeholders, and developers to understand pain points and areas <span class="No-Break">of improvement.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Data-driven decisions</strong>: Make decisions based on empirical evidence and data gathered through observability. Use metrics and performance data to identify areas <span class="No-Break">for optimization.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Retrospectives</strong>: Conduct regular retrospectives to reflect on past iterations and identify what worked well and what <span class="No-Break">needs improvement.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Experimentation</strong>: Encourage experimentation, such as A/B testing, to test new features or changes in a controlled manner and make decisions based on <span class="No-Break">measurable outcomes.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Iterative development</strong>: Embrace an iterative development approach, allowing frequent releases and continuous improvement based on user feedback and <span class="No-Break">business needs.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Post-mortems</strong>: Conduct post-mortems to analyze and learn from any major incidents or outages, identifying root causes and <span class="No-Break">preventive measures.</span></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Adaptive architecture</strong>: Continuously assess the microservices architecture to ensure it aligns with evolving business<a id="_idIndexMarker130"/> requirements and <span class="No-Break">technological advancements.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Knowing the basics of these concepts and applying them is a great way to improve the application. The application will be better and the user will <span class="No-Break">feel happier.</span></p>
