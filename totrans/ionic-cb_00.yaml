- en: Mobile application development has been a hot topic for quite a while now. There
    are multiple platforms and devices with different screen sizes and form factors
    out there to accommodate. It makes mobile app development very difficult. Luckily,
    Ionic is one such tool that helps us mitigate this very problem by allowing us
    to write code once for all platforms and devices.

- en: In this book, readers will learn how to create mobile applications using Ionic.
    We will start with very basic things, such as setting up the development environment,
    using Navigation in apps, working with backend via REST API, Animations, Authenticating
    Users, Receiving push notifications, localizing an app, generating documentation,
    and publishing the app, to name a few. Readers will also learn things about Angular
    and Ionic CLI. I hope that this book will help novice developers as well as advanced
    developers, because the content is a mixture of easy and advance ionic stuff.

- en: Ionic Cookbook is for front-end developers who want to create cross-platform
    mobile apps. This book will help you become a Mobile App developer who is comfortable
    enough to take on difficult apps by teaching readers about Angular, Cordova, and
    Sass in depth. The intention of this book is to teach Ionic by solving real-world
    problems like authentication, push notifications, using the camera to name a few.
    Nevertheless, if you are new to front-end development, you will still be able
    to follow the book.

    the problem that you will face will be regarding Angular instead of Ionic. [https://angular.io](https://angular.io)
