<p>Our NodeBots can now sense and display information about the world around them, and gather information from the internet for display. Now, it's time to look at NodeBots talking to each other. We will also use this chapter to talk about where to go from here—JavaScript is available on so many different boards and devices, and in so many new and exciting ways!</p>
<p>The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Project – connecting multiple NodeBots</li>
<li>Expanding your NodeBots knowledge</li>
<li>Continuing on your NodeBots adventure</li>
</ul>

<p>For this chapter, you can optionally use a second Raspberry Pi with Wireless internet access. You can also just use the one you have and we'll pretend it is two different Pis. You'll also need your TSL2591 Light Sensor, your Pi Cobbler, and a few breadboard wires.</p>

<p>In this project, we'll use an <kbd>npm</kbd> module that allows us to set up a Raspberry Pi broker on a Pi—if you have one Pi, we'll have it talk to itself as if it's two separate devices, and if you have a second Pi, we'll have them talk to each other.</p>

<p>If you are only using your original Pi, skip this section.</p>
<p>Use the instructions in <a href="bab2feb9-9667-4f8b-bb2e-1702009b87b4.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Setting Up Your Development Environment</em>, to set up your second Pi. You do not need a cobbler or any other accessories for this project; if you use a second Pi, you just need a good power source and a microSD card set up as stated in <a href="bab2feb9-9667-4f8b-bb2e-1702009b87b4.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Setting Up Your Development Environment</em>.</p>
<p>If you are using two Pis, the Pi without the cobbler is the broker Pi, and your original Pi with the cobbler is the client Pi.</p>
<p>If you are using two Pis, you will want to set the hostname of the broker Pi so that they don't collide. To do this, run the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>sudo raspi-config</strong></pre>
<p>Then select <span class="packt_screen">Network Options</span>, followed by <span class="packt_screen">Hostname</span> with the arrow keys. Set the hostname to something you'll remember (I used <kbd>nodebotanist-pi-broker.local</kbd>). Then, save and exit <kbd>raspi-config</kbd> and reboot the Pi.</p>
<p>When you want to start a session on the broker Pi, you'll now use your custom hostname; for example, if I want to SSH into my broker Pi, I run the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>ssh pi@nodebotanist-pi-broker.local</strong></pre>

<p>You'll want to create two separate project folders for this project: <kbd>client</kbd> and <kbd>broker.</kbd> Create these folders and run the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>npm init -y</strong></pre>
<p>In the <kbd>client</kbd> folder, run the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>npm i --save mqtt dotenv</strong></pre>
<p>In the <kbd>broker</kbd> folder, run the following command:</p>

<p>If you are using two Pis, carry out this entire section on the broker Pi. If you are using one Pi, do all of this on your one Pi.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>We're going to use the Mosca library to set up an MQTT broker on our Pi. The <kbd>mosca npm</kbd> library makes it really easy to set up and start an MQTT broker. All we need is a running mongoDB instance (which we took care of in the last step, <em>Setting up light sensor</em>). </p>
<p>In the <kbd>broker</kbd> folder (either on your original or broker Pi), in the <kbd>index.js</kbd> file, we're going to set up <kbd>mosca</kbd>:</p>
<pre>const mosca = require('mosca')<br/><br/>const mqttBroker = new mosca.Server({<br/>  port: 1883,<br/>  backend: {<br/>    type: 'mongo',<br/>    url: 'mongodb://localhost:27017/mqtt',<br/>    pubsubCollection: 'MQTT-broker-NodeBots',<br/>    mongo: {}<br/>  }<br/>})<br/><br/>server.on('ready', () =&gt; {<br/>  console.log('MQTT broker ready!')<br/>})<br/><br/>server.on('clientConnected', (client) =&gt; {<br/>  console.log('Client connected to MQTT broker: ', client.id)<br/>})<br/><br/>server.on('published', (packet, client) =&gt; {<br/>  client = client || {id: 'N/A'} // Catches a weird edge case with mosca<br/>  console.log(`Client: ${client.id}\nTopic: ${packet.topic}\nMessage: ${packet.payload.toString()}\n`)<br/>})</pre>
<p>We now have our MQTT broker ready to go! Time to program our client.</p>

<p>In your <kbd>client</kbd> folder (and your client Pi if you're using two Pis), open up the <kbd>index.js</kbd> file and write a script to gather light sensor data every time it changes with a threshold of <kbd>10</kbd> (to prevent too many MQTT messages):</p>

<p>Then, before the <kbd>board.on('ready')</kbd> handler, construct your MQTT client connection, and add an <kbd>mqttClient.on()</kbd> handler that subscribes to the <kbd>light</kbd> topic:</p>
<pre>const mqttClient = mqtt.connect(<br/>  process.env.MQTT_BROKER_URL,<br/>  {<br/>    port: process.env.MQTT_BROKER_PORT<br/>  }<br/>)<br/><br/>mqttClient.on('connect', () =&gt; {<br/>  mqttClient.subscribe('light')<br/>})</pre>
<p>Then, inside the <kbd>board.on('ready')</kbd> handler, we'll add the code that publishes light data to our MQTT broker.</p>
<pre>light.on('change', function() {<br/>  mqttClient.publish('light', this.value)<br/>})</pre>
<p>Now that we've coded our client, we need to set environment variables and get it running.</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi we used in this book is just one of over 40 boards supported by Johnny-Five. Just a peek at the platform support page of the Johnny-Five website makes this clear:</p>

<p>The best news is that <em>the code you've written in this book can be transferred to most of the boards pictured here.</em> There are only two steps to porting your code: changing the pin numbers and making sure the board you are switching to offers the functionality you need.</p>

<p>Changing pin numbers means you need to know what pins on your new board complete which tasks. For instance, if you were moving your I2C LCD from the Pi to the Arduino Uno, you'd need to know where the SDA and SCL pins are located on the Uno.</p>
<p>The best way to get this information is to search the internet for [board name] pinout, and searching for an image such as the following for the Uno:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-683 image-border" src="assets/17e4fc81-e082-474f-9d77-1ccdcaf7d730.png" style="width:93.50em;height:67.08em;"/></p>

<p>Some boards support protocols and peripherals that others do not: the Arduino Uno has analog-in pins while the Pi does not, but the Pi has USB support while the Uno does not. Luckily, the Johnny-Five documentation, under <em>Platform Support</em>, tells you what is and isn't supported. The Uno is shown here as an example:</p>

<p>Now that you've got a glimpse at where you can continue your adventure within Johnny-Five, let's take a look at the even larger NodeBots world outside.</p>

<p>There's a wide world of NodeBots out there, and this list is by no means exhaustive. But let's take our first step into that wider world.</p>

<p>The Tessel project sought to create a Node.js native robotics project at a relatively low cost but with a great user experience, and they really have done a great job (disclaimer: I'm on the Tessel project team as a contributing member). In hardware terms, it's much like a Raspberry Pi—it runs Node.js on top of Linux; but not only is it a different form of Linux, the <kbd>tessel-cli</kbd> abstracts away much of the <kbd>ssh-ing</kbd> and Linux commands that we had to do for the Pi. The Tessel 2 is the current model, and it supports Johnny-Five right out of the box. To learn more, visit the Tessel project website at <a href="https://tessel.io/">https://tessel.io/</a>.</p>

<p>There are also bots outside the Johnny-Five ecosystem that run versions of JavaScript instead of full Node.js. One very popular set is the Espruino project boards. There's the Espruino main board, Espruino Wi-Fi, the Espruino Pico, Puck.js, Pixl.js, and an MDBT42Q breakout available at the time of writing. The Espruino project is headed up by Gordon Williams, you can find the boards at <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/?q=Espruino">https://www.adafruit.com/?q=Espruino</a>, while further information is available at <a href="http://www.espruino.com/">http://www.espruino.com/</a>.</p>

<p>The Espruino family holds a dear place in my heart, as it powered one of my first ever NodeBots, a light-up dress:</p>

<p>Node-RED is a project that allows you to graphically program using blocks and write blocks using Node.js. Its graphical interface makes many tasks easier to grasp for younger soon-to-be programmers:</p>

<p>I tend to keep a note file open on my phone of cool things I'd like to have. Then, I go through that list and think: <em>can I build this?</em> I make sure not to consider whether I can buy it straight-up right away—sometimes it's more fun to build the thing you want instead of just buying it, and about 90% of the time, you end up being able to build a project that suits you instead of making do with a store-bought item that doesn't quite do everything you need.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Here's a small selection of books that help teach electronics and related skills to those of you who aren't electrical engineers; I find them super helpful for when I have a hardware problem on my projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The Adafruit Guide to Excellent Soldering</em> (<a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering/tools">https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering/tools</a>). If you don't know how to solder, or you've just been winging it, give this a read to make sure your soldering isn't what's stopping your project from working.</li>
<li><em>Practical Guide to Electronics for Inventors, Fourth Edition</em>, by Paul Scherz. This is a thick book and a dense read, but is a great reference work if you want to learn how electronic components work without doing differential equations.</li>
<li><em>Getting Started in Electronics</em>, by Forrest M Mims III. Do you need something a bit lighter than the Practical Guide? This book is a seminal work in hobbyist electronics, and this series of project notebooks teaches you how to use components to build fun and educational projects.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this chapter, we completed our NodeBots journey together by learning how to get our NodeBots to talk to each other (or themselves). Then, we delved into the wider world of Johnny-Five and NodeBots. Finally, we looked at good reads to continue your quest for knowledge regarding electronics and related skills.</p>
<p>I love to see what my readers build—please feel free to reach me at <kbd>@nodebotani.st</kbd> or <kbd>@nodebotanist</kbd> on twitter to show me what you have come up with—even if it's a blinking LED and you're just proud to show it, I'm always happy to see it.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for reading. I appreciate my readers and wish you all the best!</p>
