- en: Welcome! JavaScript design patterns are techniques that allow us to write more
    robust, scalable, and extensible applications in JavaScript. JavaScript is the
    main programming language available in web browsers and is one of the most popular
    programming languages with support beyond browsers.

- en: Design patterns are solutions to common problems that can be reused. The most-written-about
    design patterns come from the world of object-oriented programming.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: JavaScript’s attributes as a lightweight, multi-paradigm, dynamic, single-threaded
    language give it different strengths and weaknesses to other mainstream programming
    languages. It’s common for software engineers to use JavaScript in addition to
    being well versed in a different programming language. JavaScript’s different
    gearing means that implementing design patterns verbatim can lead to non-idiomatic
    and under-performing JavaScript applications.

- en: There are many resources on JavaScript and design patterns, but this book provides
    a cohesive and comprehensive view of design patterns in modern (ECMAScript 6+)
    JavaScript with real-world examples of how to deploy them in a professional setting.
    In addition to this complete library of patterns to apply to projects, this book
    also provides an overview of how to structure different parts of an application
    to deliver high performance at scale.

- en: In this book, you will be provided with up-to-date guidance through the world
    of modern JavaScript patterns based on nine years of experience building and deploying
    JavaScript and React applications at scale at companies such as Elsevier, Canon,
    and Eurostar, delivering multiple system evolutions, performance projects, and
    a next-generation frontend application architecture.

  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 1*](B19109_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor018)*, Working with Creational Design
    Patterns,* covers creational design patterns, which help to organize object creation.
    We’ll look at implementing the prototype, singleton, and factory patterns in JavaScript.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 2*](B19109_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor057)*, Implementing Structural Design
    Patterns,* looks at structural design patterns, which help to organize relationships
    between entities. We’ll implement the proxy, decorator, flyweight, and adapter
    patterns in JavaScript.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 3*](B19109_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor095)*, Leveraging Behavioral Design
    Patterns,* delves into behavioral design patterns, which help to organize communication
    between objects. We’ll learn about the observer, state, strategy, and visitor
    patterns in JavaScript.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 4*](B19109_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor130)*, Exploring Reactive View Library
    Patterns,* explores reactive view libraries, such as React, which have taken over
    the JavaScript application landscape. With these libraries come new patterns to
    explore, implement, and contrast.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 5*](B19109_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor173)*, Rendering Strategies and
    Page Hydration,* takes a look at optimizing page performance, which is a key concern
    nowadays. It’s a concern both for improving the on-page conversion of customers
    and search engine optimization, since search engines such as Google take core
    web vitals into account.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 6*](B19109_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor199)*, Micro Frontends, Zones, and
    Islands Architectures,* explores micro frontends. Akin to the microservices movement
    in the service tier, micro frontends are designed to split a large surface area
    into smaller chunks that can be worked on and delivered at higher velocity.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 7*](B19109_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor238)*, Asynchronous Programming
    Performance Patterns,* looks at how JavaScript’s single-threaded event-loop-based
    concurrency model is one of its greatest strengths but is often misunderstood
    or under-leveraged in performance-sensitive situations. Writing asynchronous-handling
    code in JavaScript in a performant and extensible manner is key to delivering
    a smooth user experience at scale.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 8*](B19109_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor250)*, Event-Driven Programming
    Patterns,* explores how event-driven programming in JavaScript is of paramount
    importance in security-sensitive applications as it is a way to pass information
    from and to different web contexts. Event-driven applications can often be optimized
    to enable better performance and scalability.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 9*](B19109_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor261)*, Maximizing Performance –
    Lazy Loading and Code Splitting,* deals with how, in order to maximize the performance
    of a JavaScript application, reducing the amount of unused JavaScript being loaded
    and interpreted is key. The techniques that can be brought to bear on this problem
    are called lazy loading and code splitting.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[*Chapter 10*](B19109_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor272)*, Asset-Loading Strategies
    and Executing Code off the Main Thread,* looks at howthere are situations in the
    lifecycle of an application where loading more JavaScript or assets is inevitable.
    You will learn about asset-loading optimizations in the specific case of JavaScript,
    as well as other web resources, and finally how to execute JavaScript off the
    main browser thread.'
