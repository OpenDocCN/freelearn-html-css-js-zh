<em>A large number of websites and web applications are located on a remote web server, somewhere in a computer center or some similar platform far away. This is sometimes a bit problematic because while developing a website or a web application on a remote server, you have to upload every changed file manually. In such a cases the working process is very long, programming some changes in your code, switching to the third-party FTP software, trying to remember which files you have just edited, selecting them, and then finally uploading them can be very annoying. When these files are uploaded you will be able to test the results of the changes in your developing project. Thus, there are many steps for every small change in your website or web application.</em>
</p><p>
<em>But there is a much easier way with Aptana Studio for developing a project on a remote web server. Aptana Studio allows you to work in a remote way with your project. This is much easier than to work with the third-party FTP software. You do not have to remember which files you have changed, you just have to make changes in your file and save it, that's it! Aptana Studio realizes that you have changed a file and uses the sync functionality to upload your changes. All of this happens automatically.</em>

<em>Let's try it out!</em>
</p><p>In this chapter we will cover:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Using the Remote view for creating, modifying, and deleting FTP connections</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Using the Web Deployment Wizard</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Using the <strong>Connection Manager</strong> window for creating, modifying, and deleting connections</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Exporting and importing FTP settings</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec105"/>The Remote view</h1></div></div></div><p>The first thing we need to take a look at is the <a id="id466" class="indexterm"/>Remote view. The Remote view is for managing the FTP connections and it therefore provides a complete list of all currently available FTP connections. We will see how you can open this view, how you will be able to create new FTP connections, and modify and delete the existing connections.</p><p>In order to open the Remote view, just navigate to <strong>Window</strong> | <strong>Show view...</strong> and select the <strong>Remote</strong> entry. Now, the <strong>Remote</strong> view should appear on the left of Aptana Studio, grouped besides the <a id="id467" class="indexterm"/>
<strong>Project Explorer</strong> and the <a id="id468" class="indexterm"/>
<strong>App Explorer</strong> views, as seen in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/8246_08_01.jpg" alt="The Remote view"/></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec106"/>Time for action – creating an FTP connection</h1></div></div></div><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Open the Remote view.</li><li class="listitem">Click on the small world icon located in the upper-right <a id="id469" class="indexterm"/>corner of the <a id="id470" class="indexterm"/>Remote view.</li><li class="listitem">First enter a name for the new FTP connection. Ideally choose a name that contains the IP or the Hostname.</li><li class="listitem">Then you have to select the protocol that should be used for the connection. Just select FTP, SFTP, or FTPS. We will choose FTP for our example.</li><li class="listitem">Further, you must enter the Host, Username, and Password for the connection.</li><li class="listitem">After you have entered the account data, you can use the <strong>Test</strong> button in order to test the entered access data immediately.</li><li class="listitem">Additionally, if the Connection Test was successful, you can choose a remote directory that should be used as the default directory for its new connections.<div><img src="img/8246_08_02.jpg" alt="Time for action – creating an FTP connection"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Finally, you can expand the <strong>More Options</strong> section in <a id="id471" class="indexterm"/><a id="id472" class="indexterm"/>order to make more detailed settings, such as choosing a different <strong>Port</strong> or <strong>Encoding</strong> option, as seen in the following screenshot:<div><img src="img/8246_08_03.jpg" alt="Time for action – creating an FTP connection"/></div></li><li class="listitem">After saving the new FTP connection by clicking on <strong>OK</strong>, the new connection appears in the Remote view connection list, as seen in the following screenshot:<div><img src="img/8246_08_04.jpg" alt="Time for action – creating an FTP connection"/></div></li></ol></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec116"/>
<em>What just happened?</em>
</h2></div></div></div><p>We have created a single new FTP connection by using the Remote view. Now we are able to use this FTP connection within the <strong>Connection Manager</strong> window, or directly from a project in order to connect them with a remote server.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec107"/>Time for action – modifying an FTP connection</h1></div></div></div><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Open the Remote view.</li><li class="listitem">Select the FTP connection within the <a id="id473" class="indexterm"/>connection list that you want to <a id="id474" class="indexterm"/>modify.</li><li class="listitem"> Right-click on it and select the <strong>Properties</strong> entry.</li><li class="listitem">Now, a window appears wherein you can modify the connection data.</li><li class="listitem">Finally, confirm the changes by clicking on <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol></div><p>The following dialog box will appear where we can edit our connection settings:</p><div><img src="img/8246_08_05.jpg" alt="Time for action – modifying an FTP connection"/></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec117"/>
<em>What just happened?</em>
</h2></div></div></div><p>We have modified an existing FTP connection (a connection that may have a new password) and confirmed the new connection data. From now on, the connection uses the current modified account data.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec118"/>Deleting an FTP connection</h2></div></div></div><p>An FTP connection can be deleted very quickly. Just open the <a id="id475" class="indexterm"/>Remote view and select the <a id="id476" class="indexterm"/>FTP connection within the connection list that you want to delete. Now right-click on this entry and select the <strong>Delete</strong> entry.</p><p>Aptana Studio asks you if you're sure you want to delete this connection. If you are sure, just confirm the deletion by clicking on <strong>OK</strong>. The following screenshot shows how we can delete an FTP connection:</p><div><img src="img/8246_08_06.jpg" alt="Deleting an FTP connection"/></div><p>From now on, this deleted connection isn't available anymore within Aptana Studio.</p><p>As you are now familiar with managing FTP connections using the Remote view, we will go ahead and take a look at how we can connect these FTP connections with local projects or local directories. For this, we will use the <strong>Web Deployment Wizard</strong>.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec119"/>Using the Web Deployment Wizard</h2></div></div></div><p>The <strong>Web Deployment Wizard</strong> helps you to <a id="id477" class="indexterm"/>connect to a local project with a remote server using an FTP connection. Let's see how easy it is in the next few steps.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec108"/>Time for action – connecting a project with a remote server</h1></div></div></div><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">At first, we create a small project that we want to <a id="id478" class="indexterm"/><a id="id479" class="indexterm"/>use for our example. We do it as usual and afterwards you can select the project root within the Project Explorer or open it within the App Explorer. In this example, we open the project within the App Explorer.</li><li class="listitem">Now we have to start the Web Development Wizard. This wizard is located behind the package symbol at the top of the App Explorer (the Project Explorer has this symbol in the same place). We <a id="id480" class="indexterm"/>can open this wizard just by clicking on the package symbol and selecting the <strong>Run Web Development Wizard...</strong> entry as shown in the following screenshot:<div><img src="img/8246_08_07.jpg" alt="Time for action – connecting a project with a remote server"/></div></li><li class="listitem">In the first step of the Web Development Wizard, you have to select a deployment provider. Because we want to connect our project with FTP, we select the <a id="id481" class="indexterm"/><strong>FTP/SFTP/FTPS</strong> option for our example, as seen in the following screenshot:<div><img src="img/8246_08_08.jpg" alt="Time for action – connecting a project with a remote server"/></div></li><li class="listitem">After that, you have to enter your FTP connection data. The first step thereby is to enter a name for your connection. This name should be related to the website or the web application so that you are able to identify the connection easily.</li><li class="listitem">The selection of the protocol is an important step. Depending on this selection, the further number and types of fields will be changed automatically. The possible options are FTP, SFTP, and FTPS. Just select the required protocol. We want to set up a simple FTP account, therefore we select just FTP.</li><li class="listitem">In this step we enter the server host, Username, and Password for the FTP connection. After you have entered this data, you will be able to use another nice Aptana Studio feature – a connection <a id="id482" class="indexterm"/><strong>Test</strong> button. Click on this button and Aptana Studio tries to connect to the web server <a id="id483" class="indexterm"/><a id="id484" class="indexterm"/>that you have just specified. In case Aptana Studio is able to connect to the web server, you will get an appropriate message; if not, you receive an error message from the internal FTP client. A success message is seen in the following screenshot:<div><img src="img/8246_08_09.jpg" alt="Time for action – connecting a project with a remote server"/></div></li><li class="listitem">If you have entered the correct connection data and the connection test was successful, you will now be able to select a directory on the remote web server that is used as the root directory for your source code, as shown in the following screenshot:<div><img src="img/8246_08_10.jpg" alt="Time for action – connecting a project with a remote server"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Further, there's a <strong>More Options</strong> sections where you can adjust some more special actions, such as the used Port or Encoding.</li><li class="listitem">The final configuration within this window is the sync setting. This option is available at this stage if you're creating an FTP connection related to a project. Here you can set the behavior of the <a id="id485" class="indexterm"/><a id="id486" class="indexterm"/>synchronization. Once you have activated the synchronization, you get the settings seen in the following screenshot:<p>These sync settings are shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/8246_08_11.jpg" alt="Time for action – connecting a project with a remote server"/></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip48"/>Tip</h3><p>
<strong>Why is the sync setting so important?</strong>
</p><a id="id487" class="indexterm"/><p>The sync setting is very important. What if you are working with different developers on the same remote project and some developer changed a file that you have already downloaded as a local copy? No problem, you don't need to think about it, Aptana Studio uses the sync function in order to identify differences.</p></div></div></li><li class="listitem">By finishing the Web Deployment Wizard, Aptana Studio automatically starts the first synchronization. Here you have to <a id="id488" class="indexterm"/><a id="id489" class="indexterm"/>initially select which files should be synchronized. The following screenshot shows the synchronization window:<div><img src="img/8246_08_12.jpg" alt="Time for action – connecting a project with a remote server"/></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip49"/>Tip</h3><p>
<strong>Skip the .project file</strong>
</p><p>Before you start the synchronization, check the <strong>Skip</strong> checkbox from the <code class="literal">.project</code> file, because you just need this file in your local Aptana Studio project.</p></div></div></li><li class="listitem">A click on the <a id="id490" class="indexterm"/><strong>Synchronize</strong> button starts the <a id="id491" class="indexterm"/><a id="id492" class="indexterm"/>synchronization. After it is done, your remote project contains the current source code, and you can close the synchronization window.</li></ol></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec120"/>
<em>What just happened?</em>
</h2></div></div></div><p>We have created a PHP project and connected it with a remote web server. After that, we synchronized it with one another.</p><p>We are now able to work with the remote files within our local project. If you now modify a file and then save it, Aptana Studio automatically starts the synchronization and uploads the modified file.</p><p>You will also be able to start the synchronization manually, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/8246_08_13.jpg" alt="What just happened?"/></div><p>Take a quick look at the <strong>Publish</strong> menu within the <strong>App Explorer</strong> view too.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec121"/>Using the Connection Manager</h2></div></div></div><p>The <strong>Connection Manager</strong> <a id="id493" class="indexterm"/>window allows you to configure connections between a local container and a remote site or another local container.</p><p>The difference between the remote view and the <strong>Connection Manager</strong> window is that you're defining just the FTP connections in the remote view, whereas in the <strong>Connection Manager</strong> window you're managing the combination of an FTP connection and some local projects or directories.</p><p>So, you're able to create a single FTP connection to a web server and use this within many different connections and local projects or directories.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec109"/>Time for action – opening the Connection Manager and creating a new connection</h1></div></div></div><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to the Project <a id="id494" class="indexterm"/>Explorer.</li><li class="listitem">Select a Project and expand it.</li><li class="listitem">You should see the <strong>Connections</strong> node as the last node in the project, as shown in the following screenshot:<div><img src="img/8246_08_14.jpg" alt="Time for action – opening the Connection Manager and creating a new connection"/></div></li><li class="listitem">But what to do if you didn't see this <strong>Connection</strong> node? No problem, in this case the connection node is just invisible. In order to activate the connection node, click on the <strong>View</strong> menu and select the <strong>Customize View...</strong> entry. Within the <strong>Available Customizations</strong> window, you have to switch to the <strong>Content</strong> tab and activate the <strong>Site Connections</strong> check box as seen in the following screenshot:<div><img src="img/8246_08_15.jpg" alt="Time for action – opening the Connection Manager and creating a new connection"/></div></li><li class="listitem">If you see the <strong>Connections</strong> section within your project, right-click on it and select the <a id="id495" class="indexterm"/><strong>Connection Manager...</strong> entry, as seen in <a id="id496" class="indexterm"/>the following screenshot:<div><img src="img/8246_08_16.jpg" alt="Time for action – opening the Connection Manager and creating a new connection"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Now in order to create a new connection, we're clicking on the green plus symbol (<strong>+</strong>) at the bottom of the left-hand side, below the list. The <strong>Connection Manager</strong> window creates a new entry within the <strong>Connections</strong> list and selects them automatically, so that we can enter the connection data immediately.</li><li class="listitem">You have to enter an appropriate name for the new connection in the <strong>Name</strong> text field located at the top of the view.</li><li class="listitem">In the next step you have to select a local source. This could be an already existing Aptana Studio project, or also a directory on your local drive. You will be able to select it with the <a id="id497" class="indexterm"/><strong>Browse...</strong> button. Go on and select your source.</li><li class="listitem">Finally you have to select the destination for the <a id="id498" class="indexterm"/>connection.

<em>What just happened?</em>
</h2></div></div></div><p>In the first step, we just opened the <strong>Connection Manager</strong> window. In some cases the <strong>Connection Manager</strong> node is invisible, so we must take a look at how we can make it visible. Anyway, you must have seen the <strong>Connection Manager</strong> node on your screen.</p><p>After that, we created a new connection within the <strong>Connection Manager</strong> window. This means we have connected a local project with some other project, which may also be located on a remote system as seen in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/8246_08_17.jpg" alt="What just happened?"/></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec123"/>Modifying an existing connection within the Connection Manager</h2></div></div></div><p>First of all, open the <strong>Connection Manager</strong> window if it is not <a id="id499" class="indexterm"/>already opened. Select the connection you want to modify within the connection list. By selecting the connection, <strong>Connection Manager</strong> fills in the connection data into the right form fields. Now you're able to change their values and apply the changes by clicking on the <strong>Apply</strong> button.</p><p>Now, we have just selected an existing connection within the <strong>Connection Manager</strong> window and modified the values of the connection. After we adjusted the values, we saved them by clicking on the <a id="id500" class="indexterm"/>
<strong>Apply</strong> button.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec124"/>Deleting an existing connection within the Connection Manager</h2></div></div></div><p>First of all, open the <strong>Connection Manager</strong> window if <a id="id501" class="indexterm"/>not already opened. Select the connection that you want to delete within the connection list. Now click on the red symbol located at the end of the connection list. After that, Aptana Studio asks you if you're sure you want to delete this connection. If you are, just click on <strong>OK</strong> to finish the deletion.</p><p>Now, we have just deleted an existing connection from the <strong>Connection Manager</strong> window. This connection will now no longer be available in Aptana Studio.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl2sec125"/>Exporting and importing FTP settings</h2></div></div></div><p>Aptana Studio allows you to export your created connections and import them again in the future. This is a very useful feature. You may create a backup from your connections and restore them if you're setting up a new installation of Aptana Studio. But it's also useful for companies or development teams that have a recurring amount of connections. They can create this current connections in only one Aptana Studio installation and export them into an export file. After that, they will be able to import these connections easily in all the other Aptana Studio installations.</p></div></div>

This means you know how you can create, modify, and delete connections. Additionally, you should know in detail how you can connect a project with a remote web server and how you can configure the automatic synchronization. We have also seen how the FTP connection in Aptana Studio works fine with our small project; but if you're developing larger projects where a complete developer team is working, it's a better use case to work with a version control, such as SVN or Git.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will learn how we can work with a SVN repositiory and a Git repository.</p></div></body></html>
