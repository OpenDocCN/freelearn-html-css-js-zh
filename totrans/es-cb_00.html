<p class="mce-root">JavaScript permeates the development landscape like few languages before it. Since the introduction of the Node.js run-time in May of 2009, it has ventured far beyond the browser. It now works with controllers on a Raspberry Pi, as the scripting language for 3D video games that run on desktop computers, running web servers that serve millions of page views a day, and, of course, it is the dominant language for web browsers. It is possible that JavaScript is the most important programming language in the world.</p>
<p>The ECMAScript standard has been around almost as long as JavaScript. However, in the last few years, it has seen a flurry of activity. ES6, published in 2015, created an almost completely new language. Since then, the updates have been more gradual, but still significant. This book covers the standard up to ES8 (released in 2017). We'll discuss how to use some of its new features to organize programs more effectively and write better code.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Who this book is for</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This book is intended for a broad array of readers. While this should not be considered an introductory text, anyone who has written a JavaScript program and has run it in a browser will be sufficiently prepared to read this book. JavaScript experts will also find some good food for thought. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">What this book covers</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p><a href="85357458-c80c-4ebf-8ada-ce99243c496e.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Building with Modules</em>, covers how to use ECMAScript modules to organize code and how to configure modern browsers to use them. This chapter also covers compatibility with Google's Chrome and Mozilla's Firefox browser, and how to make them work with modules.<br/></p>
<p><a href="dc9427bb-11e5-40a6-bb49-dc0d507df818.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Staying Compatible with Legacy Browsers</em>, covers how to convert code that uses ECMAScript modules into a format that can be used by platforms that don't support them. We use webpack, a common JavaScript compilation tool, to assemble our modules into a single JavaScript file (called a bundle) and load it into our browser when ECMASript modules aren't compatible.</p>
<p> <a href="f12a4d4c-4aed-430a-a33a-b8a7cd55c55d.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Working with Promises</em>, covers how to use the Promise API to organize asynchronous programs. We'll take a look at how to propagate results through promise chains and handle errors. Promises are generally regarded as an improvement over the older callback pattern. This chapter also lays a foundation for the topic covered in the next chapter.<br/></p>
<p><a href="ff3732d6-20ed-4998-a1fc-c2c0aa2a0ee0.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Working with async/await and Functions</em>, covers how to use the new <kbd>async</kbd> and <kbd>await</kbd> features. Building on the preceding chapter, we'll take a look at how they can be replaced or used in concert with the Promise API, improving program readability while maintaining compatibility.<br/></p>
<p><a href="893e5fe4-d01a-419c-99ff-921ae27c1299.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Web Workers, Shared Memory, and Atomics</em>, covers the web APIs that can be used to process data in parallel. This chapter is emblematic for the recent development of JavaScript as a language and web browsers as platforms. Parallel programming is a new domain for JavaScript that brings new possibilities and problems to the language.<br/></p>
<p><a href="0ff0c6a3-a324-4346-8ba5-37275e85aa1b.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Plain Objects</em>, demonstrates the use of API and syntax options to work with plain objects. We'll look at how to work with objects as a collection and how to define properties with some interesting behaviors.<br/></p>
<p><a href="7d33c117-bad7-49b9-b510-c9f01225377d.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Creating Classes</em>, covers the use of ECMAScript class semantics. We'll create new classes with behaviors that are defined on single instances and whole classes. We'll take a look at how to add properties and define methods.<br/></p>
<p><a href="27bedd69-df1f-4438-821c-5f7bbf4d25ca.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Inheritance and Composition</em>, builds on our knowledge from the preceding chapter; we'll combine classes into larger structures. We'll also take a look at how to use both composition and inheritance to share behaviors between classes, and we'll discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each.<br/></p>
<p><a href="51f27ab6-d213-4aa4-ab6f-770a768ab734.xhtml">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Larger Structures with Design Patterns,</em> further expanding on the prior two chapters, looks at some common ways that programs are organized for certain tasks. We'll implement some common design patterns and demonstrate how we can expand and modify them for different uses.<br/></p>
<p><a href="3d708885-0b1a-4b87-8969-d19022808a8c.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Working with Arrays</em>, covers the use of the new <kbd>Array</kbd> API features. In the past, working with arrays meant a lot of loops and keeping track of indices, or importing bulky libraries to clean repeated code. This chapter will show some new, functionally inspired, methods that make working with these collections much easier.</p>
<p> <a href="f2c19311-ab2a-4cf3-bd05-64cad3b471b3.xhtml">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Working with Maps and Symbols</em>, covers how to make use of the  <kbd>Map</kbd> and <kbd>WeakMap</kbd> classes to create relationships between different kinds of values. In this chapter, we'll look at how to use the APIs of these two classes, how they are different, and how we can control which types go into them.<br/></p>
<p><a href="f9060ab4-ea74-4200-b8c8-b47453f7e179.xhtml">Chapter 12</a>, <em>Working with Sets</em>, demonstrates the use of the <kbd>Set</kbd> and <kbd>WeakSet</kbd> classes. These classes are excellent when the order of elements doesn't matter, and we just want to is something exists. We'll see how to use the APIs of these two classes, when to use one over the other, and how we can control what types go into them.<br/></p>

<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: Indicates code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. Here is an example: "Next, in the same directory, create a file called <kbd>hello.js</kbd>, which exports a function named <kbd>sayHi</kbd>, which writes a message to the console."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">// hello.js 
export function sayHi () { 
  console.log('Hello, World'); 
} </pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">import rocketName, { launch, COUNT_DOWN_DURATION } from './saturn-v.js'; 
<strong>import falconName, { launch as falconLaunch, COUNT_DOWN_DURATION as falconCount } from './falcon-heavy.js';</strong> </pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>cd ~/Desktop/es8-cookbook-workspace</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Double-click <strong>nvm-setup</strong>."</p>
<p>Warnings or important notes appear like this.</p>
<p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p>
