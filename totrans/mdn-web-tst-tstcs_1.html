			<h1 id="_idParaDest-13"><a id="_idTextAnchor013"/><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em>: Why TestCafe?</h1>
			<p><a id="_idTextAnchor014"/>TestCafe—a new promising software testing framework or just a place where you can eat? Here, we will take a look at what TestCafe is and what its main features are. What is the technology? What do you need to know? How does it integrate with other tools? In this book, we will see what TestCafe is used for, go through its main features, and compare it with a well-known industry standard—Selenium.</p>
			<p>More practically, we will develop a set of tests for a bug tracking system. <a id="_idTextAnchor015"/>You will learn how to write end-to-end tests using the TestCafe syntax and the features of the TestCafe framework. You'll go from setting up the environment all the way down to writing production-ready tests.</p>
			<p>Throughout this book, we'll build a sample set of tests step by step that will log in to a website, verify the elements present on different pages, create/delete entities, and execute custom JavaScript code using TestCafe. Additionally, there will be several stages of refactoring to showcase setup/teardown and PageObjects.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Please keep in mind that this book does not pretend to be the only source of truth - its main goal is to demonstrate some original approaches, not to enforce the strict rules. Feel free to use and extend all the techniques explored in this book.</p>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, we will have a clear idea of TestCafe and what lies ahead—a plan of features that will be tested. We will also review the demo website and come up with a set of test cases that will be automated in the upcoming chapters.<a id="_idTextAnchor016"/></p>
			<p>To sum up the contents of this chapter, the following main topics will be covered:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introducing TestCafe.</li>
				<li>Exploring the main features of TestCafe.</li>
				<li>Comparing TestCafe and Selenium.</li>
				<li>Reviewing the test project we will build.</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-14"><a id="_idTextAnchor017"/>Introducing TestCafe</h1>
			<p><a id="_idTextAnchor018"/>If you <a id="_idIndexMarker000"/>work for a huge enterprise company or a small but innovative start-up and your automated tests need to support customers with older browsers the same as the new ones, you should definitely try TestCafe. Just like Selenium, it's open source, but you don't have to install any other packages or additional web drivers. TestCafe is a self-sufficient, free, end-to-end testing framework that combines unmatched ease of use with advanced automation and robust built-in stability mechanisms.</p>
			<p>It was created<a id="_idIndexMarker001"/> by DevExpress (https://github.com/DevExpress) and was open sourced under the MIT license. TestCafe can take care of all stages of the automated testing process:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Launching applications before tests.</li>
				<li>Launching different browsers.</li>
				<li>Running tests.</li>
				<li>Taking screenshots.</li>
				<li>Outputting test results.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>TestCafe does not require any additional installation of browser plugins and works in all major modern browsers right out of the box. It is gaining popularity as a faster and easier-to-use solution compared to Selenium.</p>
			<p>Now that we've had a quick glimpse of what TestCafe is, let's continue with an overview of its main features.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-15"><a id="_idTextAnchor019"/>Exploring the main features of TestCafe</h1>
			<p>Now, let's take a more <a id="_idIndexMarker002"/>detailed look at all the bells and whistles that TestCafe has to offer:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Pretty much all TestCafe needs to run is a browser and Node.js configured on your machine, so there is <strong class="bold">minimal setup</strong>.</li>
				<li>TestCafe can run tests in <strong class="bold">headless mode</strong> (on Chrome or Firefox) without a need to render a <strong class="bold">Document Object Model (DOM)</strong>. This <a id="_idIndexMarker003"/>feature is extremely <a id="_idIndexMarker004"/>useful when running tests on any <strong class="bold">Continuous Integration (CI) </strong>system.</li>
				<li>TestCafe <strong class="bold">supports all main operating systems</strong>, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.</li>
				<li>The officially <a id="_idIndexMarker005"/>supported browsers of TestCafe are Google Chrome (Stable, Beta, Dev, and Canary), Internet Explorer (11+), Microsoft Edge (Legacy and Chromium-based), Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome mobile, and Safari mobile – so it is <strong class="bold">cross-browser</strong>. You can find a full list of supported browsers and their aliases at <a href="https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/documentation/guides/concepts/browsers.html#officially-supported-browsers">https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/documentation/guides/concepts/browsers.html#officially-supported-browsers</a>.</li>
				<li>Tests can be written in the latest <strong class="bold">JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, </strong>or<strong class="bold"> CoffeeScript</strong> formats (we will be using JavaScript to demonstrate this in the upcoming chapters).</li>
				<li>Clear and flexible API with support of the <strong class="bold">PageModel pattern</strong> (we will see how this works in <a href="B16280_06_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor132"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Refactoring with PageObjects</em>).</li>
				<li>Stable tests due to the <strong class="bold">smart assertion and automatic waiting mechanisms</strong> (this will be discuss<a id="_idTextAnchor020"/>ed in <a href="B16280_02_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor027"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Exploring TestCafe Under the Hood</em>).</li>
				<li>TestCafe has a lot of <strong class="bold">free custom plugins</strong>: cloud browser providers and emulators (SauceLabs, BrowserStack, CrossBrowserTesting, and so on), framework-specific selectors to interact with page elements in a way that is native to your framework (React, Angular, Vue, and Aurelia), custom reporters to get test results in different formats (TeamCity, Slack, NUnit, and TimeCafe), IDE plugins to run tests and view results from your favorite IDE (Visual Studio Code, Webstorm, and SublimeText), Cucumber support to create and run tests with Cucumber syntax, and much more, as TestCafe developers and community members are extremely active. All of these are ready to use and open source (https://github.com/DevExpress/testcafe#plugins).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are the main<a id="_idIndexMarker006"/> features of the TestCafe open source framework. Wondering if there are any products on top of that that don't require you to write code? Sure thing!</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-16"><a id="_idTextAnchor021"/>Introducing TestCafe Studio</h2>
			<p>In addition to the open source TestCafe framework, there is a paid test recording tool called TestCafe Studio. It is <a id="_idIndexMarker007"/>built on top of the TestCafe engine to give test engineers the opportunity to record, run, and update tests without any special knowledge of JavaScript. It is achieved by transforming user actions from recording into repeatable code.</p>
			<p>As well as complementing the features provided by the TestCafe framework, TestCafe Studio takes things even further with the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Visual test recorder</strong>: This allows <a id="_idIndexMarker008"/>you to create tests without writing any code. It records your interactions with the web page in the browser and generates corresponding tests (https://docs.devexpress.com/TestCafeStudio/400165/guides/record-tests).</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Interactive test editor</strong>: Allows <a id="_idIndexMarker009"/>you to view and edit tests and hooks in a comprehensive, visualized manner (https://docs.devexpress.com/TestCafeStudio/400190/user-interface/test-editor).</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Automatic selector generation</strong>: TestCafe Studio can generate element selectors while recording <a id="_idIndexMarker010"/>when you interact with a web page or when a web page element is picked with the element picker (https://docs.devexpress.com/TestCafeStudio/400407/test-actions/element-selectors#auto-generated-element-selectors).</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Run configuration manager</strong>: Allows <a id="_idIndexMarker011"/>you to create, modify, and delete run configurations for desktop, headless, and mobile browsers (https://docs.devexpress.com/TestCafeStudio/400189/user-interface/run-configurations-dialog).</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Code editor</strong>: Allows <a id="_idIndexMarker012"/>you to write and modify test scripts (https://docs.devexpress.com/TestCafeStudio/400181/user-interface/code-editor).<p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">TestCafe Studio<a id="_idIndexMarker013"/> has 30-day free trial period – you can find more information about this at <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/products/testcafestudio/qa-end-to-end-web-testing.xml">https://www.devexpress.com/products/testcafestudio/qa-end-to-end-web-testing.xml</a>.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's stop for a moment, catch our breath, and review what we have learned so far. We have acquired a basic understanding of what TestCafe is and have gone through a list of what it has to offer – the main features, plugins, and the TestCafe Studio test recording tool. Now, let's proceed with an overview of how TestCafe competes with Selenium.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-17">Comparing TestCafe<a id="_idTextAnchor022"/> and Selenium</h1>
			<p>TestCafe, with its 8,000+ stars<a id="_idIndexMarker014"/> on GitHub, is gaining a reputation as the 'next big thing' in <a id="_idIndexMarker015"/>the test automation world. Let's compare this new challenger with Selenium – a heavyweight leader with almost 18k+ stars that has ruled the industry for more than 15 years.</p>
			<p>To start automating with Selenium, you will have to install the WebDriver client for the desired programming language and corresponding drivers for each browser you want your tests to run at. This may sound like an easy thing to do, but it's quite a time-consuming task to just get started with testing and is far from the ideal scenario of the run-one-command simplicity that we're used to with the majority of the packages in the Node.js infrastructure.</p>
			<p>TestCafe includes a number of features that would not be possible if TestCafe was built on top of Selenium, such as spawning isolated test environments. Each of the tests performed by TestCafe runs as if it was started in a new incognito tab, so all the cookies and the storage are purged. This helps to reduce test code duplication and gives a significant execution time economy as you don't need to clear the browser state between tests to make them independent of each other.</p>
			<p>This also enables one more<a id="_idIndexMarker016"/> extremely useful feature – user roles, that lets you save the state of different logged-in users and switch between them any time in any test (https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/documentation/guides/advanced-guides/authentication.html).</p>
			<p>Built-in automatic waiting is yet <a id="_idIndexMarker017"/>another killer feature introduced in TestCafe. What it means is that TestCafe will automatically wait for all XHR requests and page loads to be finished before running each test action, so you no longer need to write custom waiters in your code.</p>
			<p>Let's compare TestCafe and Selenium side by side:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer005" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.0 - Table comparing TestCafe and Selenium</p>
			<p>To sum up what we have just learned, Selenium definitely provides an advantage with the number of supported programming languages, but needs a lot of tweaking and extending to work properly. On the other hand, TestCafe only supports JavaScript, TypeScript and CoffeeScript but offers much more comfort and ease of usage right out of the box.</p>
			<p>Let's proceed with our exploration and shed some light on the test project that we will be developing throughout the following chapters.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-18"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>Reviewing the test project we will build</h1>
			<p>As we have got acquainted <a id="_idIndexMarker018"/>with the main features of TestCafe, let's think about the best way we can leverage this testing framework for our practical needs.</p>
			<p>To make a set of tests that are reusable and demonstrate the main concepts of TestCafe, we will need an application that can be tested. It should be accessible online and should have a number of standard features, such as logging in, logging out, creating a new entity, displaying an entity, updating an entity, and deleting an entity.</p>
			<p>The application we will use to do this is Redmine.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-19"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>Selecting a test application</h2>
			<p>All of the previously <a id="_idIndexMarker019"/>mentioned features are present in any bug tracking system. However, one of the few applications that is publicly available and free to <a id="_idIndexMarker020"/>use is Redmine (<a href="http://demo.redmine.org/">http://demo.redmine.org/</a>):</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer006" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_1.01_B16280.jpg" alt="Figure 1.1 – Redmine demo web portal&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.2 – Redmine demo web portal</p>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.1 – Redmine demo web portal</p>
			<p>Redmine is a<a id="_idIndexMarker021"/> web-based<a id="_idIndexMarker022"/> project management and issue-tracking tool released on June 25, 2006 and was written in Ruby on Rails. It is open sourced under <a id="_idIndexMarker023"/>the terms of the <strong class="bold">GNU General Public License (GPL) v2</strong>. Some of the features that Redmine supports include issue management (create, read, update, and delete), version management, document management, news, files, directories, calendars, charts, roadmaps, activity view, and member roles and permission management.</p>
			<p>That's an impressive list, isn't it? Also, it is cross-platform, cross-database, and supports 49 languages. Redmine perfectly combines issue tracking and project management functionality, and can be considered a leading project management solution in the open source world.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-20"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/>Writing test cases</h2>
			<p>As we now have a <a id="_idIndexMarker024"/>web application for testing, let's get familiar with it and write some test cases. We don't have to execute these tests right now, but we will need them when writing automated tests later on in the book.</p>
			<p>Here is what the Redmine login page looks like: </p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer007" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_1.02_B16280.jpg" alt="Figure 1.2 – Redmine login page&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.2 – Redmine login page</p>
			<p>Let's break down the actions <a id="_idIndexMarker025"/>that we'll need to perform for logging in:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Sign in</strong> link.</li>
				<li>Type in the login details for the <strong class="bold">Login</strong> input.</li>
				<li>Type in the password for the <strong class="bold">Password</strong> input.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Login</strong> button.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Here is what we'll see after logging in successfully:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer008" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="image/Figure_1.03_B16280.jpg" alt="Figure 1.3 – The Redmine logged in page"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.4 – The Redmine logged in page</p>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 1.3 – The Redmine logged-in page</p>
			<p>To confirm that you have <a id="_idIndexMarker026"/>logged in properly, check whether the username is displayed in the top-right corner of the page. That's it – our first test case is ready!</p>
			<p>But even before logging in, we will need to create a new test user. We will be doing this for each new test run – that's OK, however, as all users are wiped out from the Redmine demo portal on a regular basis. To stay on the safe side, for the test user's email, we will use one of the temporary email services – <strong class="source-inline">test_user_testcafe_poc{randomDigits}@sharklasers.com</strong> – and password – <strong class="source-inline">test_user_testcafe_poc</strong>.</p>
			<p>To continue writing test cases in a more structured way, let's break them down into blocks one by one.</p>
			<h3>Creating a new user</h3>
			<p>Follow these<a id="_idIndexMarker027"/> steps to create a new user:</p>

			<p>While this test suite is<a id="_idIndexMarker044"/> relatively simple to build, it allows showcasing some of the most prominent features of TestCafe. Additionally, it demonstrates running the tests against a free and simple-to-use website, and it does not require you to build and deploy you own servers or backend services.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-21"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we reviewed what TestCafe is and its main features. While comparing TestCafe with its old and canonical rival – Selenium – we observed the strong and weak points of both frameworks. The main difference between Selenium and TestCafe is that Selenium is more heavyweight as it runs code through the Selenium server by interacting with the browser process itself, whereas TestCafe inserts a proxy in between that rewrites each URL and injects the test scripts into the browser. It runs as a Node.js process and can perform operations in both Node.js and browser contexts. The primary goal of TestCafe is to provide a modern tool that mitigates main test automation pain points and provides a convenient way to set up, maintain, and create new tests.</p>
			<p>We also went through the testing project and came up with a plan for what test cases should be covered with the upcoming automation.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will dive deeper and see how TestCafe operates under the hood, including what API it has and how built-in wait functions can help us to transform our test cases into a fast and reliable suite of automated tests.</p>
