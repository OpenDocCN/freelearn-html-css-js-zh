    enabled Rayon to leverage his knowledge of JavaScript and web frameworks to build
    complex, scalable web applications. Having been a development team lead, Rayon
    has firsthand knowledge of how large projects can become too complicated and impossible
    to modify and scale as time passes and more features are added. He realizes that
    adding strong typing to your projects is essential in modern web development and
    for him, TypeScript has been a real game-changer.'
