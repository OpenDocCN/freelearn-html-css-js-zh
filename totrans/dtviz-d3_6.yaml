    should tell a story using data and should look good doing it. You want to pull

    how best to transition between a scatterplot and a histogram ([http://vis.berkeley.edu/papers/animated_transitions/](http://vis.berkeley.edu/papers/animated_transitions/))—but

- en: The table itself is a well-done visualization. It may not be beautiful or artistic,
    but emulates the common periodic table perfectly. It immediately draws our attention
    and sticks in our mind because of the familiarity, and presents the data well.
    On the other hand, there's too much going on and there is no emphasis. Rather
    than a story, you get a "here's everything; deal with it".

    the size of these categories. This works because, through years of graphs and
    charts, everyone''s learned that colors are categories. Even before seeing the
    numbers, readers recognize that a bigger circle is a bigger category. Just be
    careful to use area to represent values, not diameter—a diameter half as big produces
    a circle only a quarter as big!'

    used in matrix diagrams where darker means more and lighter means less. It's a
    very natural effect—empty cells are white, and the more points you put in a cell,
    the darker it becomes. Try it with a pen.

    into a two-dimensional medium. How would you plot the relationship between per
    capita income and life expectancy of a nation? A simple line chart, right? But
    how do you incorporate time, add more nations, population, and... let's add region
    just to make things interesting. That's five dimensions!
  prefs: []

    dimensions into two without crowding. Every nation is a bubble on a graph, where
    the vertical axis shows life expectancy and the horizontal axis is per capita
    income. Time is shown as time with an animation, regions are colors, and population
    is circle area.
