- en: Now that we've  built a project with Johnny-Five and Raspi-IO, it's time to
    tackle GPIO expanders and PWM outputs, and build an interactive project with an
    RGB LED. We'll also learn more about the Johnny-Five REPL, learn how a PWM pin
    works, and use this knowledge to control an RGB LED from the command line.

    of the standard LED, the RGB LED—so named because it has a red, green, and blue
    channel, and can replicate thousands of colors. We will use an RGB LED, as well
    as some of the more powerful tools built into Johnny-Five, to build an interactive
    project in this chapter.

    case of RGB LEDs, where the brightness of each channel (red, green, and blue)
    determines the perceived color of the LED. The pins on most microcontrollers are
    digital: they are either HIGH at 5V or LOW at 0V. So how do you adjust the brightness
    of an LED with these types of pins? The answer involves the idea of average voltage
    and the speed at which we can flip a digital pin from HIGH to LOW.'

    us to use RGB LEDs to create thousands of different colors by combining a red,
    green, and blue channel at varying degrees of brightness.'

    to `255` for red, green, and blue. This works well with web hex colors, which

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So why do we need a GPIO expander right off the bat, when the Raspberry Pi has
    so many GPIO pins? This is because PWM pins require computing resources and timers,
    and many microcontrollers have a limited number of hardware PWM pins. You can
    emulate PWM pins with software, but the results tend to be on the unreliable side.
    The Arduino Uno, for example, has eight PWM pins. The Raspberry Pi has only one
    GPIO pin, and many projects (including the servo and motor projects included later
    in this book) will require many more than one, and we do not want to use software
    PWM.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This is why we are using the PCA9685 GPIO expander: it has 16 dedicated PWM
    pins and provides all the resources to run them. It communicates with the Raspberry
    Pi using a protocol called I²C (pronounced *eye-squared-see*), the details of
    which are outside the scope of this book, and are abstracted away in the Johnny-Five
    component object. See the *Further reading* section if you''d like to learn more

    leg wires to ground. The leg by itself on one side of the long leg is the red
    channel; wire that to the 0 column PWM row pin on the PCA9685 board. Green and
    blue are on the other side; wire them to PWM-1 and PWM-2, respectively. Once this
    is all done, your project should look similar to the following:'
