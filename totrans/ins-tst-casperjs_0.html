Unlike Selenium, CasperJS does not automate a locally installed web browser; it behaves as an actual independent web browser.</p><p>To automate a locally installed web browser, CasperJS uses PhantomJS, which is a headless WebKit engine. Well, "headless WebKit engine" might sound like quite a barbaric term, but just imagine this as a WebKit engine (the famous web engine of Chrome and Safari) without a graphical user interface.</p><p>So it is basically a web browser. It can load web pages, apply their CSS, run their JavaScript, interact with their content, and so on; but when we launch it from a command line, we do not see anything on the screen.</p><p>Instead of a standard graphical user interface, PhantomJS offers a JavaScript API so we can control what the browser is doing. By running its own web engine instead of automating an external web browser, PhantomJS is much faster and lighter than Selenium.</p><p>Unfortunately, the PhantomJS JavaScript API is very low level. So by writing a simple interaction scenario rapidly, you could end up with quite a heavy and long script code.</p><p>This is precisely where CasperJS makes its entrance. It comes with two precious assets. Firstly, with a large, high-level API to perform actions such as clicking links, filling forms, and finding elements; and secondly, with the ability to execute those actions sequentially without requiring an endless cascade of JavaScript callbacks.</p><p>Thanks to this, our CasperJS scripts will be just as concise and readable as we wish, which is priceless when dealing with testing.</p><p>CasperJS was created by Nicolas Perriault in 2011, and he is still actively maintaining it. All the CasperJS users are very grateful for it. Thank you Nicolas!</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/><span class="strong"><strong>What this book covers</strong></span></h1></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Installing CasperJS (Simple)</em></span> explains how to properly install PhantomJS and CasperJS plus their system dependencies needed on our machine, step by step.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Getting started with CasperJS (Simple)</em></span> covers how to write basic CasperJS tests. Starting with simple scripts, we will progressively get familiar with the CasperJS approach, discover what kind of assertions can be performed with CasperJS, learn how to establish the proper timing to get an accurate test, and how to record a web session as a CasperJS script.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Writing advanced tests (Intermediate)</em></span> details how to simulate rich web interactions using CasperJS in order to achieve more complex testing, such as handling files, managing authentication, or simulating keyboard and mouse events efficiently.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Best practices (Intermediate)</em></span> focuses on making our tests more accurate and robust and explains how to run them using continuous integration (CI) tools, such as Jenkins or Travis CI.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Beyond testing (Advanced)</em></span> discusses other interesting CasperJS usages such as web scripting and automated screenshot or server-side printing.</p></div></div>
