- en: Chatbots are becoming more and more common in everyday life, with Alexa currently
    being in 16% of households and over 100,000 Facebook chatbots. Chatbots provide
    a way to interact with technology that is a lot more natural for people, through
    conversation.

- en: In this book, we'll learn how to build our own voice and text-based chatbots
    using Amazon Alexa and Lex. These platforms allow us to use very powerful technology
    to understand what the users are saying. We also learn about the design process
    when creating a chatbot and how we can provide a great experience for our users.

    Whether you want to build them for personal projects or as part of your job, this
    book will give you all the tools you need. You'll be able to take an idea, build
    the conversation flow diagrams, test them with user stories, and then build your
    Alexa Skill or Lex chatbot.

- en: '[Chapter 1](90c77e09-3c38-4162-bd4e-6935a897df50.xhtml), *Understanding Chatbots*,
    starts by explaining the concepts involved in building a conversational interface.
    We will learn how to start with an example user conversation and build flow diagrams
    to visualize the path that the user takes with the chatbot. The chapter will then
    discuss the types of chatbots and will introduce us to voice skills for Amazon
    Alexa and text-based chatbots for Amazon Lex.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ac448944-0559-408e-a9c4-972933a03611.xhtml), *Getting Started with
    AWS and Amazon CLI*, teaches us about AWS Lambdas and how these serverless functions
    can be built and tested in the browser. After building our first Lambda, we discuss
    three different ways to build and deploy them, comparing the merits and limits
    of each. To create the most powerful development environment possible, we use
    `aws-cli` to build a script that allows us to deploy Lambdas from our local development
    environment.'

    Alexa Skill*, introduces us to the Alexa Skills Kit and has us build our first
    Alexa Skill. We learn about how to build a Lambda to handle our users'' requests
    and return the response that we want to send to the user. To create a more realistic
    situation, we create a skill that suggests a car for the user, based on a series
    of questions. We use the flow design process discussed in [Chapter 1](90c77e09-3c38-4162-bd4e-6935a897df50.xhtml),
    *Understanding Chatbots*, to map out our users'' interactions with our skill before
    creating the intents. The Lambdas that we use also increase in complexity with
    *slot eliciting* and with the inclusion of data that is stored in S3.'

    Skills to External APIs*, takes our Alexa skills to a new level of functionality
    by accessing external APIs. API access can provide massive amounts of functionality
    to your chatbots, but it needs to be done correctly. We''ll learn about two of
    the best ways to handle errors and use them to build a weather skill.'

    Amazon Lex Chatbot*, moves the focus onto Amazon Lex chatbots. The concepts and
    components are similar to those we used to build our Alexa skills, so we only
    need a quick refresher before building our first Lex chatbot. While Lex and Alexa
    are similar, we quickly see how there are some key differences in the way that
    the intents are handled. To create a more realistic project, we build an FAQ chatbot.
    This Lex chatbot takes advantage of the intent handling by triggering one of three
    Lambdas, based on the intent that was hit. These Lambdas access the responses
    from S3 and reply using a `LexResponses` class, which we will build.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](6f55e868-15db-4cbd-95c0-a7e191cf0392.xhtml), *Connecting a Lex
    Bot to DynamoDB*, introduces us to DynamoDB databases and how we can use them
    to store information about the users'' interactions. We use this to build ourselves
    a shopping chatbot that stores a user''s cart, even allowing them to save their
    cart for later. The complexity of the flows for this chatbot is a lot closer to
    what you would expect from a real project, and that is reflected in the amount
    of code.'

    to Facebook, Slack, Twilio, and HTTP*, teaches us how we can publish our chatbots
    and integrate them into platforms, including Facebook and Slack. We use Amazon
    Lex''s built-in integration tools to make this process as easy as possible. Next,
    we build an API endpoint, using API Gateway and Lambdas, so that we can develop
    integrations for other services. We use this API ourselves to create our own front-end
    interface, which we could integrate into other websites.'

- en: '[Chapter 8](78bc7277-515a-4a49-8ace-6726512c3862.xhtml), *Improving User Experience
    for Your Bots*, discusses a few ways to make the experiences of your users more
    enjoyable. This covers creating and sending cards in Lex conversations and using
    *search query* slot types in Alexa skills. Cards provide the user with a much
    more visual interaction, while *search query* slots allow a user to search for
    a much wider range of values that we could allow with a custom or built-in slot
    type.'

    Development*, gives us a few pointers on the directions we can go to continue
    developing our chatbot skills. There are separate pieces of advice for people
    who prefer Alexa, and those who want to pursue more Lex skills, as well as a set
    of skills that will improve your abilities with both chatbot platforms. After
    this, we discuss the future of chatbots, where they are going, and what needs
    to happen before they become truly integrated into our daily lives.'
