			<h1 id="_idParaDest-98"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor098"/>Chapter 7</em>: Creating Multiple Choice and Fill-in-the-blank Quizzes using Google Forms</h1>
			<p>Now that we have explored using grade-written assignments with a rubric, the <strong class="bold">Quiz</strong> feature of Google Forms will help grade multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, and numeric questions. First, you will need to create the assignment and deploy it on Google Classroom. Google Forms' app within Google's Workspace for Education allows you to create online surveys, which you can use as assignments. The results are found within Google Forms or are linked to a Google Sheet.</p>
			<p>After using Quiz with Google Forms for assignments, you may decide to also use it for exams. However, while Google Forms provides a means for creating the assessment and Google Classroom allows you to easily distribute it to your students, there are limited tools for maintaining the security of an assessment. Security for Google Forms can only be ensured when students are using Chromebooks enrolled in the school network.</p>
			<p>Therefore, if you choose to use this tool for summative assessment, you will need to determine an appropriate level of security. (Often, there is nothing that prevents students from opening a new tab and searching for an answer or messaging classmates when completing a form remotely.) For example, in my classroom, I adjusted the desks so that there was room at the back of the classroom to pace during a summative assessment. Additionally, some school labs have a teacher desktop that includes software to monitor student desktops. Whatever method you choose, take precautions to ensure the authenticity of student results when assessing students online.</p>
			<p>Google Forms is a vast Google app that would require its own book to fully explore its functionality. Therefore, the various features you will explore in this chapter will focus on creating and assessing multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank assignments. However, once you are familiar with Google Forms, you will find additional applications for it. For example, in my school, I work with administration to create forms to collect survey data from stakeholders such as staff, students, and parents.</p>
			<p>Recently, for our school's annual Open House, I created a form to guide prospective students through selecting their first-year courses (the COVID-19 pandemic prevented in-person consultations with schools during registration). Also, during our school's major fundraiser, I developed a Google Form for students to record donations so that reports could be generated from the information more quickly than ever before. The possibilities of using Google Forms within a school environment are endless!</p>
			<p>In this chapter, you will explore the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Creating an assignment with Google Forms</li>
				<li>Assigning a Google Form in Google Classroom</li>
				<li>Tips and tricks when creating Google Form assignments<p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">Google Forms' Quiz feature focuses on ease of use rather than functionality. In the previous edition of this book, this chapter explored the third-party add-on <strong class="bold">Flubaroo</strong>, which requires more setup but offers additional features such as giving partial marks when selecting multiple items from a list. At the time of the previous edition's writing, the Quiz feature was new and did not have the same functionality as is explored in this chapter.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-99"><a id="_idTextAnchor099"/>Creating a Google Form</h1>
			<p>While it is <a id="_idIndexMarker344"/>possible to create a Google Forms quiz from Classroom, these steps will begin in the Google Forms app so that you can create Google Forms for a wider range of purposes.</p>
			<p>Since Google Forms is not as well known as Gmail or Google Calendar, it may not be immediately visible in the app launcher. To create a Google Form, follow these instructions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the app launcher, scroll down within the launcher and click on the <strong class="bold">Forms</strong> icon:<div id="_idContainer319" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.1_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.1 – Forms icon in the app launcher&#13;&#10;" width="417" height="572"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.1 – Forms icon in the app launcher</p><p class="callout-heading">Tip</p><p class="callout">If there is still no Google Forms app icon, open a new tab and type <strong class="source-inline">forms.google.com</strong> into the address bar.</p></li>
				<li>Click <a id="_idIndexMarker345"/>on the <strong class="bold">Blank</strong> template to create a new Google Form:<div id="_idContainer320" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.2_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.2 – Blank form thumbnail in the Forms app&#13;&#10;" width="1030" height="307"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.2 – Blank form thumbnail in the Forms app</p></li>
				<li>To name the Google Form, click on <strong class="bold">Untitled</strong> in the top left and type in the name. This will change the name of the form. If necessary, you can click on the form title to change the title afterward:<div id="_idContainer321" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.3_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.3 – Form filename and title&#13;&#10;" width="864" height="340"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.3 – Form filename and title</p></li>
				<li>Optionally, you<a id="_idIndexMarker346"/> can add a <strong class="bold">description</strong> to the Google Form directly below the form title:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer322" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.4 – Form description field</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Often, I will use the description to provide further instructions or information such as the time limit, whether dictionaries or other reference books are permissible, or even website addresses for where students can find information related to the assignment.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-100"><a id="_idTextAnchor100"/>Adding questions to a Google Form</h2>
			<p>By default, each <a id="_idIndexMarker347"/>new Google Form will already have a <a id="_idIndexMarker348"/>multiple-choice card inserted into the form:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In order to access the options, click anywhere along the white area beside <strong class="bold">Untitled Question</strong>:<div id="_idContainer323" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.5_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.5 – Inactive question card&#13;&#10;" width="747" height="141"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.5 – Inactive question card</p><p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker349"/> question will expand to form a question<a id="_idIndexMarker350"/> card where you can make changes to the question:</p><div id="_idContainer324" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.6_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.6 – An active question card&#13;&#10;" width="916" height="367"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.6 – An active question card</p></li>
				<li>Type the question stem in the <strong class="bold">Untitled Question</strong> line. Then click on <strong class="bold">Option 1</strong> to create a field to change it to a selection:<div id="_idContainer325" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.7_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.7 – Multiple choice selectors&#13;&#10;" width="1108" height="246"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.7 – Multiple choice selectors</p></li>
				<li>To add additional selectors, click on the <strong class="bold">Add Option</strong> text below the current selector or simply press the <em class="italic">Enter</em> key on the keyboard to begin the next selector.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Because of the<a id="_idIndexMarker351"/> large number of options in a question card, the<a id="_idIndexMarker352"/> following screenshot provides a brief description of these options:</p>
			<div>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.8 – Question card features</p>
			<p>The description of each option is as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">Question title</strong>: The stem of the multiple-choice question.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Move option indicator</strong>: Hovering your mouse over an option will show this indicator, which you can click and drag to re-order your options. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Question options</strong>: Contains advanced settings such as randomizing the option order.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Move question indicator</strong>: Clicking and dragging this indicator will allow you to reorder your questions within the assignment.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Question title image icon</strong>: Clicking this icon will add an image below the title text.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Question type drop-down menu</strong>: There are several types of questions you can choose from: short answer, paragraph, multiple choice, checkboxes, dropdown, linear scale, multiple <a id="_idIndexMarker353"/>choice grid, date, and time. However, not <a id="_idIndexMarker354"/>all will work with the Quiz feature.<p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">Google Forms' Quiz feature matches the responses of the students with an answer key. It cannot effectively grade answers in sentence or paragraph form. The only questions fields that offer automatic grading are short answer, multiple choice, checkboxes, dropdown, multiple choice grid, and checkbox grid.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Question selector image icon</strong>: This icon appears only when the selector is active or the mouse is hovering over the selector. Clicking this icon will upload an image for the selector. The image still requires text in the selector.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Remove option icon</strong>: Deletes the multiple choice option.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Duplicate question button</strong>: Google Forms will make a copy of the current question.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Delete question button</strong>: Deletes the question card.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Required question switch</strong>: When this option is enabled, students must answer the given question in order to complete the assignment.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">More options menu</strong>: Depending on the type of question, this section will provide options to enable a hint field below the question title field, create non-linear multiple-choice assignments, and validate data entered into a specific field.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you have <a id="_idIndexMarker355"/>completed editing your question, you can use the side<a id="_idIndexMarker356"/> menu to add additional questions to your assignment. You can also add section headings, images, YouTube videos, and additional sections to your assignment. The following screenshot provides a brief legend for the icons:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.9 – Google Forms content menu</p>
			<p>To create a <em class="italic">fill-in-the-blank</em> question, use the short answer question type. When writing the question stem, use underscores to indicate where the blank is in the question. You may need to adjust the wording of your fill-in-the-blank questions when using Google Forms. An example of a fill-in-the-blank question follows:</p>

			<p class="callout-heading">Identify your students</p>
			<p class="callout">Be sure to include fields for your student's name. Furthermore, Google Forms also has an option to automatically collect the respondent's email in the Google Form's settings, found in the <em class="italic">gear</em> icon. Often, I enable automatic email collection so that I can confirm the name submitted in the Google Form matches the email account used to complete it.</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-101"><a id="_idTextAnchor101"/>Changing the theme of a Google Form</h2>
			<p>Once you have all the <a id="_idIndexMarker359"/>questions in your Google Form, you can<a id="_idIndexMarker360"/> change the look and feel of the Google Form. To change the theme of your assignment, use the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Click on the paint pallet icon in the top-right corner of the Google Form:<div id="_idContainer329" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.11_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.11 – Customize theme icon&#13;&#10;" width="523" height="123"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.11 – Customize theme icon</p></li>
				<li>For colors, select the desired color from the <strong class="bold">THEME COLOR</strong> section. The <strong class="bold">BACKGROUND COLOR</strong> section will then suggest new colors to match. If you want to use a custom color, click on the plus icon in the <strong class="bold">THEME COLOR</strong> section:<div id="_idContainer330" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.12_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.12 – Add custom color icon&#13;&#10;" width="361" height="393"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.12 – Add custom color icon</p></li>
				<li>A color grid will <a id="_idIndexMarker361"/>appear, where you can select the <a id="_idIndexMarker362"/>color and shade. Alternatively, if you know the hexadecimal code for the specific color, you can enter it in the <strong class="bold">Hex</strong> field:<div id="_idContainer331" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.13_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.13 – Custom color options&#13;&#10;" width="639" height="477"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.13 – Custom color options</p><p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">While customizing the theme color is possible, Google Forms does not provide an option to customize the background color with colors other than those the app offers.</p></li>
				<li>If you would like to add a header image, click on the <strong class="bold">Choose image</strong> button in the <strong class="bold">HEADER</strong> section:<div id="_idContainer332" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.14_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.14 – Add header image button&#13;&#10;" width="522" height="263"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.14 – Add header image button</p></li>
				<li>When<a id="_idIndexMarker363"/> choosing a theme image, you can narrow <a id="_idIndexMarker364"/>the type of theme visible by clicking on the appropriate category in the left sidebar:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer333" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_7.15_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.15 – Theme image categories&#13;&#10;" width="992" height="405"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.15 – Theme image categories</p>
			<p>Additional categories not shown in the screenshot include <strong class="bold">Party</strong>, <strong class="bold">Just kids</strong>, <strong class="bold">Wedding</strong>, <strong class="bold">Night out</strong>, <strong class="bold">Sports and games</strong>, <strong class="bold">Travel</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Other</strong>.</p>
			<p>Another option is to upload your own image as the theme. Click on the <strong class="bold">UPLOAD</strong> tab at the top and browse for an image or select one from your Google Photos using the <strong class="bold">PHOTOS</strong> tab.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">When adding a header image, Google Forms will overwrite the current color theme to match the header image. You can still adjust the theme and background color afterward.</p>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker365"/>applications for Google Forms within the classroom <a id="_idIndexMarker366"/>are vast. With the preceding features, you can add images and videos to your Google Form. Furthermore, in conjunction with Google Classroom assignments, you can add both a Google Doc and a Google Form to the same assignment. An example of an application is to create an assignment in Google Classroom where students must first watch an attached YouTube video and then answer questions in a Google Form. Then, Google Forms will grade the assignment and you can email the students their results.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-102"><a id="_idTextAnchor102"/>Converting a Google Form into a quiz</h2>
			<p>Using the Google<a id="_idIndexMarker367"/> Form quiz template simplifies the setup<a id="_idIndexMarker368"/> for grading Google Forms. However, only short answer, multiple choice, choose from a list, dropdown, and grid questions are the question types that Google Forms can grade automatically. Therefore, it does not allow for paragraph questions.</p>
			<p>Question types that cannot be automatically graded can still have points assigned to each question. Someone will have to assess and manually enter the points received for each submission. Since this chapter started with a non-quiz Google Form, to convert a Google Form into a quiz, use the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Click on the settings gear:<div id="_idContainer334" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.16_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.16 – The Settings Gear icon&#13;&#10;" width="861" height="189"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.16 – The Settings Gear icon</p></li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Quizzes</strong> section:<div id="_idContainer335" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.17_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.17 – The Quizzes tab in the Form settings&#13;&#10;" width="795" height="141"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.17 – The Quizzes tab in the Form settings</p></li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Make this a quiz</strong> switch:<div id="_idContainer336" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.18_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.18 – The Make this a quiz switch&#13;&#10;" width="769" height="211"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.18 – The Make this a quiz switch</p></li>
				<li>The first <a id="_idIndexMarker369"/>quiz option determines whether a <a id="_idIndexMarker370"/>student will be able to access the quiz on any device or only a school-enrolled Chromebook. When locked mode is enabled, students cannot use other apps, some extensions and keyboard shortcuts are disabled, and if the student pre-emptively closes the quiz (without submitting) or opens another tab while completing the quiz, you will receive an email:<div id="_idContainer337" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.19_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.19 – Quiz locked mode switch&#13;&#10;" width="841" height="194"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.19 – Quiz locked mode switch</p></li>
				<li>The other quiz options set whether Google Forms will automatically email students after their submission and what information they will receive. For example, a student<a id="_idIndexMarker371"/> can view the correct answer to the <a id="_idIndexMarker372"/>questions within the form. The following is a screenshot of all available options:<div id="_idContainer338" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.20_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.20 – Forms quiz options&#13;&#10;" width="430" height="515"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.20 – Forms quiz options</p></li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Save</strong> button at the bottom of the dialog box to save the changes.<p class="callout-heading">Summative assessment settings</p><p class="callout">Whenever I create an assessment where I am recording student results, I change the quiz settings to release the grades after manual review and uncheck all settings for what the students can see (missed questions, correct answers, and point values). Then, the email students receive when their score is released will only contain their results.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-103"><a id="_idTextAnchor103"/>Creating an answer key in Google Forms</h2>
			<p>Now that the<a id="_idIndexMarker373"/> Google Form is a quiz, each question card <a id="_idIndexMarker374"/>will have a new link called an answer key, at the bottom of the card. Use the following directions to add an answer key to a multiple choice, dropdown, or checkbox question card:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Click on the <strong class="bold">Answer key</strong> link at the bottom of the question card:<div id="_idContainer339" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.21_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.21 – The Answer key link&#13;&#10;" width="562" height="166"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.21 – The Answer key link</p></li>
				<li>Assign the<a id="_idIndexMarker375"/> points value for the question at the<a id="_idIndexMarker376"/> top right of the card (I often accidentally forget this step):<div id="_idContainer340" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.22_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.22 – The points value of the question&#13;&#10;" width="462" height="51"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.22 – The points value of the question</p></li>
				<li>Click the answer that is correct:<div id="_idContainer341" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.23_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.23 – Selecting the correct answer to the question&#13;&#10;" width="754" height="423"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.23 – Selecting the correct answer to the question</p><p>You can select multiple options; however, the Google Form answer key grades some question types differently. For multiple choice or dropdown questions, any correct option will mark the answer as correct; however, checkbox questions <a id="_idIndexMarker377"/>require all selections to mark the answer <a id="_idIndexMarker378"/>as correct.</p></li>
				<li>Clicking the <strong class="bold">Done</strong> button will save the answer and return you to the question card. A checkmark will appear beside the correct answer when the question card is expanded:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer342" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_7.24_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.24 – The correct option indicator in the question card&#13;&#10;" width="894" height="260"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.24 – The correct option indicator in the question card</p>
			<p>For short answer questions, the answer key allows you to input correct responses. It is possible to have multiple correct responses so that you can account for the multiple ways that students may enter information. For example, a student may choose to capitalize a word, or they may accidentally add a space after the word.</p>
			<p>The answer key<a id="_idIndexMarker379"/> will not adjust for these differences. Therefore, to <a id="_idIndexMarker380"/>minimize fixing after students submit their answers, inputting multiple versions of the same answer can help the form grade student responses correctly. An example of possible correct answers for a question is as follows:</p>

			<p class="callout">The <em class="italic">Tips and tricks when creating Google Forms assignments</em> section of this chapter will include strategies to mitigate this problem.</p>
			<h3>Providing answer feedback</h3>
			<p>The answer key can<a id="_idIndexMarker381"/> also automatically provide feedback to students. Question feedback could include text, web page links, or even a YouTube video. If the question type is one that Google Forms can automatically grade, different feedback can be given depending on whether the student answers the question correctly or incorrectly. To add feedback to questions, use the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In the answer key section of a question card, click on <strong class="bold">Add answer feedback</strong>:<div id="_idContainer344" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.26_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.26 – The Add answer feedback link&#13;&#10;" width="650" height="79"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.26 – The Add answer feedback link</p></li>
				<li>In the dialog box, the default tab is <strong class="bold">Incorrect answers</strong>. Add text, website links, and/or YouTube videos, as necessary:<div id="_idContainer345" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.27_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.27 – Feedback dialog box&#13;&#10;" width="477" height="212"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.27 – Feedback dialog box</p></li>
				<li>If desired, click on the <strong class="bold">Correct answers</strong> tab to add different feedback for when the question is correct:<div id="_idContainer346" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.28_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.28 – Correct answers tab&#13;&#10;" width="554" height="91"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.28 – Correct answers tab</p></li>
				<li>Click on<a id="_idIndexMarker382"/> the <strong class="bold">Save</strong> button to save changes:</li>
			</ol>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.29 – Complete the question feedback</p>
			<p>For question cards that cannot automatically grade (such as paragraph questions), the feedback will be automatically given to each student. Later in the chapter, in the <em class="italic">Grading Google Forms quizzes</em> section, additional features such as giving individual feedback are explored.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Be careful when giving feedback automatically using this method. If the quiz is set to return the student's grade immediately, they will see the feedback right away. Students may be able to identify which questions they correctly submitted from the feedback the email provides them.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-104"><a id="_idTextAnchor104"/>Assigning a Google Form in Google Classroom</h1>
			<p>Before you assign your <a id="_idIndexMarker383"/>Google Form to your students, preview it. By doing this first, you will catch any errors before sending the assignment to your students, and it will be easier to find when you have to grade the assignment later. Click on the eye-shaped preview icon in the top-right corner of the Google Form to go to the live form:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer348" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_7.30_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.30 – The preview live form icon&#13;&#10;" width="739" height="173"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.30 – The preview live form icon</p>
			<p>Fill out the form with all the correct answers. To find this entry later, I usually enter <strong class="source-inline">KEY</strong> in the name field and my own email address for the email field. Once you've checked that the Google Form behaves as expected (especially with releasing grades), it is ready to be assigned in Google Classroom.</p>
			<p>In Google Classroom, once students have submitted a Google Form, Google Classroom will automatically mark the assignment as turned in. Therefore, if you are adding multiple files to an assignment, add the Google Form last and avoid adding multiple Google Forms to a single assignment. To add a Google Form to an assignment, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> section, create an assignment post by selecting <strong class="bold">Assignment</strong>. <em class="italic">Do not</em> select <strong class="bold">Quiz assignment</strong>:<div id="_idContainer349" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.31_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.31 – Create an assignment in the Classwork section&#13;&#10;" width="594" height="319"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.31 – Create an assignment in the Classwork section</p><p>Selecting <strong class="bold">Quiz assignment</strong> creates an assignment post with a blank Google Forms quiz.

				<li>Add a file <a id="_idIndexMarker384"/>from <strong class="bold">Google Drive</strong>:<div id="_idContainer350" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.32_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.32 – Add a Google Drive file&#13;&#10;" width="692" height="483"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.32 – Add a Google Drive file</p></li>

				<li>Add any additional information and assign the assignment. If the assignment uses a Google Forms quiz, no additional steps are required.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once the students have<a id="_idIndexMarker386"/> completed the Google Form, it is ready to be assessed and returned.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-105"><a id="_idTextAnchor105"/>Grading Google Forms quizzes</h2>
			<p>The student <a id="_idIndexMarker387"/>submissions and grades are found in the Google Forms app. To view the Google Form responses, click on the <strong class="bold">Responses</strong> tab at the top of the Forms app:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer353" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_7.35_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.35 – The Reponses tab of the Google Forms app&#13;&#10;" width="867" height="197"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.35 – The Reponses tab of the Google Forms app</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Responses</strong> tab will also show the current number of Google Form submissions. Within the <strong class="bold">Response</strong> page, there are three additional tabs –<strong class="bold">Summary</strong>, <strong class="bold">Question</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Individual</strong>. Many assessment grading tools such as Scantron and SmarterMarks have similar statistical breakdowns of the assessment. Therefore, many of these tabs may be familiar. </p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Summary</strong> tab provides an overview of the results, including the average, median, and range. It also provides graphs and tables to view student scores and the frequency of answers for each question. An image of the <strong class="bold">Summary</strong> tab is shown in the following figure:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer354" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_7.36_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.36 – Google Form responses Summary page&#13;&#10;" width="733" height="1227"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.36 – Google Form responses Summary page</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Question</strong> tab <a id="_idIndexMarker388"/>provides in-depth information about each question. Only one question is viewable at a time and the page provides buttons to change whether a specific response is correct or incorrect and the points value of each response. An image of the <strong class="bold">Question</strong> tab is shown here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer355" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.37 – Google Form responses Question page</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Individual</strong> tab<a id="_idIndexMarker389"/> provides a view of each student's submission. In this view, each question response has an <strong class="bold">Add individual feedback</strong> button:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer356" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.38 – The Add individual feedback button</p>
			<p>Clicking this button opens a dialog box where you can add text, website links, and YouTube videos.</p>
			<p>This section is also where you can assign points to question types that are not automatically graded, such as paragraph questions. These questions appear incorrect until points are assigned. Any<a id="_idIndexMarker390"/> changes to the points of an individual submission must be saved:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer357" class="IMG---Figure">

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-106"><a id="_idTextAnchor106"/>Manually releasing grades to students</h2>
			<p>If you have been <a id="_idIndexMarker391"/>following along through this chapter, students will not receive their Google Forms quiz results until you release them. There are two places in Google Forms where you can release the students' scores. The first is the <strong class="bold">Release scores</strong> button found in the <strong class="bold">Scores</strong> section of the <strong class="bold">Summary</strong> page, shown here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer358" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_7.40_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.40 – The Release scores button on the Summary page&#13;&#10;" width="863" height="268"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.40 – The Release scores button on the Summary page</p>
			<p>Clicking this button will bring up a dialog box where you can write a message and select which students receive their results:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer359" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_7.41_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.41 – Release scores dialog box&#13;&#10;" width="587" height="374"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.41 – Release scores dialog box</p>
			<p>The second location to release scores is the <strong class="bold">Release score</strong> button found at the top of a response's <strong class="bold">Individual</strong> page, shown here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer360" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_7.42_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.42 – The Release score button on the Individual page&#13;&#10;" width="750" height="309"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.42 – The Release score button on the Individual page</p>
			<p>Clicking this button <a id="_idIndexMarker392"/>will bring up the same dialog box as the <strong class="bold">Release scores</strong> button on the <strong class="bold">Summary</strong> page. However, only the current student will be selected by default, rather than all students.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-107"><a id="_idTextAnchor107"/>Linking a Google Sheets spreadsheet</h2>
			<p>Responses from Google <a id="_idIndexMarker393"/>Forms can also be linked to a Google Sheets spreadsheet (often called a <strong class="bold">Google Sheet</strong>). There are several advantages to linking to a Google Sheet, such as spreadsheet formulas for statistical analysis (for bell-curved courses), custom graphing, and sharing only the responses through the Google Sheet instead of the entire Google Form.</p>
			<p>To link a Google Sheet to a Google Form, start on the Google Form's <strong class="bold">Responses</strong> page:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Click on the Google Sheets icon:<div id="_idContainer361" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.43_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.43 – The Google Sheets icon&#13;&#10;" width="874" height="215"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.43 – The Google Sheets icon</p></li>
				<li>Select <a id="_idIndexMarker394"/>whether to create a new Google Sheet or add the responses to an existing Google Sheet:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer362" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_7.44_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.44 – Google Sheets destination dialog box&#13;&#10;" width="544" height="247"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.44 – Google Sheets destination dialog box</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">If creating a linked Google Sheet, it will be found in the same folder as the Google Form in Google Drive. Reorganizing the Google Form or Google Sheet location will not break the link.</p>
			<p>Most often, creating a new Google Sheet is the primary selection. However, there may be instances, such as when releasing similar Google Forms to different classes, where having all the responses in one Google Sheet improves the workflow.</p>
			<p>Data travels from the Google Form to the Google Sheet, but not in the other direction. Therefore, making any changes to fields in the Google Sheet, such as the points column, will not make changes to the Google Form. Furthermore, any custom changes in the Google Sheet will be overwritten by the Google Form. For example, if you are updating points in the Google Sheet and you then press the <strong class="bold">Release scores</strong> button in the Google Form, the Google Form will re-populate the points column with data from the Google Form.</p>
			<p>Once a <a id="_idIndexMarker395"/>spreadsheet is linked, the <strong class="bold">Form</strong> menu on the spreadsheet will have options to go to the live Google Form and edit it, as shown here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer363" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.45 – The Form menu in Google Sheet</p>
			<p>The applications of data collected through Google Forms and processed through Google Sheets are many (they extend far beyond the scope of this book). The next section provides some additional suggestions and advanced features to improve your workflow.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-108"><a id="_idTextAnchor108"/>Tips and tricks when creating Google Form assignments</h1>
			<p>Now that you have created a<a id="_idIndexMarker396"/> Google Form and graded it with the Quiz feature, there are several additional settings in Google Forms that are beneficial in the classroom. Here are 10 tips and tricks that you can use when creating Google Form assignments and exams for your students:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">If a student needs to resubmit a Google Form quiz, delete the first submission from the <strong class="bold">Individual</strong> page of <strong class="bold">Responses</strong>:<div id="_idContainer364" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.46_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.46 – Delete response icon&#13;&#10;" width="1067" height="436"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.46 – Delete response icon</p><p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">If you have a linked spreadsheet, deleting a response does not remove that submission from the spreadsheet.</p></li>
				<li>You can <a id="_idIndexMarker397"/>choose whether to make a Google Form accessible to anyone or limit it to users within the school district. The drop-down menu to change this setting is found within the settings gear of the Google Form. Be sure to click the <strong class="bold">Save</strong> button at the bottom of the settings popup:<div id="_idContainer365" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.47_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.47 – Restricting a Google Form to users in the organization&#13;&#10;" width="1083" height="451"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.47 – Restricting a Google Form to users in the organization</p></li>
				<li>By default, students can submit a Google Form multiple times. Google Forms quizzes will display all submissions from a student in the <strong class="bold">Responses</strong> section, and Google Classroom will mark the assignment as turned in after the first submission. While this feature may be useful so that students have an opportunity to achieve a higher grade if they redo the assignment, you may want to prevent students from resubmitting a Google Form, for example, if you use a Google Form as a quiz. In the settings gear, you can check the checkbox beside <strong class="bold">Limit to 1 response</strong> (requires login):<div id="_idContainer366" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.48_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.48 – The Limit to 1 response checkbox in the settings gear&#13;&#10;" width="1110" height="286"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.48 – The Limit to 1 response checkbox in the settings gear</p></li>
				<li>Google <a id="_idIndexMarker398"/>Forms can shuffle the order in which questions appear. This feature can prevent students from copying a classmate's answers because there is a lower likelihood that a student will be able to follow another student's screen. By checking the checkbox beside <strong class="bold">Shuffle question order</strong> found under the <strong class="bold">Presentation</strong> section, when students complete the assignment, Google Forms will shuffle the order of the sections. Questions will need to be created in separate sections:<div id="_idContainer367" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.49_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.49 – The Shuffle question order setting&#13;&#10;" width="930" height="291"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.49 – The Shuffle question order setting</p><p>When using this selection, have the Google Form automatically collect the student's username, else the <strong class="bold">Name</strong> and <strong class="bold">Email</strong> fields will be shuffled among the rest of the questions within the assignment.</p><p class="callout-heading">Shuffling questions with media</p><p class="callout">For questions that require students to view an image, video, or other media and answer multiple questions, separate questions using page sections so that Google Forms will shuffle the page sections instead of each individual question.</p></li>
				<li>Similar to <a id="_idIndexMarker399"/>shuffling the question order, you are also able to shuffle the selections within a multiple-choice question. In the more options menu of the question card, select <strong class="bold">Shuffle option order</strong>:<div id="_idContainer368" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.50_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.50 – Shuffle option order in the question card menu&#13;&#10;" width="767" height="372"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.50 – Shuffle option order in the question card menu</p><p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">Neither shuffling questions nor shuffling multiple-choice selections will affect the quiz template. The <strong class="bold">Responses</strong> section and linked Google Sheet display each question result in columns that are unaffected by the shuffling within the Google Form.</p></li>
				<li>Another feature of multiple-choice and dropdown question types is having specific selections navigate the student to a different question. For example, if a student chooses the correction selector, they will go to a harder question, but if they get the question wrong, they will go to an easier question. You will need to create each question in its own section and select <strong class="bold">Go to section based on answer</strong> in the more<a id="_idIndexMarker400"/> options menu of the question card. Then, each selector will have a drop-down menu to choose where the student will navigate next. You can even have a selector to submit the Google Form:<div id="_idContainer369" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.51_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.51 – Non-linear quizzes using multiple-choice questions&#13;&#10;" width="1109" height="570"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.51 – Non-linear quizzes using multiple-choice questions</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Response validation</strong> in short-answer questions can confirm whether an entry matches a specific pattern such as an email or URL. This feature is found in the more options menu of the question card:<div id="_idContainer370" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.52_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.52 – Response validation in question card menu&#13;&#10;" width="1031" height="483"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.52 – Response validation in question card menu</p><p>Using <strong class="bold">Response validation</strong> will also reduce the chances of students entering something that is <a id="_idIndexMarker401"/>not the correct answer. A simple solution for numeric response questions is to set <strong class="bold">Response validation</strong> to check whether an entry is a number.</p></li>
				<li>Another application of <strong class="bold">Response validation</strong> is password protecting your Google Form. In the data validation settings of a short answer, change the validation type to <strong class="bold">Regular expression</strong>, which matches a pattern. The pattern field will be the password. To ensure the password is exact, begin the password with <strong class="bold">^</strong> and end it with <strong class="bold">$</strong>. Whatever is between the two symbols will be the password. For example, the correct password for <strong class="bold">^Cookies$</strong> is Cookies. Set the question to a required question and place it in its own section at the start of the Google Form. Users will not be able to continue until they input the correct password:<div id="_idContainer371" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.53_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.53 – Sample password question card&#13;&#10;" width="1041" height="415"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.53 – Sample password question card</p><p>I have password protected my Google Forms for quizzes and exams so that students cannot <a id="_idIndexMarker402"/>start early. It also prevents students who are not in class from accessing the Google Form. Once the quiz or exam is complete, I disable <strong class="bold">Accepting Responses</strong> in the <strong class="bold">Responses</strong> tab of the Google Form.</p><p>If you choose to use this feature in your Google Forms, you will not be able to shuffle the question order because then, the password section may not be the first section the students will see.</p></li>
				<li>You can change the text that appears on the confirmation page once the form is submitted. If you place a URL in this section, students will be able to click on it. The confirmation page settings are found in the <strong class="bold">Presentation</strong> section of <strong class="bold">Settings</strong>:<div id="_idContainer372" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_7.54_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 7.54 – Presentation tab in Settings&#13;&#10;" width="726" height="477"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.54 – Presentation tab in Settings</p></li>
				<li>Google Forms also <a id="_idIndexMarker403"/>contains add-ons! You can explore additional third-party add-ons that can enhance your forms. To open <strong class="bold">Add-ons</strong>, click on <strong class="bold">Add-ons</strong> in the Google Forms more options menu:</li>

			<p>I have heard many stories of Google Form assessments going sideways because of improper settings. For<a id="_idIndexMarker404"/> example, a teacher accidentally gave all students edit access to a Google Forms quiz. Not only did the students have all the correct answers to the quiz, but they also modified many questions. The teacher had to reschedule and create a new assessment because of the mistake. Following some of these tips and tricks may help you avoid these problems when using Google Forms within Google Classroom. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-109"><a id="_idTextAnchor109"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>Throughout this chapter, you have learned how to create a Google Form, convert it to a quiz, create an answer key, assign it in Google Classroom, and grade it. Using Google Forms and Google Sheets to enhance Google Classroom shows how the apps in Google's Workspace for Education interact with each other to provide a powerful tool for you. Not only does Google Forms allow you to create and assign multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank questions, but you now also have tips on shuffling question order, password protecting your forms, and ensuring that students only submit a Google Form once.</p>
			<p>With Google Forms, your Google Classroom assignments can include non-linear question orders, multiple opportunities for students to demonstrate their understanding, immediate feedback, and automatic grading. What began as a chapter to save time on grading multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank questions has provided tools to expand the types of assignments you can give your students. Google Classroom no longer only manages assignments, but it can also manage quizzes and exams.</p>
			<p>With grading assignments in Google Classroom covered by Google Docs and the Grading tool from the previous chapter and Google Forms and Google Sheets in this one, in the next chapter, we will explore how Google Calendar and Google Sites can help easily communicate information within Google Classroom to parents.</p>
