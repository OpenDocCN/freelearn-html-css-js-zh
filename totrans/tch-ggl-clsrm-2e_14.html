			<p>In early 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic. Since then, companies have scrambled to pivot to at-home and online operations. Schools around the world were no different. Hopefully, by the time you are reading this chapter, COVID-19 is only referenced in historical archives, but it was the catalyst for a global movement toward online teaching and learning tools. <strong class="bold">Google Meet</strong>, a video conferencing app launched in 2017, expanded from hosting meetings of up to 30 attendees with limited features to being a large-scale communication tool.</p>
			<p>From 2021, Google Meet can host online video conferences of up to 250 participants and up to 100,000 view-only guests. At the time of writing, Google has already announced several more features launching in Google Meet later this year. Because of the sudden move to online teaching and learning, Google Meet is now an integral part of Google Classroom. This chapter will focus on enabling Google Meet and provide an overview of Google Meet's features, while the next chapter will provide pedagogical strategies for teaching online.</p>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you will be able to do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Turn on Google Meet in Google Classroom.</li>
				<li>Join and direct students to join a meeting.</li>
				<li>Change settings such as audio and video inputs, student webcam layouts, and host controls.</li>
				<li>Share content on your screen.</li>
				<li>Post Q&amp;As and polls and place students in breakout rooms.</li>
				<li>Record a meeting.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Because<a id="_idIndexMarker492"/> not every class in Classroom <a id="_idIndexMarker493"/>requires video conferencing, Google Meet is disabled by default. To enable a unique Google Meet link, click on the <strong class="bold">Generate Meet link</strong> button on the banner in the class <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>, shown here:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.1_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.1 – Generate Meet link URL&#13;&#10;" width="601" height="201"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.1 – Generate Meet link URL</p>
			<p>A dialog box will appear with a button to generate the Meet link, shown below. It displays the meet link and a switch to enable or disable the Meet link for students:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.2 – Generate Meet link dialog box</p>
			<p>After saving the <strong class="bold">Meet link</strong> settings, the Meet link will appear in the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong> banner, where teachers and students are able to click the link to start the meeting:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.3_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.3 – Meet link in stream banner&#13;&#10;" width="738" height="223"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.3 – Meet link in stream banner</p>
			<p>On mobile, the Google Meet icon will appear at the top of the stream:</p>

			<p>Android <a id="_idIndexMarker494"/>and iOS devices must also have the<a id="_idIndexMarker495"/> Google Meet app installed on the device to use Google Meet.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important</p>
			<p class="callout">While the user interface is similar on desktop and mobile, there are slight differences. For simplicity, the rest of the chapter will use screenshots from a desktop computer or laptop.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-130"><a id="_idTextAnchor130"/>Changing the Meet link</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Meet link</strong> <a id="_idIndexMarker496"/>within a Google classroom uses a meeting nickname, not its ID. If no current Google Meet is associated with the nickname, Google Meet will create a new meeting. While the <strong class="bold">Meet link</strong> and <strong class="bold">Meet ID</strong> are both 10-letter combinations, the Meet ID changes with each new meeting. The following screenshot illustrates the difference between the <strong class="bold">Meet link</strong> and the Meet ID:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.5_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.5 – Meet link nickname versus Meet ID address&#13;&#10;" width="738" height="80"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.5 – Meet link nickname versus Meet ID address</p>
			<p>This feature is used to increase security so that sharing a Google Meet ID will only affect a single Google Meet session. However, it is also possible to share the <strong class="bold">Meet link</strong>, which can cause unexpected complications. During the first few months of emergency online teaching, many students would invade Google Meets of friends in different schools, causing a ruckus within the session (at that time, Google Meet could not ban users).</p>
			<p>Once a Google<a id="_idIndexMarker497"/> Meet link is generated, the <strong class="bold">Class Settings</strong>, shown here, will have a <strong class="bold">Meet</strong> section that includes a drop-down menu to <strong class="bold">Copy</strong> or <strong class="bold">Reset</strong> the Meet link and a switch to hide the Meet link from the students:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.6_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.6 – Meet settings in the class settings&#13;&#10;" width="558" height="151"/>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.6 – Meet settings in the class settings</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-131"><a id="_idTextAnchor131"/>Getting started with Google Meet</h1>
			<p>There are <a id="_idIndexMarker498"/>many variables that affect the quality of online teaching. The next chapter, <em class="italic">Chapter 11</em>, <em class="italic">Strategies for a Successful Online Class</em>, will go through some of the concepts beyond Google Meet that contribute to online teaching. Regardless, each meeting generally requires settings for audio, video, and conference controls.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-132"><a id="_idTextAnchor132"/>Google Meet audio and video settings</h2>
			<p>When<a id="_idIndexMarker499"/> joining a meeting from devices with built-in cameras and <a id="_idIndexMarker500"/>microphones such as laptops, Chromebooks, or mobile devices, Google Meet will detect and select the integrated hardware. However, desktop computers may require microphone, speaker, and webcam peripherals before being able to use Google Meet effectively.</p>
			<p>In fact, many laptop and Chromebook setups use peripheral devices, often connected through USB, to enhance the video conferencing experience. Because most of these peripherals relate to a desktop or laptop environment, these instructions will focus on those devices. To adjust audio and video settings, use the following instructions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In Classroom, click on the <strong class="bold">Meet link</strong> in the banner.<p class="callout-heading">Being first to the meeting</p><p class="callout">Administrators can disable Google Meet creation for student accounts within Google Workspace for Education. Therefore, it is important to start the meeting a few minutes before the start of class so that students can join on time. If a student tries to create a meeting, they will be taken to a page that says they cannot create a meeting.</p><p>If this is your first time launching Google Meet, a dialog box from the web browser will ask for permission to access the computer's audio and video devices.</p></li>
				<li>In the Google Meet lobby, click the <strong class="bold">Check your audio and video</strong> button below the preview window:<div><img src="img/Figure_10.7_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.7 – The Check your audio and video button&#13;&#10;" width="1208" height="600"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.7 – The Check your audio and video button</p></li>
				<li>A dialog<a id="_idIndexMarker501"/> box will appear with drop-down menus for<a id="_idIndexMarker502"/> the microphone, speaker, and camera. Once the desired devices are selected, click on the <strong class="bold">Next</strong> button:<div><img src="img/Figure_10.8_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.8 – Audio and video devices dialog box&#13;&#10;" width="485" height="439"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.8 – Audio and video devices dialog box</p><p class="callout-heading">Tip</p><p class="callout">Whenever <a id="_idIndexMarker503"/>possible, select a microphone and speaker source from the <a id="_idIndexMarker504"/>same device to reduce audible echoes and feedback. For example, select both the microphone and speakers of a headset.</p></li>
				<li>The dialog box will offer to record a short clip so that you can review the settings. Click on the <strong class="bold">Start</strong> button to begin recording or click on the <strong class="bold">X</strong> in the top right to exit:<div><img src="img/Figure_10.9_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.9 – Testing audio and video device settings&#13;&#10;" width="550" height="495"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.9 – Testing audio and video device settings</p></li>
				<li>Optionally, click <a id="_idIndexMarker505"/>on the <strong class="bold">Change Background</strong> button to <a id="_idIndexMarker506"/>adjust the webcam background. The webcam preview will expand with options to blur the background to give the webcam a more cinematic look or to replace the background with an image:<div><img src="img/Figure_10.10_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.10 – Video background settings&#13;&#10;" width="551" height="438"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.10 – Video background settings</p><p>The <strong class="bold">Change Background</strong> feature <a id="_idIndexMarker507"/>is quite demanding for the<a id="_idIndexMarker508"/> computer.

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.11 – The Join now button in the Meet lobby</p>
			<p>Many of the settings <a id="_idIndexMarker509"/>shown here are <em class="italic">remembered</em> in Google Meet <a id="_idIndexMarker510"/>so that you do not need to repeat device selection or change background settings with each meeting on the same device.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important</p>
			<p class="callout">Some features, such as <strong class="bold">Change Background</strong>, are not available on a mobile device.</p>
			<h3>Additional Google Meet lobby settings</h3>
			<p>While the steps<a id="_idIndexMarker511"/> in the previous section outline the most common method of joining a meeting, there are additional settings in the Google Meet lobby for specific purposes:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.12_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.12 – Meet lobby settings&#13;&#10;" width="1192" height="489"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.12 – Meet lobby settings</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">Audio and Video mute</strong>: Before entering the meeting, users have the option to mute their microphone or camera.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Join with a phone</strong>: Allows users who have unreliable internet connections to join the <a id="_idIndexMarker512"/>meeting, audio-only, with a phone.<p class="callout-heading">Important</p><p class="callout">Be cautious when using the <strong class="bold">Join with a phone</strong> feature as long-distance charges can apply. Some school districts disable this feature altogether.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cast this meeting</strong>: Allows the video and audio from the conference to be viewed on a Google Chromecast-enabled device. This feature is great for allowing a small group of people to see the meeting but still have the microphone close to the speaker.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Present to Google Meet</strong>: Allows the presentation of content on the device (that is, a program) without any other interactivity. This feature allows a higher-quality video presentation to others in the meeting and allows viewers to hear the computer audio. This feature is often used in conjunction with a second device also in the meeting to interact with viewers of the meeting. The primary function of this feature is to reduce the video lag of the presentation.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Kebab menu</strong>: While many of the options within this menu have moved to the general interface, such as <strong class="bold">Change Background</strong> and <strong class="bold">Select audio and video devices</strong>, it also contains options such as <strong class="bold">Enable an in-house live stream</strong>, <strong class="bold">Turn on captions</strong>, <strong class="bold">Report problems or abuse</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Change the video resolution of incoming and outgoing video streams</strong>.<p class="callout-heading">In-house live streams</p><p class="callout">Google Meet only supports up to 250 users within a single meeting. However, there are instances where a <a id="_idIndexMarker513"/>meeting may be broadcasted to a large group of viewers. In-house live streams allow up to 100,000 viewers to view the meeting. Viewers are not the same as participants because they cannot interact with the chat or other features of the meeting. It generates a separate URL for viewers to join.</p></li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-133"><a id="_idTextAnchor133"/>Google Meet conference controls</h2>
			<p>Upon joining <a id="_idIndexMarker514"/>a meeting, there are a plethora of buttons visible. The following figure will guide you briefly around the Google Meet interface. Some of these features will be expanded upon later in this section:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.13_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.13 – Google Meet toolbars&#13;&#10;" width="1297" height="817"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.13 – Google Meet toolbars</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">Meeting info dialog box</strong>: As the creator of the meeting, this dialog box will appear with <a id="_idIndexMarker515"/>the Google Meet information and options to invite others to the meeting. Subsequent participants entering the meeting will not see this dialog box.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Microphone controls</strong>: Mute or unmute the microphone.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Camera controls</strong>: Turn the camera on or off.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Enable Real-Time Captions</strong>: Google Meet will display real-time captions in English, French, German, Portuguese, or Spanish.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Raise hand</strong>: Turn on a visual indicator to others in the meeting that you have something to say.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Present now</strong>: Presents a tab from a web browser, a program window, or an entire desktop screen to other participants and viewers of the meeting.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Kebab menu</strong>: Additional options including casting the meeting, opening a digital whiteboard, starting/stopping recording the meeting, changing the layout, changing the background, changing the audio and video devices, and so on.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">End call</strong>: Leave the meeting. The host can also end the meeting for all participants.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Meeting Info</strong>: Contains the same information as the dialog box in (<strong class="bold">1</strong>).</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Show everyone</strong>: View a list of all participants. The host of the meeting can pin participant cameras, mute<a id="_idIndexMarker516"/> microphones, and eject participants from the meeting.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Chat with everyone</strong>: View and send chat messages to all participants.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Activities</strong>: Enhanced features such as breakout rooms, polls, and Q&amp;As.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Meeting safety</strong>: A common host setting to manage who can enter the meeting and who can share their screen or send chat messages.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Protecting the meeting with host controls</h3>
			<p>If you are the<a id="_idIndexMarker517"/> creator of a meeting, the <strong class="bold">Meeting safety</strong> shield icon will appear. When the COVID-19 pandemic began, this shield icon, and the settings within, didn't exist. All over social media, stories of students <em class="italic">Zoom-bombing</em> meeting, sharing inappropriate images, and distracting everyone with irrelevant conversations in the chat abounded as common online teaching nightmare stories spread around teacher communities.</p>
			<p>As time progressed, host controls, through the <strong class="bold">Meeting safety</strong> icon (and <strong class="bold">Meet Settings</strong>), gave teachers more control of the online classroom. Hosts are able to disable screen sharing (explored later in the chapter) and the chat box for participants as well as requiring all participants to ask the host to join before being admitted to the meeting. A screenshot of all the switches under <strong class="bold">Meeting safety</strong> is shown in the following figure:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.14_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.14 – Meeting safety settings&#13;&#10;" width="362" height="532"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.14 – Meeting safety settings</p>
			<p>When <strong class="bold">Quick access</strong> is <a id="_idIndexMarker518"/>disabled, potential participants will see a button saying <strong class="bold">Ask to join</strong> instead of <strong class="bold">Join now</strong>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.15_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.15 – The Ask to join button in the Meet lobby&#13; &#10;" width="312" height="183"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.15 – The Ask to join button in the Meet lobby</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Who is the host of a meeting?</p>
			<p class="callout">The meeting creator is the host of the meeting. At the time of writing, there is no way to transfer host controls to another participant or add co-hosts. In Google Workspace for Education, certain user groups, such as teachers, can be set at the administrator level so that anyone within that group can have host controls in a meeting. In many school divisions, students are not able to create their own meetings so that a student doesn't accidentally have host controls over a meeting that a teacher is leading. Other terms for the host include the meeting creator or organizer.</p>
			<p>Other strategies Google Meet uses to protect the meeting include preventing a user from continuously asking to join a meeting (try staying focused on teaching when there is a notification every few seconds from the same unknown person asking to join). After two <a id="_idIndexMarker519"/>unanswered requests, all further requests are muted.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Using meeting safety with attendance</p>
			<p class="callout">Not all tiers of Google Workspace for Education will send a spreadsheet containing Google Meet attendance data to the teacher. Furthermore, your <strong class="bold">Student Information System</strong> (<strong class="bold">SIS</strong>) may require attendance to be taken at the beginning of the class instead of at the end. In these situations, you can start the meeting with <strong class="bold">Quick Access</strong> enabled, then disable it after the attendance so that you don't miss it if someone enters the meeting late.</p>
			<p>The final protection Google implements in Google Meet is removing current participants. To better protect the meeting, any participants removed from a meeting cannot re-enter unless the host manually invites the participant back into the meeting. This feature, in conjunction with the Meet Link discussed earlier, means that a participant can be removed from the Google Classroom-generated meeting for that meeting, but will be automatically admitted to the next meeting.</p>
			<p>In the next section, there are instructions for removing and inviting participants to the meeting.</p>
			<h3>Managing participants in a meeting</h3>
			<p>As the host of <a id="_idIndexMarker520"/>the meeting, you are able to invite, mute the audio of, and remove students (and other participants) from a meeting. All the settings are found in the <strong class="bold">People</strong> sidebar, which appears by clicking the <strong class="bold">Show everyone</strong> button:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.16_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.16 – The Show everyone button in the top toolbar&#13;&#10;" width="352" height="151"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.16 – The Show everyone button in the top toolbar</p>
			<p>You get an alphabetical list of all participants in the call will be visible. Beside each participant is a microphone indicator and a drop-down menu with options to pin the participant to the screen or remove the participant from the meeting. An image of the sidebar is shown here:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.17_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.17 – People sidebar&#13;&#10;" width="269" height="373"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.17 – People sidebar</p>
			<p>The top of the <strong class="bold">People</strong> sidebar has buttons to mute everyone (except the host); add people to the <a id="_idIndexMarker521"/>meeting, which is also how to re-add a participant that has been removed from the meeting; and the host controls, which has the same settings as the <strong class="bold">Meeting safety </strong>icon.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Pin a participant</p>
			<p class="callout">Pinning a participant fills the entire Google Meet window with the participant's webcam. A user cannot pin a participant for someone else. There are many applications for this feature, from ensuring that the speaker is visible in an online/in-person hybrid class and scrutinizing a webcam during a summative assessment, to displaying the correct webcam feed when a teacher is joining the meeting multiple times to have separate webcams.</p>
			<h3>Webcam tile settings</h3>
			<p>When <a id="_idIndexMarker522"/>hovering the mouse over a participant's webcam tile, buttons for pinning (<strong class="bold">A</strong>), muting (<strong class="bold">B</strong>), and removing the participant (<strong class="bold">C</strong>) will appear over the tile, shown here:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.18_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.18 – Participant tile settings&#13;&#10;" width="372" height="164"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.18 – Participant tile settings</p>
			<p>When hovering the mouse over your own webcam tile, some buttons are different. There is pinning the tile (<strong class="bold">A</strong>), removing the tile from the layout (<strong class="bold">B</strong>), and minimizing the tile (<strong class="bold">C</strong>):</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.19_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.19 – Current user's webcam tile settings&#13;&#10;" width="366" height="167"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">  </p>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.19 – Current user's webcam tile settings</p>
			<p>Removing your tile from the layout places a smaller preview tile. This tile can be dragged to any corner in the meeting. An example of the layout is shown here:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.20_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.20 – Preview tile of the current user's webcam and mic&#13;&#10;" width="565" height="257"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.20 – Preview tile of the current user's webcam and mic</p>
			<p>When minimizing<a id="_idIndexMarker523"/> your tile, it will collapse into a toolbar, which can also be moved to any corner.</p>
			<p>Now that students (and other participants) are visible in the meeting, the next section explores how to interact with meeting members through more than lecturing into your webcam.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-134"><a id="_idTextAnchor134"/>Engaging students within Google Meet</h1>
			<p>As students<a id="_idIndexMarker524"/> join, Google Meet will choose a layout that automatically shows up to nine participants until you switch to a sidebar layout, where the currently speaking participant is shown. However, you can customize the layout between <strong class="bold">Auto</strong>, <strong class="bold">Tiled</strong>, <strong class="bold">Spotlight</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Sidebar</strong>. Google Meet will save your preferences for subsequent meetings. </p>
			<p>To change the Meet layout, use the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Click on the kebab menu and select <strong class="bold">Change layout</strong>:<div><img src="img/Figure_10.21_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.21 – Change layout option in the kebab menu&#13;&#10;" width="407" height="521"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.21 – Change layout option in the kebab menu</p></li>
				<li>Click<a id="_idIndexMarker525"/> the radio button of the desired layout:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.22_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.22 – Change layout dialog box&#13;&#10;" width="322" height="372"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.22 – Change layout dialog box</p>
			<p>In the <strong class="bold">Change layout</strong> menu, you can adjust the number of participants to display on the<a id="_idIndexMarker526"/> screen. Whenever there are more participants than the maximum tiles to display, only the most recent tiles who spoke during the meeting will be visible. When managing my online classes, I change this setting to the highest possible number so that I can see all my students.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important</p>
			<p class="callout">Many students will choose to turn off their cameras when possible. Considerations for online classroom expectations are discussed in the final chapter, <em class="italic">Chapter 11</em>, <em class="italic">Strategies for a Successful Online Class</em>. When a student's camera is off, their account's profile picture will replace the camera view in the tile.</p>
			<p>Now that I can see all my students, there are two ways they can communicate – verbally through their computer microphone and through the chat. Similar to an in-person class, there are few instances where students can call out during a lesson. Before a student asks a question verbally, they can use the <em class="italic">Raise hand</em> feature, which will display an indicator in the student's webcam, and a <strong class="bold">RAISED HANDS</strong> section will appear in the sidebar, shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.23_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.23 – RAISED HANDS section in the People tab&#13;&#10;" width="1279" height="726"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.23 – RAISED HANDS section in the People tab</p>
			<p>Once the <a id="_idIndexMarker527"/>student is done talking, they can lower their hand or the host of the meeting can do it in the <strong class="bold">RAISED HANDS</strong> section.</p>
			<p>The chat is enabled by default and allows all users to communicate with each other. At the time of writing, there is no way to chat with a specific participant; however, the <strong class="bold">Q&amp;A</strong> feature in the <strong class="bold">Activities</strong> section can allow students to ask questions to the meeting host directly. To open the chat, click on the <strong class="bold">Chat with everyone</strong> icon in the meeting, or, if the sidebar is already open, the icon at the top of the sidebar, indicated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.24_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.24 – Chat tab in the sidebar&#13;&#10;" width="340" height="505"/>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.24 – Chat tab in the sidebar</p>
			<p>The preceding<a id="_idIndexMarker528"/> screenshot also shows the switch to disable the chat and the text field at the bottom to send the chat.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Emojis in the chat 😮🎉🎉😎</p>
			<p class="callout">Showing students how to insert emojis into the chat is a great way to convey emotion within the chat. To bring up the emoji menu, click on the chat's text field and then use the keyboard shortcut <em class="italic">⊞</em>+ <em class="italic">.</em> for Windows or <em class="italic">⌘</em> + <em class="italic">Alt</em> + <em class="italic">Space</em> for macOS; or you can right-click on the text field and select emojis in the context menu for ChromeOS.</p>
			<p>With the basics of seeing and communicating with participants set, there are many times where<a id="_idIndexMarker529"/> seeing the teacher's face is not enough.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-135"><a id="_idTextAnchor135"/>Presenting a screen to students</h2>
			<p>There are <a id="_idIndexMarker530"/>several different ways of presenting a screen for Google Meet participants. Before going through the variations, be conscious of the quality of the content you are presenting. For example, when presenting a screen with a document, the font size may be adequate for you to read but may be too small for other participants.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, certain methods of presenting in Google Meet may distort or desync the audio and video (or omit the audio altogether). Consider sharing some of these resources in Google Classroom ahead of time instead of solely relying on the present screen feature to disseminate information to students and other participants.</p>
			<p>Presenting the computer screen, program window or Chrome tab uses the <strong class="bold">Present </strong>button within the meeting. A menu will appear to select whether the entire screen, a program window, or a browser tab will be presented, shown here:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.25_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.25 – Present menu&#13;&#10;" width="436" height="405"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.25 – Present menu</p>
			<p>Each option has advantages and disadvantages when presenting content to Google Meet participants.</p>
			<h3>Presenting a computer screen or program window</h3>
			<p>Presenting a<a id="_idIndexMarker531"/> computer screen and<a id="_idIndexMarker532"/> presenting a program window are functionally the same. When your entire screen is selected, the following dialog box requires you to select the screen:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.26_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.26 – Share your entire screen dialog box&#13;&#10;" width="617" height="445"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.26 – Share your entire screen dialog box</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Even if your computer only has one screen, you will still need to select the screen before clicking on the <strong class="bold">Share</strong> button.</p>
			<p>On the other hand, presenting a program window will have a popup to select the individual window:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.27_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.27 – Share an application window dialog box&#13;&#10;" width="594" height="304"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.27 – Share an application window dialog box</p>
			<p>When presenting, a window will appear in Google Meet displaying the content:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.28_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.28 – Present window in the meeting layout&#13;&#10;" width="1266" height="769"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.28 – Present window in the meeting layout</p>
			<p>At the bottom<a id="_idIndexMarker533"/> of the screen, there will <a id="_idIndexMarker534"/>also be a small banner indicating that the screen or window is being presented:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.29_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.29 – Banner notification at the bottom of the operating system desktop&#13;&#10;" width="414" height="58"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.29 – Banner notification at the bottom of the operating system desktop</p>
			<p>Presenting a computer screen is easier to manage because whatever the presenter sees on the screen is the same as what the participants of the meeting also see. However, it is also the least secure since computer notifications or window switching can display sensitive information to participants. There are several stories I have heard of teachers forgetting that they are presenting a screen and checking their emails or recording marks with the entire class watching.</p>
			<p>Presenting a window only solves this problem, but it is more cumbersome if the presenter is using multiple different programs. Whenever the presenter wants to change program windows, they will need to stop presenting the current window and then present the new window. Whether to present the entire screen or a window depends on the presenter's preference of managing windows and security. Neither presenting an entire screen nor presenting a window shares the desktop audio.</p>
			<p>Thus, if you present a video through a program like Windows Media Player, the participants <a id="_idIndexMarker535"/>will not be able to hear<a id="_idIndexMarker536"/> the audio. To play audio or video for participants, the presenter will need to present a browser tab.</p>
			<h3>Presenting a Google Chrome tab</h3>
			<p>As stated <a id="_idIndexMarker537"/>in the <strong class="bold">Present</strong> menu, presenting<a id="_idIndexMarker538"/> <strong class="bold">A tab</strong> is best for video and animation:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.30_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.30 – Presenting a tab&#13;&#10;" width="313" height="233"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.30 – Presenting a tab</p>
			<p>Whether you're using YouTube or Spotify, this form of presentation will focus on reducing lag. It is also easier to switch between tabs using this method. Each tab in the browser will include a heading to stop presenting the tab or to switch from the presented tab to your current one:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.31_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.31 – Tab presentation settings toolbar&#13;&#10;" width="569" height="133"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.31 – Tab presentation settings toolbar</p>
			<p>If the majority of your teaching tools are from Google Workspace for Education apps, websites, and online apps, this method will work the best.</p>
			<p>Google Chrome is more than a web browser. You can use Google Chrome to play video and audio files. Chrome will natively play <code>webm</code>, <code>mp4</code>, and <code>ogg</code> video formats and <code>wav</code>, <code>mp3</code>, and <code>acc</code> audio files. To play any of these files in Chrome, drag and drop the file onto Google<a id="_idIndexMarker539"/> Chrome and a media <a id="_idIndexMarker540"/>player will open in a new tab:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.32_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.32 – Opening a video or audio file in Google Chrome&#13;&#10;" width="624" height="390"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.32 – Opening a video or audio file in Google Chrome</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Converting video and audio files</p>
			<p class="callout">There are many programs and online tools to convert video and audio files from one format to another. Windows Media Player and Apple iTunes can convert audio CDs to <code>mp3</code> formats and the program, Handbrake, can transcode a video to <code>mp4</code>.</p>
			<p>By presenting content within the meeting, participants can easily follow presentations, documents, and other content. However, the mental tedium of deciding which form of presenting for which type of content can be draining on the presenter. Another possible alternative can simplify the presentation process.</p>
			<h3>Only present to the meeting</h3>
			<p>Google Meet<a id="_idIndexMarker541"/> has the option to only present to a meeting. Within the lobby there is an option to present:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.33_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.33 – Present button in the Meet lobby&#13;&#10;" width="346" height="246"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.33 – Present button in the Meet lobby</p>
			<p>Clicking on this option brings up a menu to present a tab, the entire screen, or a program application window. In this mode, selecting <strong class="bold">Chrome Tab</strong> or <strong class="bold">Your Entire Screen </strong>will share<a id="_idIndexMarker542"/> the desktop audio:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.34_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.34 – Share audio checkbox when presenting&#13;&#10;" width="743" height="577"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.34 – Share audio checkbox when presenting</p>
			<p>Because this mode only presents, it does not interact with the meeting participants. Presenting content to the meeting in this fashion only sends the presented content to the meeting. It doesn't receive anything. Therefore, the sent content often has higher video and audio quality.</p>
			<p>For the presenter to interact with the participants, they will need to join the meeting with a separate device. This setup requires two devices, but it can be easier to manage because one device is only for presenting content and the other is only for interacting with the participants. In my classroom, my setup includes a Windows desktop computer, which presents content, and then a Chromebook, which is how I interact with my students.</p>
			<p>The Windows computer always has a screen presented so that I don't have to worry about whether audio is being properly sent, and then I have the Chromebook, with a built-in<a id="_idIndexMarker543"/> microphone and webcam, for the face-to-face interaction (my setup also has a third computer, but that one will be explained in the next section). When using a lot of media content, having two separate devices is invaluable to ensure a smooth online teaching and learning experience.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-136"><a id="_idTextAnchor136"/>Writing on a Jamboard</h2>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker544"/> instructions for presenting your screen from <a id="_idIndexMarker545"/>the previous section work well for Google Slides and other presentation software; however, there are many instances where you may want to draw on your screen. Google's Jamboard is an online whiteboard where you can draw, add sticky notes, and add images. Others can also collaborate on the Jamboard to add their own content too. To create a Jamboard, click on the kebab menu and select <strong class="bold">Whiteboard</strong>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.35_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.35 – Whiteboard option in the kebab menu&#13;&#10;" width="242" height="451"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.35 – Whiteboard option in the kebab menu</p>
			<p>A dialog box <a id="_idIndexMarker546"/>will appear asking whether to <a id="_idIndexMarker547"/>create a blank Jamboard or use one that's already saved in your Google Drive. After opening the Jamboard, all features are found in the left panel, shown here:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.36_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.36 – Jamboard features&#13;&#10;" width="640" height="378"/>

			</ol>
			<p>For students to<a id="_idIndexMarker548"/> see the Jamboard, it needs to be <a id="_idIndexMarker549"/>presented in the meeting, or students can click on a link sent to their inbox. Once created, the Jamboard file is available in Google Drive. By presenting your screen and using Jamboards, you can now share a wide range of content to your students. These features <a id="_idIndexMarker550"/>are<a id="_idIndexMarker551"/> available for any Google account.</p>
			<p>The next section will explore additional features available to Google Workspace for Education accounts.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-137"><a id="_idTextAnchor137"/>Enhanced engagement features</h2>
			<p>Only the <a id="_idIndexMarker552"/>higher editions of Google Workspace for Education and Google Workspace for Business include the following features. Personal Gmail accounts do not have these features. These enhanced features are <strong class="bold">Breakout rooms</strong>, <strong class="bold">Polls</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Q&amp;A</strong>, and are found in the <strong class="bold">Activities</strong> button in the bottom bar:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.37_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.37 – Activities button in the Meet sidebar&#13;&#10;" width="332" height="374"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.37 – Activities button in the Meet sidebar</p>
			<p>Before diving into each of these features, not all are available on mobile apps. Therefore, before using these features heavily, ensure that all your students are using a Windows, macOS, or ChromeOS computer rather than the iOS and Android apps.</p>
			<h3>Splitting up participants into smaller groups with breakout rooms</h3>
			<p><strong class="bold">Breakout rooms</strong> allow<a id="_idIndexMarker553"/> students and other participants to <a id="_idIndexMarker554"/>separate into separate meetings. This feature is great for group work and collaboration. These individual meetings are overseen by the teacher, who can move students from one meeting to another, join individual meetings, and end all the breakout rooms.</p>
			<p>To set up breakout rooms, use the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Click on <strong class="bold">Breakout rooms</strong> in the <strong class="bold">Activities</strong> menu:<div><img src="img/Figure_10.38_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.38 – Breakout rooms option in the Activities menu&#13;&#10;" width="332" height="363"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.38 – Breakout rooms option in the Activities menu</p></li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Set up breakout rooms</strong> button:<div><img src="img/Figure_10.39_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.39 – Set up breakout rooms button&#13;&#10;" width="349" height="347"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.39 – Set up breakout rooms button</p></li>
				<li>Google<a id="_idIndexMarker555"/> Meet <a id="_idIndexMarker556"/>will automatically create multiple rooms and randomly send all participants into those rooms. Click on the <strong class="bold">Open rooms</strong> button at the bottom of the sidebar:<div><img src="img/Figure_10.40_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.40 – Breakout rooms settings&#13;&#10;" width="372" height="754"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.40 – Breakout rooms settings</p></li>
				<li>Participants<a id="_idIndexMarker557"/> will<a id="_idIndexMarker558"/> receive a popup asking them to join their respective rooms:<div><img src="img/Figure_10.41_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.41 – Breakout room notification for participants&#13;&#10;" width="315" height="135"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.41 – Breakout room notification for participants</p><p>Before opening rooms, you can change the number of rooms and rearrange students<a id="_idIndexMarker559"/> by dragging and dropping them into a <a id="_idIndexMarker560"/>breakout room. Another method of moving students is to type their name in the breakout room you want to move them into. The buttons at the top of the sidebar also allow you to set a timer that will appear in each breakout room, reshuffle all participants in the breakout rooms, or clear all the breakout rooms.</p></li>
				<li>Once the breakout rooms are in session, you will be able to edit the breakout rooms, close the rooms, and join any room:</li>
			</ol>

			<p class="callout">Not every student needs to be in a breakout room. Often, after a lesson, I will invite students into breakout rooms who request one-on-one support. The rest of the class would then remain in the main meeting.</p>
			<p>At the top <a id="_idIndexMarker561"/>of each <a id="_idIndexMarker562"/>breakout room, there is a banner with links to <strong class="bold">Ask for help</strong> from the teacher or organizer and <strong class="bold">Return to the main call</strong>:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.44 – Breakout room banner with a warning countdown</p>
			<p>A dialog box will appear to redirect participants back to the main meeting. The teacher can press the <strong class="bold">Close rooms</strong> button a second time to immediately close the breakout rooms without waiting for the 30-second countdown to complete.</p>
			<h3>Use polls for voting and immediate feedback</h3>
			<p>Polls allow <a id="_idIndexMarker563"/>you to ask<a id="_idIndexMarker564"/> multiple-choice questions quickly during the meeting. Often, I use this feature to perform formative assessments. Creating a poll involves the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In the <strong class="bold">Activities</strong> menu, click on the <strong class="bold">Polls</strong> feature:<div><img src="img/Figure_10.45_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.45 – Polls option in the Activities menu&#13;&#10;" width="412" height="419"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.45 – Polls option in the Activities menu</p></li>

				<li>Fill out the question stem and options. Then click the <strong class="bold">Launch</strong> button. To create the poll in advance, click on the <strong class="bold">Save</strong> button. The poll will stay in the menu and will not be visible to meeting participants until the <strong class="bold">Launch</strong> button is pressed:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.47_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.47 – Poll question stem, options, and Save button&#13;&#10;" width="428" height="519"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.47 – Poll question stem, options, and Save button</p>
			<p>Participants<a id="_idIndexMarker567"/> will <a id="_idIndexMarker568"/>see an indicator on the <strong class="bold">Activities</strong> tab that there is a new poll:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.48_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.48 – New activity indicator&#13;&#10;" width="325" height="133"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.48 – New activity indicator</p>
			<p>They will be able to click on a selection and submit using the <strong class="bold">Vote</strong> button:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.49_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.49 – Answering a poll&#13;&#10;" width="526" height="442"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.49 – Answering a poll</p>
			<p>As the meeting organizer, you will be able to see the results and can choose to show the results to the participants. An example of when I show my students the results of a poll is when I <a id="_idIndexMarker569"/>let them choose<a id="_idIndexMarker570"/> when to have a unit exam. While you will be able to see who voted for what, displaying the poll results does not display which students voted for which selection. It only displays the final tally.</p>
			<h3>Keeping questions in one place with Q&amp;A</h3>
			<p>While<a id="_idIndexMarker571"/> the chat feature is available in all meetings, an overly active chat can drown out questions. The <strong class="bold">Q&amp;A</strong> feature keeps all the questions in one place. <strong class="bold">Q&amp;A</strong> must be turned on before participants can as questions. To turn on this feature, click the <strong class="bold">Q&amp;A</strong> section of the <strong class="bold">Activities</strong> tab:</p>
			<p class="figure-caption"><img src="img/Figure_10.50_B16846.png" alt="Figure 10.50 – Q&amp;A option in the Activities tab&#13;&#10;" width="347" height="381"/></p>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.50 – Q&amp;A option in the Activities tab</p>
			<p>There will be a <strong class="bold">Turn on Q&amp;A</strong> button to enable this feature. Then, all meeting participants <a id="_idIndexMarker572"/>can ask questions by clicking on the <strong class="bold">+ Ask a question</strong> button and filling out the question field in this menu:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.51_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.51 – The + Ask a question button in the Q&amp;A menu&#13;&#10;" width="339" height="370"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.51 – The + Ask a question button in the Q&amp;A menu</p>
			<p>When questions are asked, other participants can upvote the question by clicking on the thumbs-up icon. <em class="italic">Figure 10.51</em> shows a post with two upvotes. Each participant can choose to view all questions or only their questions or order the questions by oldest, newest, or most upvoted questions. Instead of viewing their own questions, the hosts can sort <a id="_idIndexMarker573"/>by <strong class="bold">All questions</strong>, <strong class="bold">Unanswered</strong>, <strong class="bold">Answered</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Hidden</strong>, as shown here:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.52_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.52 – Sorting and filtering questions options&#13;&#10;" width="356" height="331"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.52 – Sorting and filtering questions options</p>
			<p>As the organizer, teachers will also be able to mark questions as hidden, so all other participants will no longer see the question; mark questions as answered; and delete questions:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.53_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.53 – Host controls settings for questions&#13;&#10;" width="387" height="349"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.53 – Host controls settings for questions</p>
			<p>Organizers are also able to sort questions by <strong class="bold">Unanswered</strong>, <strong class="bold">Answered</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Hidden</strong>. Often, when <a id="_idIndexMarker574"/>I am done answering a question, I will mark it answered and mark it hidden. Then the student in question will be able to see that I have addressed the question, but other students will no longer see the question in the question list. I particularly enjoy using this feature to track participation and see whether a student is asking to use the restroom frequently.</p>
			<p>With all these methods of engaging with students, when someone isn't there, they can miss out on a great online learning environment. For students who are absent, one possible solution for them to authentically experience the lesson is to record the meeting.</p>
			<p>But before clicking the record button, the next section explores some necessary information and decision-making factors to consider to avoid potential problems.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-138"><a id="_idTextAnchor138"/>Considerations when recording meetings</h1>
			<p>While in<a id="_idIndexMarker575"/> a meeting, the kebab menu has a <strong class="bold">Record Meeting</strong> button:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.54_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 10.54 – Record meeting option in the kebab menu&#13;&#10;" width="228" height="424"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 10.54 – Record meeting option in the kebab menu</p>
			<p>In Google<a id="_idIndexMarker576"/> Workspace with Education, only non-students can start a recording. (However, in business versions of Google Workspace, anyone can start a recording.) When a meeting is recorded, an <code>mp4</code> video file will be added to the meeting creator's Google Drive and shared with whoever started the recording. Google Chat text is also recorded as a separate file when recording is enabled. Only the portion of the meeting for which recording was turned on will be saved. Participants outside the organization will receive a notification that the meeting is being recorded.</p>
			<p>When recording a meeting, the active speaker and anything being presented is recorded. The recording will also include the active speaker's first and last names. Because there is a large amount of sensitive information being saved, consider some of the following questions. Some of you may need to consult with various departments within your school district.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-139"><a id="_idTextAnchor139"/>How does this recording reflect on me?</h2>
			<p>When sharing video files, there is little protection to prevent the video from being further published in a public space, such as social media. Therefore, remember that content, whether curricular or tangential, may reflect negatively on your pedagogy and can be used as evidence against your teaching practices. This fear is often enough to deter many teachers from recording meetings.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-140"><a id="_idTextAnchor140"/>What are your school division's policies?</h2>
			<p>Be sure that you ensure that recording meetings with students is permissible. Google Meet recordings have lots of identifying footage of students, their names, and where they are joining your class from. During the COVID-19 pandemic, online teaching surged. One of the unintended outcomes was how much teachers became aware of their students' home situations.</p>
			<p>The internet was<a id="_idIndexMarker577"/> filled with stories of teachers recording student screens where the scene behind the student included inappropriately dressed parents, family members using illicit materials, or students sitting in the street to use someone else's Wi-Fi. Needless to say, recording student webcams can cause unintended complications for the teacher when something unexpected happens on a student's camera.</p>
			<p>Because of these possible outcomes, when online teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic began, my school division communicated a strict <em class="italic">no recording of students</em> policy for all teachers.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-141"><a id="_idTextAnchor141"/>Does the recording have to be live?</h2>
			<p>While this entire chapter frames using Google Meet with students and other participants within the meeting, a recording can be made with only the organizer. The organizer can still share their screen to present slides and other supplementary content. The added benefit of recording meetings with only the teacher is that the same video can be used for multiple classes.</p>
			<p>One disadvantage is that this recording must be made prior to the class time, which means more work. However, the benefit of having videos of the lessons for absent students may outweigh the additional work to first create the videos. Students who are present may even watch the pre-recorded videos again to clarify their understanding of parts of the lesson. From a personal perspective, I have been recording course lessons since 2014 and<a id="_idIndexMarker578"/> have found them invaluable to my pedagogy.</p>

			<p>Google Meet elevates Google Classroom beyond the brick-and-mortar classroom. With its integration with Classroom, ability to present content, and engagement tools, teachers can offer an active and engaging online learning experience for students of all ages. While Google continues to add features and refine Google Meet, this chapter explored all the features available at the time of writing. If there was a feature that you did not see, double-check whether your account has access to that feature. </p>
			<p>Furthermore, user interface changes are still common with this app because the COVID-19 pandemic substantially sped up its development timeline. In fact, the entire chapter had to be revised because of recent interface changes. Also, the following figure suggests that the <strong class="bold">Whiteboarding</strong> and <strong class="bold">Recording</strong> features may move to the <strong class="bold">Activities</strong> tab:</p>

			<p>Therefore, if the app looks different to you, explore the buttons and menus to see what is new.</p>
			<p>Now you can enable and start a Google Meet from Google Classroom, test your microphone and camera, present contents on your screen, use a digital whiteboard, manage students and engage them with breakout rooms, polls, and questions. By the time you read this book, there may be even more features to help teachers manage their online classrooms (come on, assigning hosts to meetings!). Some confirmed upcoming features may already be available, such as pinning multiple users, video feed adjustments, and replacing the background with videos. Despite knowing how Google Meet works, there are still several ideas, concepts, and things to consider that affect the effectiveness of online teaching.</p>
			<p>The next chapter explores some of those strategies so that you can find success teaching online.</p>
