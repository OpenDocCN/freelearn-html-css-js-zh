- en: There was a time when if you wanted to build a web application, you were pretty
    much on your own. You had to start from scratch and figure it all out on your
    own. However, now there are plenty of libraries and frameworks that you can use
    to build amazing web apps that are full of features; Backbone is just one of those
    libraries.
  prefs: []

- en: Backbone is a client-side library that offers models to manage data records,
    collections to use when working with sets of models, and views to display that
    data. Strictly speaking, it's not an MVC library, it's a relatively loose toolbox
    that you can use in many different ways.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is not an introduction to Backbone. We won't be going through every
    feature in the library as if it were a friendly version of the documentation.
    Instead, we'll be looking at Backbone in the context of building an entire web
    application from start to finish. This means that there are a few features of
    Backbone—a few obscure methods or properties—that we won't use at all. If you
    want to learn every nook and cranny of Backbone, you should read the documentation
    at [http://backbonejs.org/](http://backbonejs.org/).

- en: This book has two goals. The first is to teach you how to use Backbone to build
    complete web applications. A complete web application will have a lot more than
    just JavaScript that runs in the browser. There's HTML and CSS to consider, and
    of course, every application needs a server. In each chapter of this book, we'll
    build a different application from scratch, and we'll need to create all these
    components. Of course, these will be applications with heavy client sides, so
    most of the code we will write will use Backbone. However, because we're building
    complete applications, you'll get to see how our Backbone code will work in tandem
    with the rest of the code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other goal of this book is to teach you how Backbone thinks. As we build
    an application, we'll use as many different techniques as we possibly can. While
    there are many Backbone conventions, most of them are not actually necessary for
    your code to work. By learning what is required, you can fulfill those requirements
    and write the rest of your code as you see fit, following convention or not.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Building a Simple Blog"), *Building a Simple
    Blog*, introduces you to each of the main components of Backbone and how they
    work together. If you haven''t used Backbone before, this is important groundwork;
    if you have, this will be your refresher on the purpose of each Backbone piece.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Building a Photo-sharing Application"), *Building
    a Photo-sharing Application*, shows you how to build a photo sharing website similar
    to Instagram. Among other things, you''ll learn how to customize the way Backbone
    models are sent to and received from the server. This is because we''ll be using
    a Backbone model to upload files.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Building a Live Data Dashboard"), *Building
    a Live Data Dashboard*, takes things to the next level by building an application
    that continually polls the server for changes to a dataset, effectively creating
    a *live* application. We''ll also look at better code organization.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Building a Calendar"), *Building a Calendar*,
    will continue the theme of building apps with well-organized code. We''ll also
    learn about properly distributing application functionality.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Building a Chat Application"), *Building
    a Chat Application*, goes in a different direction by using Socket.IO to control
    the transfer of data between the client and the server. Also, we''ll use the Marionette
    framework to make our jobs a little easier.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Building a Podcast Application"), *Building
    a Podcast Application*, shows that not every Backbone application is client-side
    code, some applications will have a lot of server code. We''ll also look at building
    some custom infrastructure to work with Backbone.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Building a Game"), *Building a Game*, wraps
    up the book with a fun project. We''ll review all the main components of Backbone,
    as well as building non-Backbone pages to create a more complete web application.
    Of course, we''ll also have to write the game logic.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since this book is mostly about client-side code, the main tools are a text
    editor and a browser. However, there are a few others you'll need. You'll have
    to install Node.js ([http://nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org)), which comes with
    npm, the Node package manager. If you're on a Mac, that's all you'll need. However,
    if you are on Windows, you'll also want to have a version of Python 2 (preferably
    2.7.3) and Express 2013 for Windows Desktop; you'll need these to install the
    `bcrypt` Node.js package for some of the chapters.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is written for anyone who wants to learn the Backbone library proficiently;
    by building seven very different applications, you'll quickly learn all the ins
    and outs of Backbone. Hopefully, you'll also improve your coding skills, for both
    client and server coding.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, you'll need to know a few things before we get started. You should
    have a decent working knowledge of JavaScript. More nuanced language features
    will be explained in the text, but you should be able to hold your own most of
    the time. Also, all the server code we write will be in Node.js, so you'll want
    to be familiar with that. If you understand that Node.js code is often asynchronous
    and that's why it uses callbacks, you'll be fine. You'll want to be familiar with
    HTML and CSS; while they will not feature heavily, they will have their parts
    to play.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You might wonder if you need to be familiar with Backbone at all to benefit
    from this book. You'll probably be a little more comfortable with it all if you
    understand the basics of Backbone, and what the general purposes of its main components
    are. However, if you've not used it, don't worry. The very first chapter will
    introduce you to all the parts of Backbone by using them in a simple application.
