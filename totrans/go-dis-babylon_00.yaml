- en: The world of 3D application and game development is a vast and actively changing
    landscape. With all the stunning capabilities of modern GPU hardware exposed to
    the web browser via WebGL, AAA-quality interactive rendering can be achieved by
    anyone with some knowledge of JavaScript. Babylon.js is just the right tool to
    use for an effortless experience and a robust application built using WebGL technologies.

- en: Although changes in and the evolution of browser software and hardware standards
    continue at their own pace and on their own schedules, Babylon.js is a framework
    that prioritizes maintaining backward compatibility. Code written for BJS 2.0
    is highly likely to run with little to no modifications in BJS 5.20, so product
    managers and stakeholders can use BJS with confidence about the long-term stability
    of the code.

- en: If Babylon.js is the ticket for WebGL, then this book is your ticket to mastering
    Babylon.js. Well, you probably won’t become a twentieth-level Babylon.js developer
    by the end of this (let’s be real for a moment), but you’ll certainly learn the
    key concepts and techniques that will enable you to progress down that path should
    you so choose!

- en: All of this is starting to become a kind of bad sales pitch, so let’s drop the
    pretense and talk brass tacks. You want or need to learn about 3D game or app
    development. As a human being, you also desire entertainment. This book attempts
    to satisfy both of those needs by avoiding being too boring wherever possible
    while still delivering the big knowledge bombs. Entertainment and enlightenment,
    all in one package.

- en: This book is for artists who avoid coding because they think they’re bad at
    math (give yourself more credit!), game designers whose fingers long to leave
    the spreadsheet, and developers dreaming of worlds yet to be made. This book is
    for students who want to learn outside of their classrooms, teachers who want
    their students to learn inside their classrooms, and parents who want their teenage
    kids to learn something, anything at all.

    with the activities in this book, at least to the point where you are not fazed
    by looking at code that may initially be unfamiliar. Knowing basic 3D concepts
    and terms is also helpful. If you are new to Babylon.js, JavaScript, or 3D development,
    then a fantastic place to start is the Babylon.js start page at [https://doc.babylonjs.com/journey/theFirstStep](https://doc.babylonjs.com/journey/theFirstStep).

    be leveraged in future chapters. Starting with a survey of Space-Truckers and
    Babylon.js, we will construct the main pillars of the game’s hosting application.
    Although a basic understanding of Babylon.js is recommended, the main requirement
    is to have some knowledge of JavaScript or a similar programming language.
