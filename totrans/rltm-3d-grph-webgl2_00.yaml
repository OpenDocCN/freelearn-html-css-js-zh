- en: WebGL is a powerful web technology that brings hardware-accelerated 3D graphics
    to the browser without requiring the user to install additional software. Given
    that WebGL is based on OpenGL and introduces 3D graphics programming to web development,
    it may seem unfamiliar to even experienced web developers. On the other hand,
    for those with experience in traditional computer graphics, building 3D applications
    with JavaScript takes some getting use to. A common view is that JavaScript is
    not as fast as other traditional languages used in computer graphics; although
    this is a concern in comparing CPU-bound algorithms, it is not an issue in comparing
    GPU-bound work. This is where WebGL shines! The powerful capabilities that WebGL
    offers, coupled with the ubiquity and accessibility of browsers, positions the
    technology in a unique and attractive position to power the future of immersive
    experiences on the web.

- en: Packed with many examples, this book shows how WebGL can be easy to learn despite
    its unfriendly appearance. Each chapter addresses one of the important aspects
    of 3D graphics programming and presents different alternatives for its implementation.
    The topics are always associated with exercises that will allow the reader to
    put the concepts to the test.

- en: '*Real-Time 3D Graphics with WebGL 2* presents a clear roadmap to learning WebGL
    2. While WebGL1 is based on the OpenGL ES 2.0 specification, WebGL 2 is derived
    from OpenGL ES 3.0, which guarantees the availability of many WebGL1 extensions
    along with new features. Each chapter starts with a summary of the learning goals
    for the chapter, followed by a detailed description of each topic. The book offers
    example-rich, up-to-date introductions to a wide range of essential WebGL topics,
    including drawing, color, texture, transformations, frame buffers, light, surfaces,
    geometry, and more. Each chapter is packed with useful and practical examples
    that demonstrate the implementation of these topics in a WebGL scene. With each
    chapter, you will "level up" your 3D graphics programming skills. This book will
    become your trustworthy companion, filled with the information required to develop
    compelling 3D web applications with JavaScript and WebGL 2.'

- en: '[Chapter 1](48a27fb2-f17b-43b2-8706-ab638a32b7ff.xhtml), *Getting Started*,
    introduces the HTML5 `canvas` element and describes how to obtain a WebGL 2 context
    for it. After that, it discusses the basic structure of a WebGL application. The
    virtual car showroom application is presented as a demo of the capabilities of
    WebGL. This application also showcases the different components of a WebGL application.'

    the WebGL API to define, process, and render objects. This chapter also demonstrates
    how to perform asynchronous geometry loading using AJAX and JSON.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](0dcbfd9d-5446-48e9-90c1-841f4d160232.xhtml), *Lights*, introduces
    ESSL, the shading language for WebGL. This chapter shows how to implement a lighting
    strategy for the WebGL scene using ESSL shaders. The theory behind shading and
    reflective lighting models is covered and put into practice through a variety
    of examples.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](62d4de32-0b5b-4339-8fcc-80f739e80ec2.xhtml), *Cameras*, illustrates
    the use of matrix algebra to create and operate cameras in WebGL. The Perspective
    and Normal matrices that are used in a WebGL scene are also described here. The
    chapter also shows how to pass these matrices to ESSL shaders so that they can
    be applied to every vertex. The chapter contains several examples that show how
    to set up a camera in WebGL.'

    the use of matrices to perform geometrical transformations (move, rotate, scale)
    on scene elements. In this chapter, the concept of matrix stacks is discussed.
    It is shown how to maintain isolated transformations for every object in the scene
    using matrix stacks. Also, the chapter describes several animation techniques
    using matrix stacks and JavaScript timers. A practical demonstration is provided
    of each technique.'

    and Alpha Blending*, goes into detail about the use of colors in ESSL shaders.
    This chapter shows how to define and operate with more than one light source in
    a WebGL scene. It also explains the concepts of depth testing and alpha blending,
    and shows how these features can be used to create translucent objects. The chapter
    contains several practical exercises that put these concepts into practice.'

    how to create, manage, and map textures in a WebGL scene. The concepts of texture
    coordinates and texture mapping are presented here. This chapter discusses different
    mapping techniques that are presented through practical examples. The chapter
    also shows how to use multiple textures and cube maps.'

    a simple implementation of picking, which is the technical term that describes
    the selection and interaction of the user with objects in the scene. The method
    described in this chapter calculates mouse-click coordinates and determines whether
    the user is clicking on any of the objects being rendered in the `canvas`. The
    architecture of the solution is presented with several callback hooks that can
    be used to implement logic-specific application. A couple of examples of picking
    are given.'

    of the demos is reviewed and the virtual car showroom application outlined in
    `Chapter 1`, *Getting Started*, is revisited and expanded. Using the virtual car
    showroom as the case study, this chapter shows how to import Blender models into
