- en: Web development today requires real expertise in HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS.
    These technologies are not completely new, but there has been so much growth around
    this programming model that it can be difficult to find your bearings when trying
    to create a new website. It seems like every popular website has a different,
    special trick in rendering attractive layouts or in creating responsive and dynamic
    experiences. A beginner can feel hopeless in trying to learn how to program like
    this.

- en: Fortunately, many JavaScript libraries have arisen to meet this intense demand.
    Most of these libraries enable client-side functionality through special shortcuts
    so that a developer can utilize very powerful functionality without writing, or
    even understanding, complicated JavaScript code. The jQuery libraries are a very
    good example of this; they provide rich functionality and UI controls with only
    a few lines of code, hiding the complicated programming underneath.

- en: Telerik has taken this model one step further. They have built a powerful JavaScript
    framework called Kendo UI that is built on top of jQuery, but can create complete
    widgets with even simpler code. Not only this, it also includes server-side code
    libraries that enable developers to create widgets on the server, and all JavaScript
    is generated automatically! This is an enormous productivity boost, and enables
    both experienced web developers and beginners to operate on the same playing field.
    This book will take you on an initial journey through the Kendo UI Framework and
    show you how to create an entire set of useful and powerful widgets that will
    make your web pages shine like the best sites on the Internet.
