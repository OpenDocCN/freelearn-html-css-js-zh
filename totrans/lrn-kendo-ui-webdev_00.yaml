  zh: 前言
- en: Web development today requires real expertise in HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS.
    These technologies are not completely new, but there has been so much growth around
    this programming model that it can be difficult to find your bearings when trying
    to create a new website. It seems like every popular website has a different,
    special trick in rendering attractive layouts or in creating responsive and dynamic
    experiences. A beginner can feel hopeless in trying to learn how to program like
    this.

  zh: 今天的网络开发需要真正的 HTML5、JavaScript 和 CSS 专业知识。这些技术并非完全新颖，但围绕这种编程模型的增长如此之快，以至于在尝试创建新网站时很难找到方向。似乎每个流行的网站都有不同的、特殊的技巧来渲染吸引人的布局或在创建响应式和动态体验方面。初学者在尝试学习如何以这种方式编程时可能会感到绝望。
- en: Fortunately, many JavaScript libraries have arisen to meet this intense demand.
    Most of these libraries enable client-side functionality through special shortcuts
    so that a developer can utilize very powerful functionality without writing, or
    even understanding, complicated JavaScript code. The jQuery libraries are a very
    good example of this; they provide rich functionality and UI controls with only
    a few lines of code, hiding the complicated programming underneath.

  zh: 幸运的是，许多 JavaScript 库应运而生以满足这种强烈的需求。这些库中的大多数都通过特殊的快捷方式提供客户端功能，以便开发者可以在不编写，甚至不理解复杂的
    JavaScript 代码的情况下利用非常强大的功能。jQuery 库是这方面的一个很好的例子；它们仅用几行代码就提供了丰富的功能和控制台，隐藏了下面的复杂编程。
- en: Telerik has taken this model one step further. They have built a powerful JavaScript
    framework called Kendo UI that is built on top of jQuery, but can create complete
    widgets with even simpler code. Not only this, it also includes server-side code
    libraries that enable developers to create widgets on the server, and all JavaScript
    is generated automatically! This is an enormous productivity boost, and enables
    both experienced web developers and beginners to operate on the same playing field.
    This book will take you on an initial journey through the Kendo UI Framework and
    show you how to create an entire set of useful and powerful widgets that will
    make your web pages shine like the best sites on the Internet.

  zh: Telerik 将此模型推进了一步。他们构建了一个强大的 JavaScript 框架，称为 Kendo UI，该框架建立在 jQuery 之上，但可以用更简单的代码创建完整的控件。不仅如此，它还包括服务器端代码库，使开发者能够在服务器上创建控件，并且所有
    JavaScript 都会自动生成！这极大地提高了生产力，并使经验丰富的网络开发者和初学者能够在同一赛场上操作。本书将带您初步了解 Kendo UI 框架，并展示如何创建一套有用且强大的小部件，使您的网页像互联网上最好的网站一样闪耀。
