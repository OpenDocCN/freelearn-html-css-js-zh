    ServiceNow scripting. Custom applications are a great way to create functionality
    not included with the ServiceNow product. We will be looking at creating a custom
    application and using scripting as part of our application. We will also learn
    about end-to-end creation of a custom application before exploring how to test
    and deploy our new custom application.

- en: The ability to build a custom application in ServiceNow makes ServiceNow such
    a versatile product. As ServiceNow was first released to the market as a service
    desk solution, developers have explored the potential of the platform, and since
    then it has been used in various areas of the business.
  prefs: []

    with the baseline system, and for this, we can create a custom application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Before creating a custom application, it is worth considering whether a custom
    application will provide the best solution. Sometimes, we can use an existing
    ServiceNow application to perform the functionality we want to achieve, using
    it directly or slightly modifying it for our needs. If this is the case, then
    it is worth considering not creating a custom application and using the platform
    instead.

    application or simply does not exist at that point, it is advisable to create
    a custom application.

    an update set. This is a very helpful method as this allows the update set to
    be sent to other instances as a retrieved update set, or even exported and imported
    on any ServiceNow instance. This makes this method of deployment arguably the
    most versatile.

    fee, monthly subscription, or through consultancy with the developing company.

    up the code in the application into a staging area that can be edited before publishing.
