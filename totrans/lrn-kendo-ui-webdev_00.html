These technologies are not completely new, but there has been so much growth around this programming model that it can be difficult to find your bearings when trying to create a new website. It seems like every popular website has a different, special trick in rendering attractive layouts or in creating responsive and dynamic experiences. A beginner can feel hopeless in trying to learn how to program like this.</p><p>Fortunately, many JavaScript libraries have arisen to meet this intense demand. Most of these libraries enable client-side functionality through special shortcuts so that a developer can utilize very powerful functionality without writing, or even understanding, complicated JavaScript code. The jQuery libraries are a very good example of this; they provide rich functionality and UI controls with only a few lines of code, hiding the complicated programming underneath.</p><p>Telerik has taken this model one step further. They have built a powerful JavaScript framework called Kendo UI that is built on top of jQuery, but can create complete widgets with even simpler code. Not only this, it also includes server-side code libraries that enable developers to create widgets on the server, and all JavaScript is generated automatically! This is an enormous productivity boost, and enables both experienced web developers and beginners to operate on the same playing field. This book will take you on an initial journey through the Kendo UI Framework and show you how to create an entire set of useful and powerful widgets that will make your web pages shine like the best sites on the Internet.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Interacting with Data: DataSource, Templates, TabStrip, and Grid">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Interacting with Data: DataSource, Templates, and Grid</em>, teaches the foundation of the Kendo UI DataSource and Template JavaScript objects.
