- en: This book covers many concepts that any web developer may need to know. These
    concepts may be new or known, but forgotten. The first two chapters in this book
    will cover the basic elements and attributes of HTML. The next four chapters will
    cover the concepts and syntax of CSS. JavaScript will be the focus of the next
    five chapters. Finally, we will cover external libraries. These include Bootstrap,
    jQuery, and Angular. Because this is a reference guide, it is not set up as a
    read-through tutorial. Each section and concept is written to stand on its own
    so that you can find the piece of information that you need quickly.

- en: Most likely, for this book, you will need nothing that you are not already using!
    You will need a computer, a browser, and a text editor. Each chapter will cover
    different concepts and languages, so there may be differences between each chapter.

- en: For Chapters 1-5, you will only need a text editor and a browser.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For Chapters 6-11, you will need the same text editor and browser, but with
    JavaScript being a programming language, I would recommend an integrated development
    environment (IDE). JetBrains makes a great IDE called WebStorm for web development.
    However, this is not necessarily needed for these chapters.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For Chapters 12-14, you will again need a text editor and browser. An IDE would
    also be very helpful for this section. Anytime you are dealing with complex frameworks,
    an IDE will make your life easier.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although you can just use a notepad and a browser to do any sort of development,
    an IDE is always preferred and suggested for development in any specific language.
    I would suggest using Adobe Dreamweaver for beginners. The intellisense of IDE
    makes it a lot easier to code as it auto-suggests various methods, names, and
    variables, so you don't have to remember everything. As we will be dealing with
    the elements and document nodes in the JQuery section, you should have extensions
    enabled in your browser. ECMA Script 6 is very recent and not fully supported
    by all browsers. In some examples, you might have to load ES6 compilers to enable
    that feature in your browser. However, I would highly recommend that you use the
    latest version of Google Chrome as a client, as it covers most of the sections
    in ES6.
