    it was in the context of learning, and how learning by doing is usually the best
    way to solidify knowledge in your brain. But even if you aren’t learning new skills,
    it’s also important to maintain old ones. While Assembly is a language I’ll likely
    never have to use professionally in my life (and there’s even a low chance I’ll
    do it in my own projects), practicing any type of coding keeps the more general
    “programming skills” fresh.

    Another possibility I like to suggest is a **PIM**, a **personal information manager**.
    This is an application that allows you to store, manage, and utilize important
    pieces of personal information, usually things such as contacts, appointments,
    and notes. I like this idea so much, in fact, that I’ve used such a project in

    programming topics, and they can also be done with any technology. You can, of
    course, build it with React and Node, Angular and Java, or just plain HTML + CSS
    + JS with client-side data storage. Or, do it in Python and have a purely text-based
    interface. You can host it in a cloud provider if you like, or on your own home

    light of day! Nothing says you have to share your work with anyone else, or even
    use it after you write it. In fact, you don‘t necessarily even have to *finish*
    a project! My private source code repository is littered with aborted projects
    and ideas I dropped halfway through for one reason or another, and most developers
    are that way.

    that most developers spend more time reading code than writing code – whether
    it’s understanding an existing code base they must support, reading through their
    own code to remember how they did things, or reading the code of others for learning,
    it’s a skill all of its own.

    browsers for decades now. This is something that developers sometimes forget is
    there! To some extent, that‘s because browser developer tools have mostly taken
    the place of View Source, but no matter how you do it specifically, I’m generically
    talking about the idea of looking at the work of others.
  id: totrans-33

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you go to a website and see something cool, in most cases, you can use
    View Source or developer tools to examine the code. Now, this isn‘t quite as true
    as it used to be due to modern developer techniques. In the olden days of the
    late 90s/early 2000s, View Source was great because what you got was pure, untouched
    HTML, CSS, and JS. There was no mystery; it was all right there for you to examine
    and learn from.
  id: totrans-34
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That’s still true in the sense that HTML, CSS, and JS are the lingua franca
    of the web. No matter what developer tools, libraries, frameworks, or toolkits
    you use to build a website, it always boils down to HTML, CSS, and JS. There may
    be many different abstractions on top of the final code that the browser runs,
    but it still boils down to those three in the end.
  id: totrans-35
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But the final form that the browser uses to display the web page can differ
    drastically nowadays from what the developer wrote owing to those abstractions.
    If they developed the web page with TypeScript, for example, the output code can
    sometimes look drastically different in its final JS form. Or, if they used Angular
    or React, then the code they wrote can look virtually nothing like what runs in
    the browser. There are also tools called **obfuscators**, which explicitly try
    to make the code look as different as possible and explicitly more difficult to
    read. There are also compressors (called **minifiers**) that try to minimize the
    size of the code in an attempt to make loading the page more efficient, but this
    too can make it harder to read. So, code is sometimes hard to read by accident,
    and sometimes on purpose, but it ultimately makes View Source less useful than
    it used to be.
  id: totrans-36

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Still, you can sometimes gain valuable insights even by looking at obfuscated
    code. Even if you can’t quite work out the exact code that is responsible for
    a given effect, for example, you may still be able to get a conceptual idea of
    how it’s done, which is often all you’re really after.
  id: totrans-37

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While modern code may be difficult to read, there are some things to be aware
    of that can help. The main one is something called **source maps**. These are
    special files that can be part of the output when compressing or obfuscating JS,
    or when transpiling from TypeScript to JS, offering a way to map code within a
    file, as seen in the browser, back to its original source code. They enable a
    developer to examine code more easily by showing the original source code in a
    code viewer or debugger, even if the code running in the browser (or Node, or
    another runtime environment) is the minified or transpiled version. This mapping
    between the code at runtime and the original source code is crucial for debugging
    purposes and being able to learn from it.

    White hat hackers, otherwise known as “ethical hackers,” are those who operate
    legally and with the consent of a target with the express intent of finding and
    disclosing vulnerabilities. These people are often engaged by companies to find
    flaws in their sites. Black hats are those who use their skills for illegal or
    malicious purposes. Their motives frequently involve financial gain, espionage,
    or just to cause chaos. Grey hats fall somewhere in between, in that they look
    for vulnerabilities with the intent of disclosing them rather than exploiting
    them for nefarious purposes, but they do not operate with the consent or pre-knowledge
    of a target. Companies often have a love/hate relationship with grey hats because
    while it’s good for someone like that to find a problem and let the company know
    before the black hats do, it’s still rather disconcerting to get a report from
    someone unsolicited.

    problem; however, it won’t usually be that easy, so you’ll have to start coming
    at this sideways. Like, can you see a place where you might be able to hack the

    I think that’s unfair, because not all certifications are created equal. Some,
    like the Novell test, can be passed by someone with just basic knowledge and experience,
    but that would never have worked for one of the Cisco tests, for example. Those
    require you to really know your stuff and to be able to show it in practical ways.

    your past experience, in a sense, becomes your certification. If you’ve actually
    built one or more complex websites, then that shows me, as a hiring manager, what
    you know better than virtually any certification ever could.

    of experience to show, then I would say there is some value in certifications.
    They won’t have the same value to every interviewer regardless, but for those
    who give them more weight, it may be the difference between getting hired and
    not. I would say, don’t spend an inordinate amount of time and money on them,
    though; look for the ones that (a) aren’t too expensive, and (b) you can pass
    based on what you *actually* know and without a huge investment of study time.

    – which I don’t believe I’m alone in – is to not put *as much* stock in certifications.
    It may still make sense to pursue one every now and again in a more targeted and
    focused way, such as if you are looking to switch positions and want to have as
    much evidence that you can do the new job as possible. But “collecting certifications”
    – where you just keep getting them with the thought that it *may* be beneficial
    to your career generally – is probably a bit of wasted time, effort, and money.
    It’s probably better to spend the time building things to gain experience through
    doing, so you have more demonstrative evidence of your skills.

    certifications. At last count, I held something like 90 different certifications.
    While some, such as the Novell one, didn’t really reflect my knowledge and abilities
    at the time, a lot of them actually did. But either way, the simple fact is that
    they never had any tangible benefit to my career. They didn’t help me get my first
    job (I didn’t have any before then), nor did they help me get any big salary increase
    later (proving what I could do on the job very much did, though). Do I feel all
    that time and money was worth it? No, I honestly don’t. I think it’s true that
    I learned some things from the studying I did for them, though, so in that sense,
    I probably did get some benefit, but not enough to justify the time and money.

    up helping yourself in the process. This comes in many forms. Helping a coworker
    with a problem often leads to you gaining insights you didn’t have before. Teaching
    others helps solidify knowledge in your own mind. And when you contribute to projects,
    you gain a sense of accomplishment on top of whatever technical benefits you also
    get.

    because we all depend on others, whether they taught us, helped us through problems,
    or simply created software and tools that we depend on. Looking for opportunities
    to do the same thing yourself is a great way to build your skillset and other
    intangible qualities too.

    to open-source projects (the abbreviation **FOSS**, short for **free/open-source
    software**, is typically used, and I will do so here). You can, of course, start
    your own; there’s nothing wrong with that and it has a lot of benefits. But here,
    I’m focusing on finding projects you like and contributing to them.

    early on in their own learning, because they figure there’s nothing they could
    possibly contribute. Let me assure you that this is wrong! FOSS projects are often
    in need of people doing things that don’t require a high level of technical skill.
    For example, documentation is something that a lot of projects are lacking and
    that the maintainers of projects are all too happy to have people help with.

    “introductory” documentation, as someone new to using a project would need, is

    time getting up to speed with such a contribution, which is for sure a valuable
    thing.'

    clone the project’s repo, as was discussed in [*Chapter 4*](B18315_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor105).
    That gives you a local copy on your own machine that you can then start hacking
    at without any risk to the existing project’s code. If things don’t go well, it’s
    no big deal; you can always clone a fresh copy and start again, no harm no foul.

    (assuming the project is using GitHub) when you believe the documentation is ready.
    To be sure, there’s no guarantee it will be accepted, or that there won’t be comments
    sent back about things they’d like to see. But very often, you’ll get a great,
    big “thank you!” and an immediate acceptance.

    way to contribute. It’s obviously great for the project to get bugs resolved,
    but it’s fantastic for you too because not only does it help you learn the code
    base of the project so you can contribute more in the future, but it means you’re
    reading code and learning from it, so selfishly, it’s going to benefit you greatly.
    And you don’t need to tackle the trickiest bugs right off the bat! Finding ones
    that appear to be on the simpler side, even “silly” things such as maybe a label
    on a screen having a spelling mistake, can get your foot in the door.

    you may want to have some discussions on a message forum or mailing list of Discord
    – however the project members communicate – to get some level of buy-in so you
    don’t wind up wasting a lot of time on something that ultimately won’t have a
    chance of being accepted (then again, just the experience of building the feature
    can benefit you, so keep that in mind too). It’s also good to know you won’t start
    working on something that a project member is already working on.

    offer to build something a bit more robust. Things are a little different in this
    regard than they used to be because most FOSS projects are hosted on sites such
    as GitHub, and they may not have their own unique website, as was most common
    years ago. But it’s still the case that projects will often want to have their
    own “face,” so to speak, even if they’re hosted on GitHub, and offering to build
    that – and maybe offering up some design ideas or prototypes to make the case
    – can be something that will be valued too.

    that will be appreciated not only by the users of the project but also by the
    maintainers, since they can then focus more on writing code than helping people.

    a book ain’t easy, believe me, and no matter how hard you try, there’s usually
    something that doesn’t work right. Maybe there are differences across operating
    systems you didn’t know about. Maybe there are different versions of libraries
    that you didn’t use when writing the example code that breaks those examples.

    That’s because it’s logical to think that most technical books are being read
    by people who are trying to learn, not by those who are already experts in a given
    topic. Given that supposition, it therefore makes sense that a technical reviewer
    might not be either (though, certainly, you would always be expected to have *some*

    React book might notice you and approach you, recognizing that you’re someone
    who knows their stuff. Another way is to know the author. Authors are often asked
    whether they know anyone who could serve as a technical reviewer, so if you have
    a strong network then you may get asked by people you are acquainted with who
    are writing books. The third way is to simply approach a publisher! Go to their
    website and look for contact links for editors, or maybe acquisition people, and
    send them a note saying you’re interested in being a technical reviewer. You might
    not hit paydirt right away, but you also may find your name added to a list that
    gets you contacted later on.

    on their sites that direct you on how to submit book proposals to them. Typically,

    scalability, security, and integration with other systems. They make high-level
    design choices and set technical standards including the tooling to be used, the
    platform to be built on, and the coding standards to be adhered to. This is the
    point where, usually, you stop coding on a daily basis, though many architects
    still find some time to code a little bit, but you’ll spend more time on things
    such as diagrams, documentation, and meetings.
