You have not just learned about a couple of basic things, but also created a simple project using several features so you now have the first-hand elementary experience of using WebStorm, and now it is time to go further and cultivate your skills.</p><p class="calibre7">In this chapter, we are going to deal with a number of really smart features that will enable you to fundamentally change your approach to web development and learn how to gain maximum benefit from WebStorm. We are going to study the following in this chapter:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Syntax highlighting</li><li class="listitem">On-the-fly code analysis</li><li class="listitem">Smart code features</li><li class="listitem">Multiselect feature</li><li class="listitem">Refactoring facility</li><li class="listitem">Advanced navigation</li></ul></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_1"><a id="ch02lvl1sec13" class="calibre1"/>Syntax highlighting</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">Syntax highlighting <a id="id44" class="calibre1"/>facility is one of the core things that any code editor must be great at, because even a dozen of uncolored lines of code may be confusing and even irritating. Further, you can see how WebStorm performs the highlighting:</p><div><img src="img/00020.jpeg" alt="Syntax highlighting" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">WebStorm not only neatly highlights the code, but also provides you with a bunch of flexible settings for doing this. It means that you are able to customize each particle of the code appearance completely up to your preferences. You are enabled to customize highlighting for JavaScript and CoffeeScript and TypeScript, CSS and SASS/SCSS, JSON and XML and YAML, and so on.</p><p class="calibre7">To configure syntax <a id="id45" class="calibre1"/>highlighting, open the <strong class="calibre8">Preferences</strong> window, then go to the <strong class="calibre8">Colors &amp; Fonts</strong> subsection of the <strong class="calibre8">Editor</strong> section, and choose the language or technology for customizing its code styling:</p><div><img src="img/00021.jpeg" alt="Syntax highlighting" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">For each code unit—keywords, tags, numbers and words, comments, punctuation signs, variable and function declarations—you can change its appearance—bold or italic, the color of the foreground and background, font effects, and much more. Below the configuration panel, you can find a preview panel where you can observe all the changes you performed in real time. Besides, if you know what code unit you would like to customize but don't know what it is called, you can simply click on any sign or word of the code in the preview <a id="id46" class="calibre1"/>panel, and it will be automatically chosen in the list of code unit names, as well as all occurrences of the same type of unit get to blink so you can see what you are choosing.</p><p class="calibre7">After customizing, you can save all settings as a new scheme so that the settings can be applied for further projects, as well as this one. To do this, you can simply click the <strong class="calibre8">Save As...</strong> button above the settings, and name this new code style scheme.</p><p class="calibre7">WebStorm is also able to detect the language you are using in specific contexts and will highlight the code accordingly. So, for example, if you are writing JavaScript code inside an HTML file, WebStorm will be able to detect this and highlight your code correctly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch02lvl1sec14" class="calibre1"/>On-the-fly code analysis</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">WebStorm will <a id="id47" class="calibre1"/>perform static code analysis on your code on the fly. The editor will check the code, based on the language used, and the rules you specify and highlight warnings and errors as you type. This is a very powerful feature that means you don't need to have an external linter and will catch most errors quickly, thus making a dynamic and complex language like JavaScript more predictable and easy to use.</p><p class="calibre7">Runtime error and any other error, such as syntax or performance, are two things to consider. To investigate the first one, you need tests or a debugger, and it is obvious that they have almost nothing in common with the IDE itself (although, when these facilities are integrated into the IDE, such a synergy is better, but that is not it). You can also examine the second type of errors the same way, but is it convenient? Just imagine that you need to run tests after writing the next line of code. It is no go! Won't it be more efficient and helpful to use something that keeps an eye on and analyzes each word being typed in order to notify you about probable performance issues and bugs, code style and workflow issues, various validation issues, warn of dead code and other likely execution issues before executing the code, to say nothing of reporting inadvertent misprints. WebStorm is the best fit for it. It performs a deep-level analysis of each line, each word in the code. Moreover, you needn't break off your developing process when WebStorm scans your code; it is performed on the fly and thus so called:</p><div><img src="img/00022.jpeg" alt="On-the-fly code analysis" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">WebStorm also enables you to get a full inspection report on demand. To get it, go to the menu: <strong class="calibre8">Code</strong> | <strong class="calibre8">Inspect Code</strong>. It pops up the <strong class="calibre8">Specify Inspection Scope</strong> dialog where you can define what exactly you would like to inspect, and click <strong class="calibre8">OK</strong>. Depending on what is selected and of what size, you need to wait a little for the process to finish, and you will see the detailed results where the Terminal window is located:</p><div><img src="img/00023.jpeg" alt="On-the-fly code analysis" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">You can expand all the items, if needed. To the right of this inspection result list you can see an explanation <a id="id48" class="calibre1"/>window. To jump to the erroneous code lines, you can simply click on the necessary item, and you will flip into the corresponding line.</p><p class="calibre7">Besides simple indicating where some issue is located, WebStorm also unequivocally suggests the ways to eliminate this issue. And you needn't even make any changes yourself—WebStorm already has quick solutions, which you need just to click on, and they will be instantly inserted into the code:</p><div><img src="img/00024.jpeg" alt="On-the-fly code analysis" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">We will go more into <a id="id49" class="calibre1"/>the details of code analysis and quality in <a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 7. Analyzing and Debugging Your Code" href="part0048_split_000.html#1DOR01-0c7cc7dc97984506a3b137496d3ab1d6">Chapter 7</a>, <em class="calibre9">Analyzing and Debugging Your Code</em>.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch02lvl1sec15" class="calibre1"/>Smart code features</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">Being an <strong class="calibre8">Integrated Development Environment</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">IDE</strong>) and tending to be intelligent, WebStorm provides a <a id="id50" class="calibre1"/>really powerful pack of features which you can use to strongly improve your efficiency and save a lot of time.</p><p class="calibre7">One of the most useful and hot features is code completion. WebStorm continually analyzes and processes the code of the whole project, and smartly suggests the pieces of code appropriate in the current context, and even more—alongside the method names you can find the usage of these methods. Of course, code completion itself is not a fresh innovation, but WebStorm performs it in a much smarter way than other IDEs do. WebStorm can auto-complete a lot things: Class and function names, keywords and parameters, types and properties, punctuation, and even file paths.</p><p class="calibre7">By default, the code completion facility is on. To invoke it, simply start typing some code. For example, in the following image you can see how WebStorm suggests object methods:</p><div><img src="img/00025.jpeg" alt="Smart code features" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">You can navigate through the list of suggestions using your mouse or the <em class="calibre9">Up</em> and <em class="calibre9">Down</em> arrow keys. However, the list can be very long, which makes it not very convenient to browse. To reduce it and retain only the things appropriate in the current context, keep on typing the next letters. Besides typing only initial consecutive letter of the method, you can either type something from the middle of the method name, or even use the CamelCase style, which is <a id="id51" class="calibre1"/>usually the quickest way of typing really long method names:</p><div><img src="img/00026.jpeg" alt="Smart code features" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">It may turn out for some reason that the code completion isn't working automatically. To manually invoke it, press <em class="calibre9">Ctrl</em> + <em class="calibre9">Space</em> on Mac or <em class="calibre9">Ctrl</em> + <em class="calibre9">Space</em> on Windows.</p><p class="calibre7">To insert the suggested method, press <em class="calibre9">Enter</em>; to replace the string next to the current cursor position with the suggested method, press <em class="calibre9">Tab</em>. If you want the facility to also arrange correct syntactic surroundings for the method, press <em class="calibre9">Shift</em> + <em class="calibre9">⌘</em> + <em class="calibre9">Enter</em> on Mac or <em class="calibre9">Ctrl</em> + <em class="calibre9">Shift</em> + <em class="calibre9">Enter</em> on Windows, and missing brackets and/or new lines will be inserted, up to the styling standards of the current language of the code.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch02lvl1sec16" class="calibre1"/>The multiselect feature</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">With the multiple <a id="id52" class="calibre1"/>selection (or simply multiselect) feature, you can place the cursor in several locations simultaneously, and when you will type the code it will be applied at all these positions. For example, you need to add different background colors for each table cell, and then make them of twenty-pixel width. In this case, you don't need to perform these identical tasks repeatedly and can save a lot of time by placing the cursor after the <code class="email">&lt;td&gt;</code> tag, press <em class="calibre9">Alt</em>, and put the cursor in each <code class="email">&lt;td&gt;</code> tag, which you are going to apply styling to:</p><div><img src="img/00027.jpeg" alt="The multiselect feature" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">Now you can start typing the necessary attribute—it is <code class="email">bgcolor</code>. Note that WebStorm performs smart code completion here too, independently of you typing something on a single line or not. You <a id="id53" class="calibre1"/>get empty values for <code class="email">bgcolor</code> attributes, and you fill them out individually a bit later. You need also to change the width so you can continue typing. As cell widths are arranged to be fixed-sized, simply add the value for <code class="email">width</code> attributes as well. An example is shown in the following image:</p><div><img src="img/00028.jpeg" alt="The multiselect feature" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">Moreover, the multiselect feature can select identical values or just words independently, that is, you needn't place the cursor in multiple locations. Let us look at this feature by using another example. Say, you changed your mind and decided to colorize not backgrounds but borders of several consecutive cells. You may instantly think of using a simple replace feature but you needn't replace all attribute occurrences, only several consecutive ones. For doing this, you can place the cursor on the first attribute, which you are going to perform changes from, and click <em class="calibre9">Ctrl</em> + <em class="calibre9">G</em> on Mac or <em class="calibre9">Alt</em> + <em class="calibre9">J</em> on Windows as many times as you need. One by <a id="id54" class="calibre1"/>one the same attributes will be selected, and you can replace the <code class="email">bgcolor</code> attribute for the <code class="email">bordercolor</code> one:</p><div><img src="img/00029.jpeg" alt="The multiselect feature" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">You can also select all occurrences of any word by clicking <em class="calibre9">Ctrl</em> + <em class="calibre9">command</em> + <em class="calibre9">G</em> on Mac or <em class="calibre9">Ctrl</em> + <em class="calibre9">Alt</em> + <em class="calibre9">Shift</em> + <em class="calibre9">J</em>.</p><p class="calibre7">To get out of the multiselect mode you have to click in a different position or use the <em class="calibre9">Esc</em> key.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch02lvl1sec17" class="calibre1"/>Refactoring facility</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">Throughout the <a id="id55" class="calibre1"/>development process, it is almost unavoidable that you have to use refactoring. Also, the bigger code base you have, the more difficult it becomes to control the code, and when you need to refactor some code, you will most likely be up against some issues relating to, for example, naming omission or not taking into consideration function usage. You learned that WebStorm performs a thorough code analysis so it understands what is connected with what and, if some changes occur, it collates them and decides what is acceptable, and what is not to perform in the rest of the code. Let us try a simple example.</p><p class="calibre7">In a big HTML file you have the following line:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">&lt;input id="search" type="search" placeholder="search" /&gt;</pre></div><p class="calibre7">And in a big JavaScript file you have another one:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">var search = document.getElementById('search');</pre></div><p class="calibre7">You decided to rename the <code class="email">id</code> attribute's value of the input element to <code class="email">search_field</code> because it is less confusing. You could simply rename it here but after that you would have to manually find all the occurrences of the word <code class="email">search</code> in the code. It is evident that the word is rather frequent so you would spend a lot of time recognizing usage cases appropriate in the current context or not. And there is a high probability that you would forget something important, and even more time will be spent on investigating an issue. Instead, you can entrust WebStorm with this task. Select the code unit to refactor (in our case, it is the <code class="email">search</code> value of the <code class="email">id</code> attribute), and click <em class="calibre9">Ctrl</em> + <em class="calibre9">T</em> on Mac or <em class="calibre9">Ctrl</em> + <em class="calibre9">Alt</em> + <em class="calibre9">Shift</em> + <em class="calibre9">T</em> on Windows (or simply click the <strong class="calibre8">Refactor</strong> menu item) to call the <strong class="calibre8">Refactor This</strong> dialog. There, choose the <a id="id56" class="calibre1"/>
<strong class="calibre8">Rename…</strong> item and enter the new name for the selected code unit (<code class="email">search_field</code> in our case). To get only a preview of what will happen during the refactoring process, click the <strong class="calibre8">Preview</strong> button, and all the changes to apply will be displayed in the bottom. You can walk through the hierarchical tree and either apply the change by clicking the <strong class="calibre8">Do Refactor</strong> button, or not. If you need a preview, you can simply click the <strong class="calibre8">Refactor</strong> button. What you will see is that the <code class="email">id</code> attribute got the <code class="email">search_field</code> value, not the type or placeholder values, even if they have the same value, and in the JavaScript file you got <code class="email">getElementById('search_field')</code>.</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="note06" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre7">Note that even though WebStorm can perform various smart tasks, it still remains a program, and some issues can be caused by so-called artificial intelligence imperfection, so you should always be careful when performing the refactoring. In particular, manually check the <code class="email">var</code> declarations because WebStorm sometimes can apply the changes to them as well, but it is not always necessary because of the scope.</p></div><p class="calibre7">Of course, this is just a little of what you are enabled to perform with refactoring. The basic things that the refactoring facility allows you to do are as follows:</p><div><img src="img/00030.jpeg" alt="Refactoring facility" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">The elements in the preceding screenshot are explained as follows:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><strong class="calibre8">Rename…</strong>: You have already got familiar with this refactoring. Once again, with it you can rename code units, and WebStorm automatically will fix all references of them in the code. The shortcut is <em class="calibre9">Shift</em> + <em class="calibre9">F6</em>.</li><li class="listitem"><strong class="calibre8">Change Signature…</strong>: This feature is used for changing function names, and adding/removing, reordering, or renaming function parameters, that is, changing the function signature. The shortcut is <em class="calibre9">⌘</em> + <em class="calibre9">F6</em> for Mac and <em class="calibre9">Ctrl</em> + <em class="calibre9">F6</em> for Windows.</li><li class="listitem"><strong class="calibre8">Move…</strong>: This feature enables you to move files or directories within a project, and it <a id="id57" class="calibre1"/>simultaneously repairs all references to these project elements in the code so you needn't manually repair them. The shortcut is <em class="calibre9">F6</em>.</li><li class="listitem"><strong class="calibre8">Copy…</strong>: With this feature, you can copy a file or directory or even a class, with its structure, from one place to another. The shortcut is <em class="calibre9">F5</em>.</li><li class="listitem"><strong class="calibre8">Safe Delete…</strong>: This feature is really helpful. It allows you to safely delete any code or entire files from the project. When performing this refactoring, you will be asked about whether it is necessary to inspect comments and strings or all text files for the occurrence of the required piece of code or not. The shortcut is <em class="calibre9">⌘</em> + <em class="calibre9">delete</em> for Mac and <em class="calibre9">Alt</em> + <em class="calibre9">Delete</em> for Windows.</li><li class="listitem"><strong class="calibre8">Variable…</strong>: This refactoring feature declares a new variable where the result of the selected statement or expression is put. It can be useful when you realize there are too many occurrences of a certain expression so it can be turned into a variable, and the expression can just initialize it. The shortcut is <em class="calibre9">Alt</em> +<em class="calibre9">⌘</em> + <em class="calibre9">V</em> for Mac and <em class="calibre9">Ctrl</em> + <em class="calibre9">Alt</em> + <em class="calibre9">V</em> for Windows.</li><li class="listitem"><strong class="calibre8">Parameter…</strong>: When you need to add a new parameter to some method and appropriately update its calls, use this feature. The shortcut is <em class="calibre9">Alt</em> + <em class="calibre9">⌘</em> + <em class="calibre9">P</em> for Mac and <em class="calibre9">Ctrl</em> + <em class="calibre9">Alt</em> + <em class="calibre9">P</em> for Windows.</li><li class="listitem"><strong class="calibre8">Method…</strong>: During this refactoring, the code block you selected undergoes analysis, through which the input and output variables get detected, and the extracted function receives the output variable as a return value. The shortcut is <em class="calibre9">Alt</em> + <em class="calibre9">⌘</em> + <em class="calibre9">M</em> for Mac and <em class="calibre9">Ctrl</em> + <em class="calibre9">Alt</em> + <em class="calibre9">M</em> for Windows.</li><li class="listitem"><strong class="calibre8">Inline…</strong>: The inline <a id="id58" class="calibre1"/>refactoring works contrariwise to the extract method refactoring—it replaces surplus variables with their initializers making the code more compact and concise. The shortcut is <em class="calibre9">Alt</em> + <em class="calibre9">⌘</em> + <em class="calibre9">N</em> for Mac and <em class="calibre9">Ctrl</em> + <em class="calibre9">Alt</em> + <em class="calibre9">N</em> for Windows.</li></ul></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch02lvl1sec18" class="calibre1"/>Advanced navigation</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">Navigation is one of the <a id="id59" class="calibre1"/>most important things in any IDE because if you cannot quickly find or switch over to whatever you want, there is little reason to use such a program, as there is no time saving aspect.</p><p class="calibre7">Partially, we examined some navigation features WebStorm provides. They are the menu panel, the navigation toolbar, and tool tabs. It is all great but we still need to perform a lot of mouse movements to reach the necessary place in the code. We are going to see how WebStorm can help us working with code by going through some of these power navigation tools. We are going to go through them based on what type of action they can help us perform.</p></div>
