- en: In early 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus
    outbreak a global pandemic. Since then, companies have scrambled to pivot to at-home
    and online operations. Schools around the world were no different. Hopefully,
    by the time you are reading this chapter, COVID-19 is only referenced in historical
    archives, but it was the catalyst for a global movement toward online teaching
    and learning tools. **Google Meet**, a video conferencing app launched in 2017,
    expanded from hosting meetings of up to 30 attendees with limited features to
    being a large-scale communication tool.

- en: From 2021, Google Meet can host online video conferences of up to 250 participants
    and up to 100,000 view-only guests. At the time of writing, Google has already
    announced several more features launching in Google Meet later this year. Because
    of the sudden move to online teaching and learning, Google Meet is now an integral
    part of Google Classroom. This chapter will focus on enabling Google Meet and
    provide an overview of Google Meet's features, while the next chapter will provide
    pedagogical strategies for teaching online.

    Google Workspace for Education, certain user groups, such as teachers, can be
    set at the administrator level so that anyone within that group can have host
    controls in a meeting. In many school divisions, students are not able to create
    their own meetings so that a student doesn't accidentally have host controls over
    a meeting that a teacher is leading. Other terms for the host include the meeting
    creator or organizer.

    sees on the screen is the same as what the participants of the meeting also see.
    However, it is also the least secure since computer notifications or window switching
    can display sensitive information to participants. There are several stories I
    have heard of teachers forgetting that they are presenting a screen and checking
    their emails or recording marks with the entire class watching.
  prefs: []

- en: Presenting a window only solves this problem, but it is more cumbersome if the
    presenter is using multiple different programs. Whenever the presenter wants to
    change program windows, they will need to stop presenting the current window and
    then present the new window. Whether to present the entire screen or a window
    depends on the presenter's preference of managing windows and security. Neither
    presenting an entire screen nor presenting a window shares the desktop audio.

    the results of a poll is when I let them choose when to have a unit exam. While
    you will be able to see who voted for what, displaying the poll results does not
    display which students voted for which selection. It only displays the final tally.

    When a meeting is recorded, an `mp4` video file will be added to the meeting creator's
    Google Drive and shared with whoever started the recording. Google Chat text is
    also recorded as a separate file when recording is enabled. Only the portion of
    the meeting for which recording was turned on will be saved. Participants outside
    the organization will receive a notification that the meeting is being recorded.

    being further published in a public space, such as social media. Therefore, remember
    that content, whether curricular or tangential, may reflect negatively on your
    pedagogy and can be used as evidence against your teaching practices. This fear
    is often enough to deter many teachers from recording meetings.

    Google Meet recordings have lots of identifying footage of students, their names,
    and where they are joining your class from. During the COVID-19 pandemic, online
    teaching surged. One of the unintended outcomes was how much teachers became aware
    of their students' home situations.

    the scene behind the student included inappropriately dressed parents, family
    members using illicit materials, or students sitting in the street to use someone
    else's Wi-Fi. Needless to say, recording student webcams can cause unintended
    complications for the teacher when something unexpected happens on a student's
    camera.

    within the meeting, a recording can be made with only the organizer. The organizer
    can still share their screen to present slides and other supplementary content.
    The added benefit of recording meetings with only the teacher is that the same
    video can be used for multiple classes.
  prefs: []

- en: One disadvantage is that this recording must be made prior to the class time,
    which means more work. However, the benefit of having videos of the lessons for
    absent students may outweigh the additional work to first create the videos. Students
    who are present may even watch the pre-recorded videos again to clarify their
    understanding of parts of the lesson. From a personal perspective, I have been
    recording course lessons since 2014 and have found them invaluable to my pedagogy.
