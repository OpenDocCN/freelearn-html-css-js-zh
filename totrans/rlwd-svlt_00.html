<p>In today’s digital age, web development is ever-evolving, with new tools and frameworks emerging almost daily. Among them, Svelte stands out, being voted in the top place as the most beloved framework in a recent developer survey (<a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-web-frameworks-and-technologies">https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-web-frameworks-and-technologies</a>).

<p>In this section, we will lay the foundation for writing Svelte components. We will kick things off by delving into the lifecycles of Svelte components. Then, we will learn how to style and theme our Svelte components. After that, we will explore the intricacies of data passing between components and finally wrap up with techniques to compose components into a cohesive Svelte application.</p>
