    on the real world. OOP uses several techniques from previously established paradigms,
    including modularity, polymorphism, and encapsulation." or "OOP languages typically
    are identified through their use of classes to create multiple objects that have
    the same properties and methods."'

    language. Yes, you are absolutely correct. Let''s see why it is an OOP language.

  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: We created an object for a person. We added few properties of person.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    property.

    `person` object. You can do this with the following method:'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To inherit means derive something (such as, characteristics, quality, and so
    on) from one's parents or ancestors. In programming languages, when a class or
    object is based on another class or object in order to maintain the same behavior
    of the parent class or object is known as **inheritance**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can also say that this is a concept of gaining properties or behaviors of
    something else.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Suppose, X inherits something from Y; it is like X is a type of Y.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: JavaScript occupies the inheritance capability. Let's take a look at an example.
    A bird inherits from an animal as a bird is a type of animal. Therefore, a bird
    can do the same thing that an animal does.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This kind of relationship in JavaScript is a little complex and needs a syntax.
    We need to use a special object called `prototype`, which assigns the properties
    to a type. We need to remember that only function has prototypes. Our `Animal`
    function should look similar to the following:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE3]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: 'To add a few properties of the function, we need to add a prototype as shown
    in the following:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE4]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: 'Let''s create prototypes for our `Bird` function. Our function and prototypes
    should look similar to the following:'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[PRE5]'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: The result of the prototypes and function is that any `Bird` that you create
    will have the properties of `Animal` and `Bird`. However, if you create `Animal`,
    this will only have the properties of `Animal`. The properties of `Animal` are
    inherited by `Bird`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, we can say that JavaScript has inheritance property.
  prefs: []

- en: Encapsulation in JavaScript
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In OOP, **encapsulation** is one of the most important concepts that allows
    an object to group the members of public and private classes under a single name.
    We use encapsulation to protect our classes against accidental or willful folly.
    Encapsulation means to enclose something in or as if something is in a capsule.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Now, we will see whether JavaScript supports encapsulation. If it does, we
    can say that JavaScript is an OOP language. Let''s take a look at the following
    example:'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    JavaScript is concerned, a variable can accept any type of data as its value.
    However, we don''t want a number in the place of a name. What do we do? We can
    use JavaScript''s encapsulation property, as follows:'
