This book explains the Three.js API and how to use it to build immersive online games. By the time you finish this book, you'll be able to reach millions of gamers through their web browsers, and you'll build exciting projects such as a first-person shooter along the way.</p><p>I've been building games for more than a decade. When I discovered Three.js, the first project I built was very similar to the first-person shooter game you'll build in <a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Exploring and Interacting">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Exploring and Interacting</em>. I was hooked by how quickly I could create fun games with no prior exposure to the library.</p><p>In <em>Game Development with Three.js</em>, I've tried to stay true to that exploratory spirit. I hope you have as much fun reading it as I had writing it.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p><a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Hello, Three.js">Chapter 1</a>,<em> Hello, Three.js</em>, describes what Three.js is and what it does, how to start writing code with it, and a basic scene.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Building a World">Chapter 2</a>,<em> Building a World</em>, explains the components of a Three.js scene including renderers, geometries, materials, and lighting for building a procedurally generated city.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Exploring and Interacting">Chapter 3</a>,<em> Exploring and Interacting</em>, explains mouse and keyboard interaction, basic physics, and creating a first-person shooter game.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Adding Detail">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Adding Detail</em>, explains particle systems, sound, graphic effects, and managing external assets such as 3D models in addition to building a capture-the-flag game.</p><p><a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Design and Development">Chapter 5</a>,<em> Design and Development</em>, describes game design for the web, including development processes, performance considerations, and the basics of networking.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "The <code class="literal">THREE</code> variable is global."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">renderer = new THREE.CanvasRenderer();
renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);</pre></div><p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();</strong>
renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);</pre></div><p><strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: "If you want to experiment with WebGL features that are still in development, you can enable some of them in Canary's <strong>about:flags</strong> page."</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip01"/>Tip</h3><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p></div></div></div>
