			<p>It's the start of the term and your physical and Google Classrooms are set up and ready for students to enter, and for learning to commence. While students simply walk into your physical classroom, sometimes with a school map in hand, in your virtual classroom, students must join the classroom from a computer or mobile device. As we mentioned in the <em class="italic">Preface</em>, Google Classroom excels in classrooms where computers or mobile devices are readily available or in an online environment. Furthermore, students will use the tool more frequently if it can be accessed from their own personal devices.</p>
			<p>Being the teacher, you may need to guide a class of students with different types of computers, tablets, and smart phones in installing and setting up Google Classroom. This chapter provides instructions for several different types of devices. We will explore the various methods of inviting students into a Google Classroom and managing those students within the class.</p>
			<p>Parts of this chapter have been written from a <strong class="bold">bring-your-own-device</strong> (<strong class="bold">BYOD</strong>) context, where students may bring a variety of devices to class and the teacher acts as technology support for the class. Some sections may appear repetitive, such as installing Google Chrome on Windows and then on macOS. If this is your first time using Google Classroom, reference the sections relevant to your devices and use the other sections when students require support.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Setting up Google Classroom on student's devices</li>
				<li>Allowing students to join using the class code</li>
				<li>Managing students in your class</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-28"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"/>Setting up Google Classroom on student's devices</h1>
			<p>Like <a id="_idIndexMarker052"/>all of Google's apps, Google Classroom can be accessed on any computer or mobile device that is connected to the internet. However, not every student will access Google Classroom from the same type of device. Therefore, it is important that you can help guide your students in setting up Google Classroom.</p>
			<p>The best time to invite students to Google Classroom is at the beginning of the term. During the first days of class, you will acclimatize your students to your classroom expectations and familiarize your students with the course's syllabus. Setting up student devices can easily be integrated into this process so that students are ready to use Google Classroom at the start of the term, reducing the chances of technical difficulties occurring later.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Choosing the best time to invite students to Google Classroom</p>
			<p class="callout">In general, I suggest inviting students to Google Classroom and ensuring all their devices are properly set up at the beginning of the term. However, this does not mean this has to be done on the first day. In Canadian high schools, students often have a couple of weeks to change their courses and thus change their timetable. Therefore, it may be more beneficial to wait until the majority of these changes are complete before you invite students to Google Classroom. It may save you having to make a lot of manual changes as the term progresses.</p>
			<p>When students set up their devices, have them set up Google Classroom on the device they will use to access it the most frequently. If your school already has a computer lab, mobile laptop, or Chromebook cart, your students will not need to set up those devices. For student populations with a high number of personal laptops, tablets, and smartphones, devoting class time to setting up their personal devices will increase student use of Google Classroom.</p>
			<p>Also, another great advantage of students using their personal tablets and phones is that the Google Classroom app on iOS and Android provides push notifications to those devices. Therefore, encourage your students to use the Google Classroom app on their smartphones so that they will always be notified whenever an announcement or assignment is posted in Google Classroom:</p>

			<p>This <a id="_idIndexMarker053"/>way, you do not have to worry about students checking their school issued emails for these notifications.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/>Setting up Chrome on computers and Chromebooks </h2>
			<p>Since <a id="_idIndexMarker054"/>Google Classroom and the rest of Google's G Suite for <a id="_idIndexMarker055"/>Education only requires an internet browser, all laptops that run Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, or Google's Chrome OS already have access to Google Classroom. While Microsoft Windows uses Microsoft Edge (or the older Internet Explorer) and Apple macOS uses Safari, Google develops and maintains its own internet browser – <strong class="bold">Google Chrome</strong>.</p>
			<p>Using Google's internet browser ensures the greatest compatibility with Google Classroom. Google's Chrome OS can be found on Chromebooks that already have Google Chrome installed; however, personal laptops used by students may not have Google Chrome installed.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Google's Chromebooks are <a id="_idIndexMarker056"/>the easiest to set up because they already have Google Chrome installed and set up, regardless of whether they are personal or school Chromebooks.</p>
			<p class="callout">Google Chrome can be installed on Windows or macOS computers without administrator privileges. Therefore, if a student does not have an administrator account on their personal device, the student can still install Google Chrome.</p>
			<h3>Installing Google Chrome on Microsoft Windows</h3>
			<p>To<a id="_idIndexMarker057"/> install Google Chrome on Microsoft Windows, follow <a id="_idIndexMarker058"/>these instructions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Open another web browser, such as <strong class="bold">Microsoft Edge</strong>:<div id="_idContainer056" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_2.2_B18646.jpg" alt="Figure 2.2 – Microsoft Edge icon&#13;&#10;" width="402" height="252"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.2 – Microsoft Edge icon</p></li>

				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Download Chrome</strong> button.</li>
				<li>A dialog<a id="_idIndexMarker065"/> box will appear, asking you to<a id="_idIndexMarker066"/> confirm whether to install an Intel chip version or an Apple chip version. As of November 2020, Apple switched to using their own chips in their computers. At the time of writing, most Apple computers still use Intel chips. You can follow the on-screen instructions under <strong class="bold">Check which version of Chrome to install</strong> to determine which download is correct. It will likely be the <strong class="bold">Mac with Intel chip</strong> button that you will use:<div id="_idContainer063" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_2.9_B18646.jpg" alt="Figure 2.9 – Chrome version install dialog box&#13;&#10;" width="764" height="438"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.9 – Chrome version install dialog box</p></li>
				<li>macOS <a id="_idIndexMarker067"/>may show a dialog box asking the<a id="_idIndexMarker068"/> user to confirm the download. An image of the dialog box is shown here.

			<h4>Installing Chrome without administration permissions</h4>
			<p>If a student does not have the password<a id="_idIndexMarker073"/> to the administration account, Google Chrome can still be installed on macOS. However, they will not be able to copy Google Chrome into the <strong class="source-inline">Applications</strong> folder. Instead, they can click and drag the <strong class="bold">Google Chrome</strong> icon to another location where the student's account has permission to save the files. One location is the Desktop in the student's account.</p>
			<h4>Adding a Google Chrome shortcut to the Dock</h4>
			<p>For quick<a id="_idIndexMarker074"/> access to Google Chrome, click and drag <a id="_idIndexMarker075"/>the <strong class="bold">Google Chrome</strong> icon from the <strong class="source-inline">Applications</strong> folder to the Dock.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">The first time a student launches Google Chrome, several dialog boxes will appear. These dialog boxes confirm opening a file that's been downloaded from the internet, as well as asking whether the student wants to set Google Chrome as their default browser (the browser opens whenever a link is clicked in another program).</p>
			<h3>Setting up Google Chrome</h3>
			<p>Once Google Chrome is <a id="_idIndexMarker076"/>installed, it must be linked to the student's account so that any bookmarks, Google Chrome apps, and extensions will sync with their personal computer. To complete the setup with Google Chrome, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Launch <strong class="bold">Google Chrome</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click on the user icon at the top-right corner of the browser:<div id="_idContainer067" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_2.13_B18646.jpg" alt="Figure 2.13 – User icon in Google Chrome&#13;&#10;" width="362" height="214"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.13 – User icon in Google Chrome</p><p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">If the student already has Chrome installed on their computer, they may also have sync turned on with a personal account. In this scenario, the student can either log out of their personal account or add the school account profile to Chrome.

			<p>Many <a id="_idIndexMarker080"/>students may also need assistance in setting up <a id="_idIndexMarker081"/>Google apps on their tablets and phones. Apart from downloading the apps from different app stores, installing Google Classroom is the same for Android and Apple iOS tablets and phones. For Google Classroom to function properly, additional Google apps are required.</p>
			<p>The following steps <a id="_idIndexMarker082"/>outline installing Google Classroom on either <a id="_idIndexMarker083"/>Android or iOS:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Open the app store on the mobile device. For Android, the app store is called <strong class="bold">Play Store</strong> (left); for iOS, the app store is called <strong class="bold">App Store</strong> (right):<div id="_idContainer073" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_2.19_B18646.jpg" alt="Figure 2.19 – Application managers on Google Android and Apple iOS&#13;&#10;" width="1024" height="199"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.19 – Application managers on Google Android and Apple iOS</p></li>

			<p>For <a id="_idIndexMarker090"/>Android devices (such as tablets and phones), many of<a id="_idIndexMarker091"/> these additional apps are already installed.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Guiding students in using the classroom projector</p>
			<p class="callout">When guiding students in installing Google Classroom and additional Google apps, connecting a mobile device to the classroom projector can help the students with the installation process. Android devices may have built-in screencasting tools such as MHL or Miracast, whereas iOS devices can use an HDMI adapter to connect directly to a projector or third-party software such as AirServer. Middle and high school students most likely already have experience in installing apps on their mobile devices. Therefore, displaying which apps are needed on the projector is most likely all that is required to ensure that the students install all the necessary apps.</p>
			<p>Now that <a id="_idIndexMarker092"/>the students have the appropriate apps to use Google <a id="_idIndexMarker093"/>Classroom on their computers and mobile devices, it is time for your students to join your Google Classroom.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-31"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"/>Allowing students to join using the class code</h1>
			<p>Students can <a id="_idIndexMarker094"/>join specific classes in Google Classroom using Class codes, invite links, or by you manually inviting students to individual classes. Class codes are a combination of letters and numbers that identify the unique class in Google Classroom, whereas invite links are internet hyperlinks. Any student with a school email can join your classroom if they have access to either the class code or the invite link.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">A student can use any device to join a classroom. Furthermore, once the student has joined your classroom on a device, they will be able to access your classroom from any other device where they have logged in with their school email.</p>

			<p class="callout-heading">Display the class codes in your physical classroom</p>
			<p class="callout">At the beginning of the term, display your Class codes in your classroom so that any students who are added to your classroom later can easily join. A corner of a whiteboard or bulletin board is an excellent location for this.</p>
			<p>Using <a id="_idIndexMarker103"/>Class codes is the only method where students can self-enroll in a Class. For extra-curricular activities such as clubs and sports, teachers can create classes that manage those activities. In such situations, posting the <strong class="bold">Class code</strong> number on bulletin boards or other in-school communications is an easy way for students to sign up!</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"/>Inviting students to your Class with an invite link</h2>
			<p>If you have<a id="_idIndexMarker104"/> students such as primary students, who have challenges in typing a series of numbers and letters correctly, emailing an invite link that they can click on may be an easier solution. Use the following steps to find the invite link:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>, click on the full-screen icon beside the <strong class="bold">Class code</strong> number in the Class banner:<div id="_idContainer088" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_2.34_B18646.jpg" alt="Figure 2.34 – Full-screen icon in the Classroom banner&#13;&#10;" width="473" height="192"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.34 – Full-screen icon in the Classroom banner</p></li>
				<li>Click on <strong class="bold">Copy invite link</strong>: <div id="_idContainer089" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_2.35_B18646.jpg" alt="Figure 2.35 – The Copy invite link icon in the class code dialog box&#13;&#10;" width="758" height="252"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.35 – The Copy invite link icon in the class code dialog box</p></li>
				<li>Now that the link has been copied, you can send it to your students through your school's communication system. My division uses an internal digital bulletin board to post messages to students and parents; however, something as simple as<a id="_idIndexMarker105"/> emailing your students the link will allow students to join the class with the invite link. </li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>Making changes to the class code and invite link</h2>
			<p>Once all your <a id="_idIndexMarker106"/>students have joined your classrooms, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker107"/>prevent other students from joining your classes by either resetting or disabling the <strong class="bold">Class code</strong> number and <strong class="bold">invite link</strong>. Resetting both will generate a new code and hyperlink for students to use to join your classroom. This change will not affect the students already within your classroom.</p>
			<p>Disabling the <strong class="bold">Class code</strong> number and <strong class="bold">invite link</strong> will prevent students from joining the class; however, you will still be able to manually invite students by going to the <strong class="bold">People</strong> tab of the class, shown later in this chapter. To reset or disable the <strong class="bold">Class code</strong> number and <strong class="bold">invite link</strong>, follow these instructions:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In Classroom, click on the settings gear in the top-right corner:<div id="_idContainer090" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_2.36_B18646.jpg" alt="Figure 2.36 – Settings gear in Google Classroom&#13;&#10;" width="895" height="83"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.36 – Settings gear in Google Classroom</p></li>
				<li>Scroll down to the <strong class="bold">General</strong> section and click on the dropdown menu for <strong class="bold">Manage invite codes</strong>. Select either <strong class="bold">Turn off</strong> or <strong class="bold">Reset</strong>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer091" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.37 – The manage invite codes dropdown menu</p>
			<p>You can <a id="_idIndexMarker108"/>display the <strong class="bold">Class code</strong> full-screen dialog box or <a id="_idIndexMarker109"/>copy the required <strong class="bold">Invite link</strong> from the settings too!</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Managing class codes and invite links on mobile</p>
			<p class="callout">The Google Classroom app also displays a settings gear at the top of the Class <strong class="bold">Stream</strong> where you can copy, reset, or disable the <strong class="bold">Class code</strong> and invite link. Tapping the <strong class="bold">Class code</strong> or invite link will automatically copy them. You can reset or disable them by going to the menu beside <strong class="bold">Student invitation settings</strong> rather than <strong class="bold">Manage invite codes</strong>.</p>
			<p>Now that we have seen various ways students can join your class, let's explore how to manage them.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-35"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>Managing students in your Class</h1>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker110"/>full class list <a id="_idIndexMarker111"/>of all students can be found on the <strong class="bold">Students</strong> page of your classroom. Here, you can make changes to the students within your classroom, as well as send emails to individual students or to the entire class.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-36"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"/>Manually inviting students to your Class</h2>
			<p>When <a id="_idIndexMarker112"/>students are added to your class late in the term <a id="_idIndexMarker113"/>or a student is having difficulties joining with a <strong class="bold">Class code</strong> or <strong class="bold">invite link</strong>, you can manually invite students to your classes. You should use this method as a last resort because manually adding several dozen students to a class is tedious and time-consuming. Follow these instructions to manually invite a student to your class:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In Google Classroom, click on the <strong class="bold">People</strong> tab from the main menu and click on the <strong class="bold">Invite students</strong> icon on the <strong class="bold">Students</strong> heading:<div id="_idContainer092" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_2.38_B18646.jpg" alt="Figure 2.38 – Invite students icon&#13;&#10;" width="574" height="217"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.38 – Invite students icon</p></li>
				<li>Type in the name or email address of the student you want to invite. Google will autocomplete this with any contacts in your Gmail's <strong class="bold">My Contacts</strong> and any directory, such as the school district's staff and student directory. Select the required student from the <strong class="bold">SEARCH RESULTS</strong> area:<div id="_idContainer093" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_2.39_B18646.jpg" alt="Figure 2.39 – Student contact found in SEARCH RESULTS&#13;&#10;" width="517" height="342"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.39 – Student contact found in SEARCH RESULTS</p></li>
				<li>Repeat <em class="italic">step 2</em> to invite <a id="_idIndexMarker114"/>additional students. Once all the <a id="_idIndexMarker115"/>students have been selected, click the <strong class="bold">Invite</strong> link:<div id="_idContainer094" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_2.40_B18646.jpg" alt="Figure 2.40 – Invite link&#13;&#10;" width="528" height="373"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.40 – Invite link</p><p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">Whenever possible, use an email address instead of the name of the student. Large districts will have several students with the same first and last names. For a few years, there was a student named Michael Zhang at my school. There were several incidents where emails were not sent to the correct recipient.</p></li>
				<li>Once you've<a id="_idIndexMarker116"/> invited the student, the student will <a id="_idIndexMarker117"/>appear grayed out until they accept the invite:<div id="_idContainer095" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_2.41_B18646.jpg" alt="Figure 2.41 – Invited student who has not joined the Class&#13;&#10;" width="514" height="87"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.41 – Invited student who has not joined the Class</p></li>
				<li>The student will need to accept the invitation by clicking the link in the email invitation or logging into Google Classroom from a computer/Chromebook (left) or mobile device (right) and clicking or tapping on the <strong class="bold">Join</strong> button:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer096" class="IMG---Figure">

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.42 – Join button on Google Chrome and the Classroom app </p>
			<p>Another rare situation where you may need to manually invite a student to your class is if the student unenrolls from the class. Students can unenroll themselves from a class from the Home screen of Google Classroom. At the time of writing, there is no way of disabling this feature for students:</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-37"><a id="_idTextAnchor036"/>Removing students from your classroom</h2>
			<p>When students withdraw from your class, you will also need to remove them from your class in Google<a id="_idIndexMarker118"/> Classroom. While this is not mandatory, the withdrawn student will still receive announcements and assignments through Google Classroom if they are still enrolled in your class. Follow these steps to remove a student:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In Google Classroom, click on the <strong class="bold">People</strong> tab:<div id="_idContainer098" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_2.44_B18646.jpg" alt="Figure 2.44 – The People tab&#13;&#10;" width="668" height="107"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.44 – The People tab</p></li>
				<li>Click on the checkbox beside the student. (You can also select additional students if you need to remove multiple students.) Then, click on the <strong class="bold">Actions</strong> drop-down menu:<div id="_idContainer099" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_2.45_B18646.jpg" alt="Figure 2.45 – Selecting students in the People tab&#13;&#10;" width="460" height="376"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.45 – Selecting students in the People tab</p></li>
				<li>Select <a id="_idIndexMarker119"/>the <strong class="bold">Remove</strong> option:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer100" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_2.46_B18646.jpg" alt="Figure 2.46 – Remove option in the Actions menu&#13;&#10;" width="433" height="400"/>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.46 – Remove option in the Actions menu</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-38"><a id="_idTextAnchor037"/>Emailing students in your classroom</h2>
			<p>When you need to<a id="_idIndexMarker120"/> communicate with an individual or small group <a id="_idIndexMarker121"/>of students, you can send an email directly from Google Classroom. However, Google Classroom has an <strong class="bold">Announcement</strong> feature for when you need to communicate with the entire class. This <strong class="bold">Announcement</strong> feature will be discussed in <a href="B16846_03_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor040"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Sending Your First Announcement</em>.</p>
			<p>To email students from Google Classroom, follow the steps in the previous section. Instead of selecting <strong class="bold">Remove</strong>, select <strong class="bold">Email</strong>; a new email message window will appear addressed to the selected students.</p>
			<p>If you are<a id="_idIndexMarker122"/> emailing a single student, the Kebab menu beside<a id="_idIndexMarker123"/> each student in the <strong class="bold">People</strong> tab has an email option you can use, as shown here:</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-39"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>If this is your first time inviting students to your virtual classroom, the steps in this chapter may appear daunting. However, through past experience, today's middle and high school students already have a proficient understanding of technology and will complete these tasks quickly. When I teach with Google Classroom, the setup process only takes about 15 minutes with high school students. This chapter has provided you with the tools for those students that have never used Google Classroom, which, as the years go by, will decrease.</p>
			<p>You are now able to install Google Chrome on Windows or Apple computers, as well as guide students in installing Google Classroom and other Google apps on their mobile devices. You can display the <strong class="bold">Class Code</strong> number to allow students to join your classes, as well as manually invite or remove students with an invite link or through Google Classroom as needed. Finally, you can email students directly from Google Classroom.</p>
			<p>This chapter recommended that you only email students individually or in small groups. In the next chapter, you will explore using the <strong class="bold">Announcement</strong> feature to communicate with your entire class.</p>
