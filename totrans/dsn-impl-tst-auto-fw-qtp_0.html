HP QuickTest Professional supports keyword and scripting interfaces and features a graphical user interface. It uses the Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript) to specify a test procedure and to manipulate the objects and controls of the application under testing.</p><p>This book is a great platform for sharing my knowledge of designing and implementing the test automation framework that I have acquired over the years, while working in Information Technology and teaching QTP to professionals. If any professional or student finds it difficult to implement frameworks, this is the right book—one which teaches approaches and concepts with simple examples. This book covers the managerial, technical, and design concepts, and is uniquely designed to deliver the knowledge needed to create an effective framework. It demonstrates easy ways to implement and learn concepts, along with code and suggestions for creating a portable framework across various versions of QTP.</p><p>This book also covers the new features for creating test automation using XPath in QTP and JavaScript for automated web applications.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Automation Life Cycle and Automation Goals">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Automation Life Cycle and Automation Goals</em></span>, explains the automation life cycle and tool selection which helps to implement better processes for test automation and tool selection. This chapter also explains the overall automation and design goals that help develop a better test automation framework and guides you towards implementing better practices to achieve maximum output.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Essentials of Automation">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Essentials of Automation</em></span>, explains the key elements for designing test automation using QTP along with examples on how to use each of them. These elements serve as the base to create a complete test automation script.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Basic Building Blocks for Creating Frameworks">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Basic Building Blocks for Creating Frameworks</em></span>, explains the basic code-building blocks (with examples) for designing the implementation of test automation frameworks, all of which are used in implementing the framework(s).</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Understanding and Creating Frameworks">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Understanding and Creating Frameworks</em></span>, explains what we mean by test automation frameworks and what types of frameworks exist. It guides you towards understanding these frameworks before we design and implement them. The chapter will also highlight the differences and commonalities among them.</p><p>It explains the basics of test automation frameworks and builds the user's maturity in implementing test automation framework(s) end-to-end.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Deploying and Maintaining Frameworks">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Deploying and Maintaining Frameworks</em></span>, explains, in the beginning of the design phase, how and what needs to be done to maintain and enhance these frameworks with ease.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. DOM- and XPath-based Framework in Web Applications">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>DOM- and XPath-based Framework in Web Applications</em></span>, explains the various web-based technologies and builds the maturity to implement these technologies for automated web-based applications. It explains HTML, XPath, DOM, JavaScript, and how to use them effectively for creating test automation scripts.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Capturing the Lessons Learned">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Capturing the Lessons Learned</em></span>, explains what should be captured for lessons to be learned and how to make sure that these lessons help in future projects or serve as input in other projects.</p></div></div>
