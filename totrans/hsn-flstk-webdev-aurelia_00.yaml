- en: A few years ago, it was very common to find several IT professionals specialized
    in just one kind of technology, code language or platform. People dedicated to
    reviewing all the backend stuff thought that they do not have anything to do with
    the frontend layer, after all one is developed in Java and C# and the other in
    HTML and JavaScript. This approach was not good. As times change, we need to start
    understanding that one application involves not only one part of the business,
    such as logistic or sales. Your application should involve the entire business
    and represent it on a binary world with same features, restrictions, and rules.
    As only a backend developer, your understanding of how data is displayed to the
    final user is very limited. As just a frontend developer, your knowledge of how
    many distributed applications interact and retrieve data to be interpreted on
    the screen is very limited too. As a first consequence, the development time increases
    and the product quality is not the desired one. Many IT professionals are now
    leaving their comfort zone and exploring the other side. A full stack developer
    is not only a developer with knowledge of backend and frontend languages. A full
    stack developer is a professional capable of understanding and translating each
    business requirement into application features, knowing the general impact and
    the changes it could include. Their diagnostic and time duration required to deliver
    will be always shorter to reality because they know exactly how the current product
    works, with external dependencies and different platforms.

    it is not enough to have a good knowledge of just one code language. NoSQL databases
    changed the relational paradigm, and strict object-oriented languages are now
    exploring the functional paradigm. These things enforces you to start understanding
    different programming paradigms, code languages, and frameworks. But there is
    one language that from its beginning, the only thing it did is grow: JavaScript.'

    and start understanding how this code language works and why it is so adopted
    by the community. JavaScript could be used as an object-oriented language or function
    too. Its flexibility is one of its most awesome features, and the development
    speed is faster compared with other traditional programming languages. Not only
    this, JavaScript was empowered with their own runtime platform outside the browser,
    NodeJS. In this book, you will find that Node is our main partner to develop JavaScript
    applications, and its simplicity to include external libraries and reuse code
    is simply awesome.

    be also explained and will give you the knowledge to participate in any development
    team, understand and propose new features. Our horse battle, Aurelia, will be
    present in this stage. You must have heard about popular frontend frameworks,
    such as Angular, or libraries, such as React. Aurelia comes with a very different
    approach, solving most of the common problems you would find and, of course, making
    your development process very easy. Forget about configuring the framework and
    your worries about data binding, AJAX calls, integration with third-party libraries,
    and so on, Aurelia comes with a big variety of plugins that are ready to help
    you in any situation, in a very simple way, and allows you to focus only on business
    code. Aurelia is not just another frontend framework, it is the future of frontend
    development.

    approach has changed too. The fact that we can execute our JavaScript code in
    its own runtime environment allows us to start writing backend functionalities
    to be consumed for the frontend layer. ExpressJS is the backend framework based
    on NodeJS that will allow us to write our business processing data functionalities
    in a very simple way, high understandable and just with a few lines of code. To
    complete your travel through the backend layer, we will show you how to store
    data in one of the most famous NoSQL databases: MongoDB. Its simplicity and speed
    to insert and extract data are just amazing.'
