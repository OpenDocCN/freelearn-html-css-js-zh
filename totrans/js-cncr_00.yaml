- en: 'It wasn''t long ago when I would dread using many of the web applications I
    had come to depend on. When they worked, they were fantastic; when they didn''t,
    it was a nightmare. Especially frustrating was the clear fact that there weren''t
    any bugs in the JavaScript code driving the application. No, the problem was that
    often there was too much code running, perhaps because it was processing a large
    data set. The end result was always the same: the UI would freeze, and I would
    helplessly curse the Web.'

- en: Nowadays, this doesn't happen as frequently. We've fixed many of the common
    JavaScript problems from years ago. Something that hasn't caught on as fast as
    I had hoped is concurrency in JavaScript. There are little bits of concurrency
    sprinkled all throughout our applications, but seldom do we see truly concurrent
    JavaScript code.
