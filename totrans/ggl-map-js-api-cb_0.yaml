- en: Currently, there are both open source and proprietary alternatives to the Google
    Maps JavaScript API, but what makes the API special for developers is that it
    is a complete solution with base maps, overlays, and technical capabilities.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The API has been especially exciting for developers because it is very easy
    to build up generic outcomes, and at the same time, it has its own tips and tricks
    and advanced functionalities within the same box. Therefore, you can swim afloat
    or dive deep when you are working with the API.

- en: The Google Maps JavaScript API v3 enabled the quick and easy development of
    mobile scenarios, facilitating location-based solution developers to delve into
    the subject. Regarding the growth of mobile development, especially location-based
    applications, the Google Maps JavaScript API v3 has deserved rightful attention.

- en: Last but not least, no mapping API has ever been as successful as the Google
    Maps API without the support of continuously updated and thoroughly handled vector
    and satellite data. Google has dedicated immense resources to maintaining the
    unified structure of the vector data and its cartographic quality, and this effort
    is paying off in terms of its API usage.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Google Maps JavaScript API Basics"), *Google
    Maps JavaScript API Basics*, instructs you on how to create a simple Google Maps
    application centered around a main recipe. The map object and its primary options,
    including map types, will be introduced by adding details to the recipe.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Adding Raster Layers"), *Adding Raster Layers*,
    presents the addition of external raster data through a series of recipes alongside
    Google layers such as the Tile, Traffic, Transit, and Weather layers.'

    introduces you to drawing vector features together with the display of external
    vector sources such as KML and GeoRSS.'

    explains controls in detail. Creating and customizing a custom user interface
    for both the Web and mobile will be introduced in this chapter.'

    Events"), *Understanding Google Maps JavaScript API Events*, describes events
    in detail to react to map, layer, or marker''s behaviors such as zoom end, layer
    changed, or marker added. Events will add more interactivity to mapping programming.'

    Maps JavaScript Libraries*, explains the libraries that will extend the capabilities
    of the Google Maps JavaScript API in detail. These libraries have different abilities
    to increase the power of the Google Maps JavaScript API.'

    elaborates on services that will extend the Google Maps JavaScript API. These
    services, including Geocoding and Street View, expose the real power of mapping
    with the Google Maps JavaScript API.'

    through Advanced Recipes"), *Mastering the Google Maps JavaScript API through
    Advanced Recipes*, explains the integration of external GIS servers and services
    with the Google Maps JavaScript API. These includes ArcGIS Server, GeoServer,
    CartoDB, and Google Fusion Tables with OGC services such as WMS.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Google Maps JavaScript API works with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. So,
    a text editor with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS handling capabilities will be a good
    friend while exploring this book.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For Mac users, there are lots of commercial or free text editors, such as TextWrangler,
    BBEdit, Sublime Text, or WebStorm. They all handle HTML, JavaScript, and CSS beautifully.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For Windows users, there are different text editors as well, but Notepad++ is
    the most used and recommended one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Choosing an editor depends on your computer's habits, so there is no exact solution
    or recommendation for users to select one editor. Everyone has a different perception
    that affects these choices.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is also need for an HTTP server to implement these recipes. There are
    a bunch of HTTP servers including Apache, IIS, and so on. But the installation
    process of standalone servers can be a problem for most users. We encourage you
    to use solutions that bundle HTTP Server, Database Server, and a scripting language
    together. XAMPP and MAMP are these kinds of solutions for the Windows and Mac
    OS X platforms respectively.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For better user experience, we have created a main application that allows the
    desired recipe to run and show its source code. Suppose you have installed and
    configured a local web server like XAMPP or MAMP, and the bundle code is copied
    within the HTTP server root content folder in the `googlemaps-cookbook` folder,
    the user can run the main application by accessing the `http://localhost/googlemaps-cookbook/index.html`
    URL in the browser.

- en: This book is great for developers who are interested in adding a simple contact
    map embedded in their websites as well as for those who wish to develop real-world
    complex GIS applications. It is also for those who want to create map-based info
    graphics, such as heat maps, from their geo-related data. It's assumed that you
    will have some experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript already, and also experience
    in simple concepts related to GIS and prior knowledge of some GIS servers or services.
