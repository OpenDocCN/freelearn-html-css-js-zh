- en: There has been a rapid increase in the use of JavaScript in hardware and embedded
    device programming. JavaScript has an effective set of frameworks and libraries
    that support the robotics ecosystem.

- en: Hands-On Robotics with JavaScript starts with setting up an environment to program
    robots in JavaScript. Then, you will dive into building basic-level projects such
    as a line-following robot. You will walk through a series of projects that will
    teach you about the Johnny-Five library, and develop your skills with each project.
    As you make your way through the chapters, you'll work on creating a blinking
    LED, before moving on to sensors and other more advanced concepts. You will then
    progress to building an advanced-level AI-enabled robot, connect their NodeBots
    to the internet, create a NodeBots Swarm, and explore MQTT.

- en: '[Chapter 1](bab2feb9-9667-4f8b-bb2e-1702009b87b4.xhtml), *Setting Up Your Development
    Environment*, this chapter covers the Raspberry Pi and how to use and set it up.
    This includes setting up raspbian on an SD card, installing Node.js, installing
    the Johnny-Five library, and installing the Raspi-IO library. The chapter will
    also explain the overarching concepts of Johnny-Five and Raspi-IO, as well as
    the benefits programming robotics in JavaScript brings.'

    Johnny-Five Project*, in this chapter, the reader will build their development
    environment for their Johnny-Five projects, and create their first Johnny-Five
    project: a blinking LED'

    Projects with RGB LED*, in this chapter, readers will be introduced to digital
    and PWM IO pins via LEDs–they will create a couple of projects with multiple LEDs
    and an RGB LED and explore fully the Johnny-Five LED API. We will also look at
    including outside Node.js libraries by including the color library to control
    the color of the RGB LED.'

    to Create a Night-Light*, in this chapter, we will add a sensor and create our
    first practical project: a night-light! The night-light will work by reading from
    the light sensor and if it''s bright in the room, leave an LED off, but if it''s
    dark, light it up! We''ll also discuss the role sensors play in the robotics project
    ecosystem.'

    motors. This includes the extra hardware you will need for your project to be
    powered properly, how to wire motors to your project, the johnny-five motor API,
    and troubleshooting common problems when it comes to using motors with the Raspberry

    projects with the servo, and build a servo that responds to a sensor. Readers
    will learn about servos and the Johnny-Five servo API, as well as build o project
    with one. They will also learn about the differences between servos and motors
    in the context of making robotics projects that move.'

    the animation library is a great way to fine-tune control over your johnny-five
    servo projects by controlling the speed, acceleration curve, and start and end
    points of your servo''s movement. In this chapter, we''ll look at the animation
    library and walk through how to control precision servo movements.'

    NodeBots projects to the internet. We''ll start by looking at ways you can use
    GET requests to obtain information from websites; like weather forecasts for your
    area. We''ll build our first internet-connected bot using weather data and an
    RGB LED.'
