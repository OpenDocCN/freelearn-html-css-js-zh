			<h1 id="_idParaDest-41"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/>Chapter 3</em>: Sending Your First Announcement</h1>
			<p>Now that your online classroom is set up in Google Classroom and your students are enrolled in their classes, you can begin using Google Classroom's features to communicate with your students. One of the simplest forms of communicating with students within your classroom is to send <strong class="bold">announcements</strong>. Announcements in Google Classroom is like sending your class an email (in fact, when you create an announcement, students also receive an email containing the necessary information).</p>
			<p>For announcements, you can add files from your computer or Google Drive, and even add links to websites or YouTube videos, just like we did with the <strong class="bold">Material</strong> post in <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong>, which we discussed in <a href="B16846_01_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Getting to Know Google Classroom</em>. Students can even reply to your announcements directly from the classroom's <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>. An <strong class="bold">Announcement</strong> is a type of post that appears in this <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>. Using announcements in Google Classroom instead of sending emails also makes it easier to find announcements in the future and use them in other classes.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Sending and receiving announcements</li>
				<li>Parts of an announcement</li>
				<li>Replying to announcements</li>
				<li>Editing announcements</li>
				<li>Reusing announcements</li>
				<li>Authorizing and managing students in the Stream</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-42"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/>Creating an announcement</h1>
			<p>An announcement <a id="_idIndexMarker124"/>appears at the top of the classroom's <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>. Whenever new <strong class="bold">Announcement</strong> posts or <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> notifications are added to the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>, they will be added to the top of the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>. Therefore, older posts in the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong> are moved lower down the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>, but they are not deleted.</p>
			<p>To create an announcement, go to the desired classroom and follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Click on the box at the top of the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>. The field will say <strong class="bold">Announce something to your class</strong> before you click it:<div id="_idContainer108" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_3.1_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.1 – Create Announcement box&#13;&#10;" width="971" height="229"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.1 – Create Announcement box</p></li>
				<li>Type your <a id="_idIndexMarker125"/>announcement into the field. The field will say <strong class="bold">Announce something to your class</strong> before you type your message. Rich text formatting buttons will appear at the bottom of the text field to bold, italicize, underline and bullet text:<div id="_idContainer109" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_3.2_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.2 – An announcement box&#13;&#10;" width="862" height="389"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.2 – An announcement box</p><p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">Late in the production of this book, rich text formatting was added to all posts. While the above image was updated before print, all other images of <strong class="bold">Announcement</strong>, <strong class="bold">Question</strong>, <strong class="bold">Assignment</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Material</strong> posts within this book do not have the rich text formatting buttons in their text fields.</p></li>
				<li>If you would like to post this announcement in multiple classes at the same time, click on the name of the class to select the additional classes:<div id="_idContainer110" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_3.3_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.3 – Class drop-down menu&#13;&#10;" width="445" height="279"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.3 – Class drop-down menu</p></li>
				<li>Click <a id="_idIndexMarker126"/>the <strong class="bold">Post</strong> button when you are ready to post:<div id="_idContainer111" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_3.4_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.4 – The Post button&#13;&#10;" width="401" height="84"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.4 – The Post button</p></li>
				<li>Click the <strong class="bold">Post</strong> button in the confirmation dialog box:</li>
			</ol>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.5 – Confirmation dialog box</p>
			<p>If you are not ready to post the announcement, you can save it as a draft by clicking on the drop-down menu beside the <strong class="bold">Post</strong> button and selecting <strong class="bold">Save draft</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer113" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.7 – Announcement drafts save location</p>
			<p>While saving posts as drafts is a useful way of preparing for classes, there are several instances where you may want to schedule a post to be released on a certain date and time instead.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>Scheduling a time to publish an announcement</h2>
			<p>Teachers <a id="_idIndexMarker128"/>can schedule when Google Classroom will publish a post. This feature allows you to set up announcements, questions, assignments, materials, or quizzes and post them at appropriate times during the lesson. A simple example of utilizing this feature is posting a <strong class="bold">Question</strong> post as <strong class="bold">Do Now at the start of class</strong>, followed by another <strong class="bold">Question</strong> or <strong class="bold">Assignment</strong> post halfway through the lesson to assess the students' understanding, and then ending the lesson with an <strong class="bold">Assignment</strong> post containing practice questions. To schedule a post, from the drop-down menu of the <strong class="bold">Post</strong> button, select <strong class="bold">Schedule</strong>, as shown here:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer115" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.8_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.8 – Selecting Schedule&#13;&#10;" width="489" height="227"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.8 – Selecting Schedule</p>
			<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker129"/>screenshot shows the dialog box you must use to set the date and time when Google Classroom will publish the post. Clicking on the <strong class="bold">Schedule</strong> button confirms the publishing time and saves the post:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer116" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.9_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.9 – Schedule announcement dialog box&#13;&#10;" width="303" height="267"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.9 – Schedule announcement dialog box</p>
			<p>Just like drafts, scheduled posts appear in the <strong class="bold">Saved Announcements</strong> section, above the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/>Advanced features in announcements</h2>
			<p>Announcements <a id="_idIndexMarker130"/>can communicate more than a simple text message. Some additional features of an announcement include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Attaching a file from your computer </li>
				<li>Attaching a file from Google Drive</li>
				<li>Including a YouTube video</li>
				<li>Including a link to a website<p class="callout-heading">When to add resources to the Stream or to the About sections</p><p class="callout">You may have already noticed that these options are also present in the <strong class="bold">Materials</strong> post described in <a href="B16846_01_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Getting to Know Google Classroom</em>. Adding files to specific posts instead of a <strong class="bold">Material</strong> in the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> section indicates that the included resources are for the specific post in the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong> instead of for the class in general. Posts will move lower down the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong> faster than they will in the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> section. Therefore, resources attached in the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong> are for short-term tasks, whereas resources attached in the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> section are for the duration of the class.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following diagram shows where many of these features are in the announcements dialog box when you're creating an announcement:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer117" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.10_B16846.jpg" alt="" width="784" height="647"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.10 – Overview of Announcement post options</p>
			<p>We will <a id="_idIndexMarker131"/>have a look at each of these features in the following sections.</p>
			<h3>Attaching a file from your computer</h3>
			<p>When <a id="_idIndexMarker132"/>you attach a file from your computer to a post, the file will be available to the students when they view the announcement. Follow these steps to attach a file from your computer when creating an announcement:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Click on the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> menu in the announcement dialog box and then select <strong class="bold">File</strong>:<div id="_idContainer118" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_3.11_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.11 – File option in the Add menu&#13;&#10;" width="349" height="353"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.11 – File option in the Add menu</p></li>
				<li>Click <a id="_idIndexMarker133"/>on the <strong class="bold">Browse</strong> button of the dialog box:<div id="_idContainer119" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_3.12_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.12 – Upload dialog box&#13;&#10;" width="420" height="290"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.12 – Upload dialog box</p></li>
				<li>Navigate to the desired file and click the <strong class="bold">Open</strong> button:<div id="_idContainer120" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_3.13_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.13 – File Explorer dialog box&#13;&#10;" width="611" height="270"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.13 – File Explorer dialog box</p></li>
				<li>Click <a id="_idIndexMarker134"/>on the <strong class="bold">Post</strong> button of the <strong class="bold">Create Announcement</strong> dialog box to post an announcement, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer121" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.14_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.14 – Announcement with file attachment&#13;&#10;" width="741" height="421"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.14 – Announcement with file attachment</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">To add multiple files, repeat the preceding steps to add additional files before clicking on the <strong class="bold">Post</strong> button.</p>
			<p class="callout">Files that are uploaded are stored in the <strong class="bold">My Drive</strong> folder in Google Drive, just like the files that are uploaded in the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> page.</p>
			<h3>Attaching a file from Google Drive</h3>
			<p>Attaching <a id="_idIndexMarker135"/>a file from Google Drive is like attaching a file from your computer. The steps are as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Click on the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> menu in the announcement dialog box and then select <strong class="bold">File</strong>:<div id="_idContainer122" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_3.15_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.15 – Google Drive option in the Add menu&#13;&#10;" width="385" height="282"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.15 – Google Drive option in the Add menu</p></li>
				<li>Navigate to the desired file in Google Drive. Select the file and then click the <strong class="bold">INSERT</strong> link at the bottom of the dialog box:<div id="_idContainer123" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_3.16_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.16 – Inserting a file from Google Drive&#13;&#10;" width="962" height="561"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.16 – Inserting a file from Google Drive</p></li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Post</strong> button of the <strong class="bold">Create Announcement</strong> dialog box to post an announcement.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Including a YouTube video</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">YouTube</strong> dialog <a id="_idIndexMarker136"/>box appears when you click on the <strong class="bold">YouTube</strong> option in the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> drop - down menu. From the <strong class="bold">Insert video</strong> dialog box, you can search for and add a specific video:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer124" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.17_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.17 – Searching for a YouTube video&#13;&#10;" width="892" height="558"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.17 – Searching for a YouTube video</p>
			<p>If you have already saved the video on YouTube, another method is to copy the YouTube address and paste it into the field of the <strong class="bold">URL</strong> tab:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer125" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.18_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.18 – The URL tab of Insert Video&#13;&#10;" width="991" height="616"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.18 – The URL tab of Insert Video</p>
			<p>Once the <a id="_idIndexMarker137"/>YouTube video file has been added, it will appear at the bottom of the post, just like the file attachment did in the previous section.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Including video files in a post</p>
			<p class="callout">At first glance, Google Classroom does not appear to play videos that have already been saved to <a id="_idIndexMarker138"/>your computer. However, Google Drive uses a built-in video player such as YouTube. Therefore, you can attach a video file to a post and students will be able to watch the video. Google Drive has a 5-terabyte file size limit and can play <strong class="source-inline">WebM</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">mpeg4</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">mp4</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">3gpp</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">mov</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">avi</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">mpegps</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">wmv</strong>, <strong class="source-inline">flv</strong>, and <strong class="source-inline">mts</strong> video files.</p>
			<h3>Including a link to a website</h3>
			<p>Before we <a id="_idIndexMarker139"/>move on, let's quickly see how we can include a website link in the post. After clicking on the <strong class="bold">Link</strong> option in the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> dropdown, a dialog box will appear. Paste the URL and click on <strong class="bold">Add link</strong>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer126" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.19_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.19 – Add link dialog box&#13;&#10;" width="529" height="320"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.19 – Add link dialog box</p>
			<p>The link and a small thumbnail of the web page will appear at the bottom of the post.</p>
			<p>With the <a id="_idIndexMarker140"/>ability to add so many resources to an <strong class="bold">Announcement</strong> post, it is easy to publish a post before including all the necessary attachments. (For me, it is almost a weekly occurrence.) The next section will guide you through editing an already published post.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor044"/>Making changes to an announcement in the Stream</h1>
			<p>You may <a id="_idIndexMarker141"/>need to make changes or outright <a id="_idIndexMarker142"/>delete an announcement or another type of post once the post has been published to the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>. Each post has a vertical line of three dots, indicating a menu of actions that can be performed on the post:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer127" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.20_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.20 – Kebab menu in an Announcement post&#13;&#10;" width="829" height="149"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.20 – Kebab menu in an Announcement post</p>
			<p>From this menu, you will be able to perform the following actions on the announcement (or any other type of post) in the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Move to top</strong> will place the announcement at the top of the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Edit</strong> will allow you to make changes to the announcement.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Delete</strong> will remove the post and all comments and attachments associated with the post from the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Copy Link</strong> will provide a direct link to the post. This feature is the most useful when you're sending a student to an announcement lower in the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Teachers <a id="_idIndexMarker143"/>and co-teachers can move to the <a id="_idIndexMarker144"/>top, edit, and delete each other's posts.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Emphasizing specific posts with Move to Top</p>
			<p class="callout">Keeping specific posts at the top of the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong> will help remind students of important announcements. These announcements may include reminders for school-wide events, deadlines, and field trip forms.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>Reusing a previously created announcement</h2>
			<p>Your classes may not be learning at the same pace. Therefore, you may have a class that needs <a id="_idIndexMarker145"/>the same post as a faster-paced class. Instead of retyping or copying and pasting that information, Google Classroom provides a feature that copies an entire post from one class and reposts it in another class. Follow these steps to reuse a post:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In the class where you wish to repost a previous announcement, click on the <strong class="bold">Reuse post</strong> icon on the right-hand side of the <strong class="bold">Announce something to your class</strong> box:<div id="_idContainer128" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_3.21_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.21 – The Reuse Post icon&#13;&#10;" width="929" height="206"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.21 – The Reuse Post icon</p></li>
				<li>Click on <a id="_idIndexMarker146"/>the class that contains the previously created post:<div id="_idContainer129" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_3.22_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.22 – Selecting a class that will reuse a post&#13;&#10;" width="826" height="494"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.22 – Selecting a class that will reuse a post</p></li>
				<li>Select the desired post and click the <strong class="bold">REUSE</strong> button. Attachments are copied to the new post by default:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer130" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.23_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.23 – Selecting the post to reuse&#13;&#10;" width="1117" height="493"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.23 – Selecting the post to reuse</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Create Announcement</strong> dialog box will appear, with all the information filled in from the previous post. You can make changes before posting the announcement in the new class. (A <strong class="bold">Science</strong> class is shown reusing the <strong class="bold">Science</strong> post that was made previously.)</p>
			<p>When you create an announcement by following any of these methods, an email notification <a id="_idIndexMarker147"/>will be sent to co-teachers and students. While teaching at a high school, there are Google Classroom Classes for in-person classes I teach; other teacher classes who teach the same subjects; extra-curricular activities such as athletics or clubs; and a class with all staff for school-wide announcements. With so many classes, my email inbox can easily become flooded with notifications from Google Classroom.</p>
			<p>In the next section, we will explore how to manage the emails that Google Classroom sends.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor046"/>Managing announcement email notifications</h1>
			<p>By default, students <a id="_idIndexMarker148"/>will receive email notifications when you post an announcement (or any other type of post) to the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer131" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.24_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.24 – Email notifications of announcements&#13;&#10;" width="1120" height="322"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.24 – Email notifications of announcements</p>
			<p>These emails contain the title of and link to the post in Google Classroom. Another method where students receive notifications is through the Google Classroom app on their smart device.</p>
			<p>Teachers will receive even more email notifications. Examples of additional notifications include when students comment on announcements or other posts, send private messages about assignments, or when scheduled announcements are posted. Students and teachers may choose to customize the email notifications they want to receive.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"/>Disabling all email notifications</h2>
			<p>If you or <a id="_idIndexMarker149"/>your students do not wish to receive email notifications whenever a co-teacher or student posts in the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>, you can disable email notifications from within Google Classroom as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In Google Classroom, click on the burger menu button:<div id="_idContainer132" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_3.25_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.25 – Burger menu&#13;&#10;" width="597" height="246"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.25 – Burger menu</p></li>

			<p>Clicking <a id="_idIndexMarker151"/>on this link will take the user to a screen similar to the one shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.27</em>. Here, we can turn off the switch for receiving email notifications.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"/>Disabling email notifications for certain classes</h2>
			<p>There are many situations where a teacher may be enrolled in a class as a co-teacher or student. Examples include testing what students see in a Classroom, team teaching, and collaborating with another teacher or supervising teachers.</p>
			<p>In these instances, you may want to receive notifications for the classes you teach but want to disable notifications for other classes. Specifying which classes that you want to receive notifications about can be found in the same menu where you can disable all email notifications.</p>

			<p>In the same <strong class="bold">Notifications</strong> settings area where you can enable or disable email notifications, there are additional switches you can use to select what type of email notifications <a id="_idIndexMarker153"/>to receive. Options include whether to receive email notifications whenever someone publishes a comment on a post or invitations to join a class as a co-teacher or student. Be sure to explore these settings to determine which events in Google Classroom you want to receive email notifications for and which ones you do not.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">At the time of writing, customizing which events in Google Classroom will send email notifications to you will apply to all classes where notifications are enabled.</p>
			<p>As the teacher, managing notifications will help in reducing the number of emails that are sent to your inbox. Some schools use Google Classroom Classes to manage extra-curricular activities such as athletics and clubs, which results in teachers having many Classes per year.</p>
			<p>Without <a id="_idIndexMarker154"/>changing your notification settings, it becomes easy to receive dozens of emails per day, which will flood your inbox. Now that we've looked at one form of communicating with published posts, in the next section, we will explore another communication feature within a post's comments.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>Commenting on announcements</h1>
			<p>Once posts have been published to the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>, students and co-teachers will be able to comment <a id="_idIndexMarker155"/>on the announcements. These comments promote discussions and are similar to having students ask questions after you provide a verbal announcement during class time. Furthermore, in other types of posts, such as <strong class="bold">Questions</strong> and <strong class="bold">Assignments</strong>, students can use this commenting feature to reply to specific questions within the post. For students to comment on a post, they must follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In the classroom's <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>, click on the <strong class="bold">Add class comment…</strong> row at the bottom of the post:<div id="_idContainer138" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_3.31_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.31 – Adding a class comment field&#13;&#10;" width="868" height="220"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.31 – Adding a class comment field</p></li>
				<li>A field will appear for the student to enter text in. Direct the students to click on the <strong class="bold">Post</strong> icon when they have finished writing their comment:</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer139" class="IMG---Figure">

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.32 – The post icon</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Comments on a post are displayed for everyone in the class. Inappropriate use of the commenting feature in Google Classroom can detract from the learning environment. Later in this chapter, in the <em class="italic">Muting students</em> section, you will learn how to manage students who abuse the commenting system.</p>
			<p>As shown <a id="_idIndexMarker156"/>in the following screenshot, it does not take long for students to comment on a post in the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>. Students will often respond to other student comments and guide a discussion without needing too much additional input from the teacher:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.33 – The comment thread of an Announcement post</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">Using online discussions can be a great method for shy or quiet students to utilize an alternative environment where they may feel safer to communicate.</p>
			<p>When there <a id="_idIndexMarker157"/>are several comments, Google Classroom will collapse the comments in the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong> to save space. To expand all the comments of a post, click on the <strong class="bold">comments</strong> heading:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer141" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.34_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.34 – The comments heading&#13;&#10;" width="874" height="344"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.34 – The comments heading</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor051"/>Replying to comments</h2>
			<p>As more students and teachers comment on posts, more individuals can comment on specific posts. Replying to <a id="_idIndexMarker158"/>a specific comment on a post automatically adds that user as a mention. However, the comment appears at the bottom of the thread instead of directly below the comment that is being replied to:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.35 – A student mentioned in a comment</p>
			<p>To reply to a comment, click on the reply icon that appears when you hover your mouse over <a id="_idIndexMarker159"/>the comment. Then, continue writing your comment, as you usually would:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer143" class="IMG---Figure">

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.36 – Reply icon of a comment</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/>Managing comments</h2>
			<p>Since comments are published immediately, student comments may need to be managed <a id="_idIndexMarker160"/>and monitored. There are several tools that can help teachers control which students can comment.</p>
			<h3>Editing and deleting comments</h3>
			<p>Teachers <a id="_idIndexMarker161"/>and the comment's creator can edit and delete a comment. Deleted comments are immediately removed from the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>, but as <a id="_idIndexMarker162"/>a teacher, you will be able to view deleted comments and posts. To edit or delete a comment, click on the three vertical dots to display the actions you can perform:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer144" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.37_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.37 – Kebab menu of a comment&#13;&#10;" width="1060" height="216"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.37 – Kebab menu of a comment</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">You can only edit your own comments. Comments created by other teachers or students will only show <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> in the Kebab menu. If there are replies to a comment, they will remain as comments on the post.</p>
			<p>If you need to view deleted posts and comments in the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>, turn on the switch for <strong class="bold">Show deleted items</strong> in the Class settings.</p>
			<p>Click on <a id="_idIndexMarker163"/>the settings gear at the top of the Class:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer145" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.38_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.38 – Settings gear of the Class&#13;&#10;" width="629" height="75"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.38 – Settings gear of the Class</p>
			<p>In <a id="_idIndexMarker164"/>the <strong class="bold">General</strong> section, click the switch beside <strong class="bold">Show deleted items</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer146" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.39_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.39 – Show deleted items switch&#13;&#10;" width="777" height="101"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.39 – Show deleted items switch</p>
			<p>Sometimes, a student may post multiple comments that need to be deleted. Instead of constantly moderating the comments, specific students can have their commenting privileges revoked.</p>
			<h3>Muting students</h3>
			<p>If there is <a id="_idIndexMarker165"/>a student that is particularly inappropriate on the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>, you can disable that student's ability to reply to another classmate's work, post, or comment in the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>. To mute or unmute a student, click on the three vertical dots menu of the comment to display the mute action:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer147" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.40_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.40 – Muting a student from the comment menu&#13;&#10;" width="748" height="176"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.40 – Muting a student from the comment menu</p>
			<p>In the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong> and in the student list, a mute icon will be displayed beside the student's name so that you can easily see which students are muted:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer148" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.41_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.41 – Mute icon beside a student's name&#13;&#10;" width="1071" height="109"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.41 – Mute icon beside a student's name</p>
			<p>If a student <a id="_idIndexMarker166"/>is muted within a class, other classmates will not be able to see the mute icon beside their names. Only teachers and co-teachers will be able to see this icon.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Muting a student prevents the student from submitting work that is visible to other students, reply to classmates' work, or comment and post in the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>.</p>
			<p>Another method for muting students can be found in the <strong class="bold">People</strong> section. This method also allows you to mute or unmute multiple students at once. To use this method, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In Google Classroom, navigate to the <strong class="bold">People</strong> section using the tabs at the top of the Class:<div id="_idContainer149" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_3.42_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.42 – The People tab&#13;&#10;" width="609" height="116"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.42 – The People tab</p></li>
				<li>Check the checkboxes beside the students that you wish to mute (or unmute):<div id="_idContainer150" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_3.43_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.43 – Selecting students to mute&#13;&#10;" width="491" height="338"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.43 – Selecting students to mute</p></li>
				<li>Click <a id="_idIndexMarker167"/>on the <strong class="bold">Actions</strong> menu at the top of the student list and select <strong class="bold">Mute</strong> (or <strong class="bold">Unmute</strong>):</li>
			</ol>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer151" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.44_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.44 – Mute option in the Actions menu&#13;&#10;" width="368" height="344"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.44 – Mute option in the Actions menu</p>
			<h4>Viewing all muted students at a glance</h4>
			<p>You can <a id="_idIndexMarker168"/>see the mute icon beside all the student names in the class list. Therefore, finding muted students in this list is easier than finding muted students in the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer152" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_3.45_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.45 – Mute icons beside student names in the People section&#13;&#10;" width="548" height="365"/>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.45 – Mute icons beside student names in the People section</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Muting students may hinder class discussion on the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>. An alternative to using the comment feature is to post a question, which will be discussed in <a href="B16846_04_Final_SK_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor055"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Starting an Online Discussion with Questions</em>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor053"/>Disabling comments in the Stream</h2>
			<p>Despite all <a id="_idIndexMarker169"/>the comment managing <a id="_idIndexMarker170"/>features in Google Classroom, you may decide that your class is not ready for this feature or that you prefer your students to not comment in the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>. It is possible to completely disable the commenting feature by following these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">In Google Classroom, click on the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> gear at the top of the Class:<div id="_idContainer153" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_3.46_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.46 – Settings gear of the Class&#13;&#10;" width="610" height="89"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.46 – Settings gear of the Class</p></li>
				<li>In the <strong class="bold">General</strong> section, click on the <strong class="bold">Students can post and comment </strong>drop-down menu for the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong> setting to display a menu of different options for student access:<div id="_idContainer154" class="IMG---Figure"><img src="Images/Figure_3.47_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 3.47 – Stream post and comment settings menu&#13;&#10;" width="557" height="242"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.47 – Stream post and comment settings menu</p></li>
				<li>Select the desired permission level for posting and commenting in the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You can <a id="_idIndexMarker171"/>change the level of student <a id="_idIndexMarker172"/>access to the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong> at any time. As a means of classroom management, you can enable comments temporarily and then disable them (or vice versa), depending on your needs and the behavior of your students.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>This chapter provided you with a foundational knowledge of posting to a class <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>. While we only discussed the <strong class="bold">Announcement</strong> post, many of the features that can be found in the <strong class="bold">Announcement</strong> post, such as attaching files, links, and YouTube videos, are available for all the other post types. As you continue to use Google Classroom, the <strong class="bold">Stream</strong> will become a central location for you and your students to view most announcements, assignments, and discussions, which saves time in terms of organization and assessment.</p>
			<p>You are now able to create an <strong class="bold">Announcement</strong> post in Google Classroom, attach resources to the post, and reuse posts in other classes. In addition, you can comment on posts and manage student comments by deleting individual comments, muting students, or disabling the comment feature entirely.</p>
			<p>For situations where you wish to disable comments, or you prefer other means of interacting with your students, you can use the additional features of the <strong class="bold">Question</strong> post type. We will look at this in the next chapter.</p>
