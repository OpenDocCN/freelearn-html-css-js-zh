<h1 class="chapterTitle" id="_idParaDest-250">Using 3D Figures and Objects</h1>
<p class="normal">Clip Studio Paint is <a id="_idIndexMarker1069"/>one of the leading pieces of software for creating top-notch manga and illustrations. But did you know that it can also import and display 3D assets? Many 3D assets come ready in the Material palette and can be applied to use 3D assets as poses or background references. In this chapter, we’ll take a trip into the third dimension and learn about the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Introducing the 3D Material palette</li>
<li class="bulletList">Loading a 3D object onto the canvas</li>
<li class="bulletList">Moving an object in 3D space</li>
<li class="bulletList">Using preset poses on figure models</li>
<li class="bulletList">Customizing character and figure models</li>
<li class="bulletList">Saving 3D information to the Material palette</li>
<li class="bulletList">Importing 3D models into Clip Studio Paint</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">We are going to look at 3D materials closely and learn how to apply them to your canvas and then customize them as per your needs. Finally, we will learn how to save and import them. By using 3D materials to study poses or to use them as a reference when you ink, you can have a deeper understanding of how to depict 3D objects in a 2D drawing!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-251">Technical requirements</h1>
<p class="normal">To get started, you need Clip Studio Paint already installed on your device, and a new canvas opened with a white-colored paper layer. Any size is fine, but I recommend creating a 300 dpi square canvas to go through the content in this chapter.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-252">Introducing the 3D Material palette</h1>
<p class="normal">First of all, we<a id="_idIndexMarker1070"/> are going to look at the 3D assets in the Material palette. The Material palette is what we call the digital library of assets that are available through Clip Studio. Clip Studio comes with a huge library of brushes, images, screentones, 3D poses, objects, and more. More assets can be easily downloaded through Clip Studio Assets, which we will cover in <em class="italic">Chapter 18</em>, <em class="italic">Exploring Clip Studio Assets and Animations</em>. You can also save your own artwork to the Material palette, which is covered in <em class="italic">Chapter 9</em>, <em class="italic">Material Palette and Inking Special Effects.</em> For now, however, we will just concentrate on the 3D categories of the Material palette. In the 3D category, we have character heads, 3D figures, figures in poses, hands in poses, furniture, picture frames, accessories, and more! They are all great references or can be used to stencil to create our manga.</p>
<p class="normal">To access the Material palette, locate the appropriate palette location in your interface. If you cannot locate the Material palette, you can click on <strong class="screenText">Window</strong> in the <strong class="screenText">File</strong> menu and then navigate down to <strong class="screenText">Material</strong>. From the menu under the <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> option, click on <strong class="screenText">Material: 3D</strong> to open the 3D Material palette, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_14_14.1.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.1: Material drop-down menu</p>
<p class="normal">Now, we can <a id="_idIndexMarker1071"/>take a look at the <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> palette to see the contents of the 3D category. The <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> palette is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_14_14.2.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.2: 3D materials in the Material palette</p>
<p class="normal">On the <a id="_idIndexMarker1072"/>left-hand side of the Material palette is a list of the different categories of materials and their sub-categories. These categories organize our library of material assets and allow us to quickly find a specific material. The currently selected category will show up in the list with a blue highlight around its name. Any category name with an arrow symbol next to it means that that category can be expanded to show the sub-categories beneath it.</p>
<p class="normal">Sometimes, even sub-categories have more sub-categories, as can be seen next to the <strong class="screenText">Pose</strong> sub-category in <em class="italic">Figure 14.2</em>.</p>
<p class="normal">The right-hand side of the Material window shows a list of the materials with images in the library. The currently selected material will have a blue highlight around it. Details about the current selection are shown in the bottom section of the Material palette.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">If a material in the list has a cloud icon with a down-facing arrow in the top corner of the preview image, this means that the material must be downloaded from Clip Studio Assets before it becomes available for use. These assets are usually available at no cost to you, but they will increase the storage space Clip Studio needs on your hard drive!</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Great, you found a variety of 3D assets in the <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> palette! Let’s move on to learn how to paste them onto your canvas.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-253">Loading a 3D object onto the canvas</h1>
<p class="normal">Now you<a id="_idIndexMarker1073"/> know <a id="_idIndexMarker1074"/>there are many 3D assets available in Clip Studio Paint, but you need to import them onto your canvas to work on! In this section, we will learn how to import those 3D assets from the Material palette to your canvas, so that you can start to move or manipulate them.</p>
<p class="normal">Follow these easy <a id="_idIndexMarker1075"/>steps to add a 3D asset to a canvas:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Open a <a id="_idIndexMarker1076"/>new canvas, if one is not already open. Material assets can only be added to a currently opened document.</li>
<li class="numberedList">In the 3D Material palette, click on the 3D asset to be added to the canvas. In this example, we are using the <strong class="screenText">3D drawing figure-Ver.2 (Male)</strong> asset.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Once the material is selected, click on the <strong class="screenText">Paste selected material to canvas</strong> icon at the bottom of the Material palette, which looks like the screenshot on the right:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_14_14.3.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.3: Paste selected material to canvas icon</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="4">The asset will be pasted to the canvas. Note that, depending on your computer’s specifications and the 3D asset, this may take a few minutes to complete.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">The 3D figure we chose in the preceding steps is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_14_14.4.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.4: Pasted 3D material</p>
<p class="normal">As you can see, this<a id="_idIndexMarker1077"/> is a decent 3D drawing doll<a id="_idIndexMarker1078"/> that makes for a pretty good reference! But this pose is a little too static, and we need to move the limbs around to get some personality and life into this reference pose. Let’s move this 3D figure and the camera around.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-254">Moving objects in 3D space</h1>
<p class="normal">Now that we’ve <a id="_idIndexMarker1079"/>learned how to add a 3D object to our canvas, we can move and pose that object on our canvas. It requires time, practice, and patience to learn how to pose 3D characters in Clip Studio Paint, but once you know the basics of 3D space, you’ll become an expert in no time!</p>
<p class="normal">The screenshots from <em class="italic">Figure 14.5</em> to <em class="italic">Figure 14.25</em> in the <em class="italic">Moving an object on the x, y, and z axes</em>, <em class="italic">Moving parts of a model</em>, <em class="italic">Moving the 3D camera</em>, <em class="italic">Using preset poses on figure models</em>, and<em class="italic"> Customizing characters</em> sections show the <strong class="screenText">School girl B-Ver. 3 </strong>3D character model. This model is available as a free download through the 3D character <a id="_idIndexMarker1080"/>materials and Clip Studio Assets. For more information on how to download assets with Clip Studio Assets, see <em class="italic">Chapter 18</em>, <em class="italic">Exploring the Clip Studio Assets and Animation</em>.</p>
<p class="normal">The 3D object is now standing there, at its default angle. Let’s learn how to move it around to fit your desired position in the next section!</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-255">Moving an object on the x, y, and z axes</h2>
<p class="normal">To get <a id="_idIndexMarker1081"/>your 3D asset into the correct position on the canvas for your scene, you may need to move or rotate it on the <em class="italic">x</em>, <em class="italic">y</em>, or <em class="italic">z</em> axis. This is true for 3D figures, objects, or any of the 3D backgrounds that can be used in Clip Studio Paint. Follow these instructions to learn how to move objects through 3D space:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Be sure that the <strong class="screenText">Operation</strong> | <strong class="screenText">Object</strong> tool is selected before continuing.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on the 3D object that you wish to manipulate if it is not already selected. A box will appear around the edge of the 3D object, and a command bar of icons will also appear both above and below the object. We will be using the top set of icons to move the object around in the space.</li>
<li class="numberedList">To move the entire object up, down, left, or right, hover the mouse cursor over the fourth icon at the top left of the box around the selected object. Click on the canvas, hold the left mouse button or stylus, and drag it to move the object in the desired direction. The screenshot on the right shows the location of the icon being used to move the object up, down, left, or right. It is highlighted in dark blue:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_14_14.5.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.5: Pasted 3D material and icons</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="4">To rotate <a id="_idIndexMarker1082"/>the object along the <em class="italic">x</em> axis (horizontal axis), and the <em class="italic">y</em> axis (vertical axis), hover the mouse cursor over the fifth icon from the left at the top of the box around the selected object.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click and hold the left mouse button or stylus and drag. The object will rotate straight along the <em class="italic">x</em> or <em class="italic">y</em> axis, or diagonally to both axes, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_14_14.6.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.6: Rotated 3D material</p>
<p class="normal-one">To tilt the <a id="_idIndexMarker1083"/>object clockwise and anti-clockwise, click the sixth icon from the left, click on the object, and drag it to the right or left, as shown in the following screenshot. Notice her hair dragged along with the motion and gravity in <em class="italic">Figure 14.7</em>.</p>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.7: Tilted 3D material</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="6">To simply turn the object around, click the seventh icon from the left and click on the object, then drag it to the right or left, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_14_14.8.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.8: Turned 3D material</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="7">To <a id="_idIndexMarker1084"/>move the object back and forth in a 3D space, click the third icon from the left at the top of the box around the selected object. Click and hold the left mouse button or stylus and drag up or down. The icon is shown in <em class="italic">Figure 14.9</em>, highlighted in dark blue, and the character has been moved back, away from the camera.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_14_14.9.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.9: Backed-away 3D material</p>
<p class="normal">There is also <a id="_idIndexMarker1085"/>an easy way to move the object around, which is using a manipulator sphere. It’s always best when there is an alternative way to move an object because you can pick whichever you feel works best for you. Read on to learn what a manipulator sphere is and how it works!</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-256">Moving an object using a manipulator sphere</h2>
<p class="normal">A manipulator sphere<a id="_idIndexMarker1086"/> is a group of circles that have three axes (<em class="italic">x</em>, <em class="italic">y</em>, and <em class="italic">z</em>), and with camera<a id="_idIndexMarker1087"/> zoom directions, you can freely switch between these axes. You can apply all <a id="_idIndexMarker1088"/>the editing we have done so far in the preceding sections by using a manipulator sphere, and you might find it easier. If you click on the object, the sphere appears as in the following screenshot:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_14_14.10.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.10: 3D editing sphere</p>
<p class="normal">Once the<a id="_idIndexMarker1089"/> manipulator sphere is visible, you <a id="_idIndexMarker1090"/>can use it to adjust the object in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Make sure to uncheck any icon at the top of the box. Click and hold anywhere on the canvas and drag your mouse or stylus along freely in whichever direction you want the object to turn.</li>
<li class="numberedList">If you <a id="_idIndexMarker1091"/>want the object closer or farther away from the camera, click and hold the outermost spikey circle<a id="_idIndexMarker1092"/> and drag along the inner (farther) or outer (closer) direction. All axes except the corresponding axis to the direction of movement will turn themselves off, as seen in the following screenshots – from left, vertical rotation, tilt, horizontal rotation, and camera distance:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_14_14.11.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.11: Four directions of 3D editing</p>
<p class="normal">You can have fun watching the 3D character’s hair and skirt being animated to show movement while dragging it around.</p>
<p class="normal">But isn’t the character too static and lifeless? You can learn how to change her pose by reading on to the next section.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-257">Moving parts of a model</h2>
<p class="normal">Some <a id="_idIndexMarker1093"/>models, such as figures and characters, as well as certain object models, can have individual parts of them moved. In this section, we will continue with the <strong class="screenText">School Girl B</strong> model and move her arm, as an example of how to pose a character:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">With <a id="_idIndexMarker1094"/>the <strong class="screenText">Object</strong> sub-tool, click on the model you’d like to pose. Once the model is selected, the movement controls will show. In the screenshot on the right, the blue circles are the movement handles for the major joints of the body.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_14_14.12.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.12: Movement handles</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="2">Click on the movement control handle of the body part you want to move. While holding down the mouse button or stylus, drag the control handle to move that part of the model.</li>
<li class="numberedList">When a control handle is selected, a sphere made of red, green, and blue lines will also be visible. This control allows you finer access to the movement of a part of the model in the <em class="italic">x</em>, <em class="italic">y</em>, and <em class="italic">z</em> axes. Simply click and hold down the mouse button or stylus on the line of the sphere corresponding to the axis you wish to move the part of the model in and drag to complete the movement.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">Using the <a id="_idIndexMarker1095"/>motion control handles, a character can be posed quickly! The screenshot on the right was created in just a few moments by clicking and dragging the handles. The slight rotation of the right foot was achieved using the axis control lines.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_14_14.13.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.13: Edited 3D object</p>
<p class="normal">With the new pose, the character looks lively and appears more natural!</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">You can attach one or more 3D objects to a main figure and move them along together. Paste one more 3D object on the same canvas, and in the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette, click on the wrench-shaped icon in the lower-right corner to open the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool Detail</strong> palette. Locate the object name you have just downloaded in the object list, then click and drag it to the other main object to make a hierarchy with sub-objects, as you can see in the screenshot on the right. Now you can move them together!</p>
<p class="normal">If you need to separate them later, simply click and drag the sub-object’s name out of the hierarchy.</p>
<div><figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_14_14.14.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.14: Object list category on the Sub Tool Detail palette</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="normal">You can also edit the hand gesture. Read on to find out how.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-258">Posing hands</h2>
<p class="normal">Hands can be <a id="_idIndexMarker1096"/>posed on a character either by clicking on each finger joint or by using the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool Detail</strong> menu to adjust the fingers. Let’s take a quick look at the hand control in the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool Detail</strong> menu because it’s a much faster way to pose hands than doing it by individual finger joints!</p>
<p class="normal">Follow these steps to change the hand pose:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Click on one of the hands of the character you wish to pose.</li>
<li class="numberedList">In the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette, click on the wrench-shaped icon in the lower-right corner to open the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool Detail</strong> palette.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Choose <strong class="screenText">Hand pose</strong> in the <strong class="screenText">Character</strong> category from the menu on the left-hand side of the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool Detail</strong> palette. The screen on the right will appear.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_14_14.15.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.15: Hand pose settings on the Sub Tool Detail palette</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="4">By moving <a id="_idIndexMarker1097"/>the crosshair icon inside of the triangle shape overlayed on the hand icon, the fingers of the model can be made to spread far apart or come in close together, and also to open or close into a fist.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Above the large icon of the hand in the screenshot in <em class="italic">Figure 14.15</em>, there are five icons that look like links in a chain. Clicking on one of these will lock the corresponding finger into the current position while allowing the other fingers to continue to be posed.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">The best way<a id="_idIndexMarker1098"/> to really understand these hand controls is to play around with them yourself and get a feel for them! So, give them a try and see whether you like them.</p>
<p class="normal">You can also take a picture of your hand and apply the hand pose to the 3D object. Follow these steps to use the Hand Scanner:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Click the icon of a camera on a hand in the <strong class="screenText">Hand pose</strong> category in the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool Detail</strong> palette to open the <strong class="screenText">Hand Scanner</strong> window.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Once the window opens, you will see the camera function is activated, and the 3D hand is posing in real time corresponding to your hand poses in the camera. You can see a sample in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_14_14.16.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.16: Hand Scanner window and the 3D figure</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="3">You can select <strong class="screenText">Back Camera</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Back Camera (Mirror),</strong> <strong class="screenText">Front Camera</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Front Camera (Mirror)</strong> to take the hand photo. Also, there is an option for which side of the hand of the 3D figure to apply the hand pose to. When you strike the ideal pose, click <strong class="screenText">Pause capture</strong> to see how it applies to the figure.</li>
<li class="numberedList">You<a id="_idIndexMarker1099"/> can repeat step 3 till you decide the ideal pose. When you make up your mind, click <strong class="screenText">OK</strong> to finish posing the hand.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">Wow, how easy and quick to create your ideal hand pose!</p>
<p class="normal">Not only can you move 3D objects in Clip Studio Paint but you can also move the 3D camera as well. Let’s explore how to do this in the next section.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-259">Moving the 3D camera</h2>
<p class="normal">The 3D camera is<a id="_idIndexMarker1100"/> another way of saying from what angle we are looking at the 3D object or scene. Instead of moving the 3D character or object, we can move the position from where we are looking at the model.</p>
<p class="normal">When moving <a id="_idIndexMarker1101"/>the camera around the object, the object model will remain stationary. Follow these instructions to move the 3D camera:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">To move the camera up, down, left, or right, click the second icon from the left at the top of the box around the selected object. Click and hold the left mouse button or stylus and drag. The selected icon is shown in dark blue in the screenshot on the right:<p class="packt_figref"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_14_14.17.png"/></p>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.17: 3D camera icon</p>
</li>
<li class="numberedList">To rotate the camera around the object, click the first icon from the left at the top of the box around the selected object. Click and hold the left mouse button or stylus and drag. The icon and the camera rotation are shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_14_14.18.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.18: 3D camera icon 2</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="3">To <a id="_idIndexMarker1102"/>move the camera back and forth in the 3D space, click the third icon from the left at the top of the box around the selected object. </li>
</ol>
<p class="numberedList">Click and hold the left mouse button or stylus and drag up or down. The following screenshot shows that the icon has been selected. Note that if you get the camera very close to the 3D character, the character will be displayed so big that it will eventually leave the canvas:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_14_14.19.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.19: 3D camera icon 3</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-260">Adding perspective</h2>
<p class="normal">We can <a id="_idIndexMarker1103"/>add extreme perspective to our 3D figure! Sometimes, we need to emphasize perspective to create dramatic scenes, such as a character punching toward a camera.</p>
<p class="normal">We can achieve this by changing the <strong class="screenText">Perspective</strong> value of the camera. Let’s try out the following steps to learn how:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">With the <strong class="screenText">Object</strong> sub-tool, click on the model, then create a pose that has the model’s hand in front of its face.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Go to the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool Detail</strong> palette and increase the value of <strong class="screenText">Perspective</strong> in the <strong class="screenText">Camera</strong> category. You should get a result similar to the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a cartoon  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_14_14.20.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.20: Perspective setting on the figure</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="3">Adjust<a id="_idIndexMarker1104"/> the value to get the required amount of perspective. You can now apply it to your great punching scene, as in the screenshot on the right:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A cartoon of a person with her fist up  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_14_14.21.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 14.21: Sample art referring to perspective figure</p>
<p class="normal">As well as<a id="_idIndexMarker1105"/> a punching pose, we can also use this method to create a scene looking up at a physically huge character from the floor level. Have fun controlling the perspective of your 3D model.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Rotate the camera when posing your character to check the position of the limbs for accuracy. See the <em class="italic">Moving parts of a model</em> section of this chapter for instructions on posing characters.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">You can edit poses and camera angles using icons, the manipulator sphere, and the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool Detail</strong> palette. But isn’t it handy to use the preset poses, skipping all the hassle? Let’s see how to find and use them!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-261">Using preset poses on figure models</h1>
<p class="normal">There are many<a id="_idIndexMarker1106"/> preset poses available for use in your creation. We will look into how to find and apply them to a 3D figure or character next.</p>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText"><a id="_idIndexMarker1107"/></strong><strong class="screenText">3D</strong> section of the Material palette includes <a id="_idIndexMarker1108"/>many sub-categories. One of these categories is an entire library of premade poses that you can drag and drop onto a character model or one of the generic male or female figure models. Using these poses is a great way to get your character or figure reference into a pose quickly. You may need to make a tweak or two to get the pose absolutely perfect. But many of these poses work well on their own or are a fantastic starting point for creating your own poses. As a bonus, they’re easy to use, too!</p>
<p class="normal">Follow these steps to find out how:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">In the <strong class="screenText">3D</strong> category of the <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> palette, find the <strong class="screenText">Pose</strong> category and expand it by clicking on the arrow to the left of the category. Then, click on the <strong class="screenText">Entire Body</strong> sub-category.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Select a pose to add to the character. In this example, we are using a pose called <strong class="screenText">Rest chin in hand 01</strong>.</li>

<p class="normal">Did you know you can import poses from images, photos, and the Posemaniacs website? The Pose Scanner reads an image containing a figure and applies the pose to 3D figures<a id="_idIndexMarker1111"/> or 3D characters. It can read various image formats, including BMP, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, and Targa. If you are using a tablet, you<a id="_idIndexMarker1112"/> can take a photo with <a id="_idIndexMarker1113"/>the camera and apply it to your 3D figures.</p>

<p class="normal">Importing <a id="_idIndexMarker1123"/>poses from images, the camera, and Posemaniacs is<a id="_idIndexMarker1124"/> a brilliant time-saver, especially <a id="_idIndexMarker1125"/>when you need to have conventional poses such as aiming an arrow, a horse-riding posture, and sword-fighting kata.</p>
<p class="normal">Isn’t it both easy and handy to use a preset pose and import the most suitable ones? You can also edit them after applying them to your canvas. Read on to learn how.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-262">Customizing character and figure models</h1>
<p class="normal">Clip Studio Paint <a id="_idIndexMarker1126"/>allows for the customization of both the<a id="_idIndexMarker1127"/> character models and generic figure models that come with its 3D library. The character models can have their expressions, hairstyles, clothes, and accessories changed, while the generic figures can have their proportions altered. Let’s find out how to alter the 3D model proportions, change and alter a head model.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-263">Customizing figure models</h2>
<p class="normal">The generic <a id="_idIndexMarker1128"/>male and female drawing models don’t have accessories and clothes to change. However, their head and body types can be altered to more accurately reflect the character you’re drawing.</p>
<p class="normal">In this section, we will discover how to adjust the proportions of the body and head drawing figure. Follow these steps to learn how:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Follow the instructions in the previous <em class="italic">Introducing the 3D Material palette</em> section to load the male drawing figure model onto the canvas.</li>
<li class="numberedList">In the command bar, under the selected 3D figure, click on the icon on the far right, labeled <strong class="screenText">Adjust body shape and size of 3D drawing figure in detail</strong>.

<p class="normal">You have now grasped <a id="_idIndexMarker1134"/>how to customize both the body and the head of your 3D drawing figure!</p>
<p class="normal">In the next section, we are going to save our customized model to our Material palette so that we can use it again later.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-264">Saving 3D information to the Material palette</h1>
<p class="normal">You put in a lot of <a id="_idIndexMarker1135"/>effort to adjust the body shape, size, and head of the figure model, and it would be such a shame if you lost the data, especially if you’d like to use it for a character that appears in your manga several times. Therefore, it’s always good to know how to save it. Let’s find out how to do that in this section.</p>
<p class="normal">Two types of 3D information can be saved to the 3D Material palette: pose information and 3D drawing figures. Pose information can be saved both from the generic male and female figures as well as from the character models. 3D drawing figure (proportion and facial features) information can only be saved from the generic male and female drawing figures. Currently, there is no way to save changes to the character figures as custom materials.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-265">Saving pose information</h2>
<p class="normal">When <a id="_idIndexMarker1136"/>you customize the poses of a character or an object, it’s always a good idea to save them in case you want to use the same pose again in the future, so you don’t need to repeat the same customization process over and over.</p>
<p class="normal">Follow these steps to save a character’s pose information to the Material palette:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Click on the character or drawing figure whose pose you’d like to save.</li>
<li class="numberedList">In the command bar below the figure, locate the <strong class="screenText">Register pose to Material palette</strong> icon, which looks like the screenshot on the right.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="3">Click <a id="_idIndexMarker1137"/>on the icon to bring up the <strong class="screenText">Material property</strong> window. You can also bring up Material property by clicking the up and down triangles next to the human-shaped icon (see <em class="italic">Figure 14.33</em>), then click the option you want from the drop-down menu: <strong class="screenText">Register full body pose as material</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Register left hand pose as material</strong>, or <strong class="screenText">Register right hand pose as material</strong>.

</ol>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">I always recommend tagging every material that you save to the Material palette. It’s an extra step, but it could save you a lot of time in the long run! In addition to tagging them with terms that describe the material itself, I always use a custom tag for anything that I save to the Material palette so that I can enter that search term and find everything I’ve saved.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Now you <a id="_idIndexMarker1139"/>can use this pose information on any figure or character! For instructions on using preset poses, see the <em class="italic">Using preset poses on figure models</em> section of this chapter.</p>

<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-267">Importing 3D models into Clip Studio Paint</h1>
<p class="normal">Using <a id="_idIndexMarker1142"/>the 3D assets in the Material palette is all well and good, but what about importing a unique model from another program? In this section, we are going to look at how to do so, and how to turn it into a line drawing as a finishing touch. But there is a downside to using this function too much, as the characters might look too artificial and generic – it’s good to remember to not abuse this tool too much and keep this as a basic template for creating your unique art style.</p>
<p class="normal">Although <a id="_idIndexMarker1143"/>Clip Studio Paint can import 3D information from other programs, there are some limitations. For instance, sometimes, color and texture information for a model from an outside source may not be imported into Clip Studio Paint correctly.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Important note</strong></p>
<p class="normal">The file types that can be imported into Clip Studio Paint are the Clip Studio 3D Character format (extension <strong class="screenText">cs3c</strong>), Clip Studio 3D Object format (extension <strong class="screenText">cs3o</strong>), Clip Studio 3D Background format (extension <strong class="screenText">cs3s</strong>), and <strong class="screenText">fbx</strong>, <strong class="screenText">6kt</strong>, <strong class="screenText">6kh</strong>, <strong class="screenText">lwo</strong>, <strong class="screenText">lws</strong>, <strong class="screenText">obj</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">VRM</strong> files.</p>

<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-268">Summary</h1>
<p class="normal">This chapter took us deep into the third dimension and got us familiar with the 3D assets available in the Material palette. We learned how to add 3D assets to our canvas, as well as how to move them in the 3D space. We learned how to rotate and move our camera to give us a different perspective on 3D models. We also learned how to use saved poses from the Material palette, from picture or photo references, from the Posemaniacs website, and from the camera, as well as how to customize the character models that come with it. Then, we learned how to save our own 3D information as materials that we can use later. Finally, we learned how to import models from other 3D applications and how to turn those models into line drawings using the <strong class="screenText">Convert to lines and tones</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Convert layer</strong> options.</p>
<p class="normal">These skills will help you draw characters and objects with consistency every time they appear on your manga pages. They’ll also expand your range of visual expressions, camera positions, and character poses.</p>
<p class="normal">Now, we’re going to start getting into coloring your comic! In the next chapter, we will begin by talking about the different ways to make color palettes in Clip Studio Paint, and how to use the eyedropper and <strong class="screenText">Sub View</strong> palette to select colors.</p>
