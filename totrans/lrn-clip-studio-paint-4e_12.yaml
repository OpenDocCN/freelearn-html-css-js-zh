    the piece that you shouldn’t touch, so that you can go crazy with your brush.
    There is a similar function in digital drawing, too! The layer mask is an extremely
    useful feature in digital art that has many applications. Thanks to the function,
    we can concentrate on drawing without caring too much about pen strokes going

- en: A layer mask is a feature of digital art that allows parts of a layer to be
    hidden without being erased for good. This allows us to fine-tune a drawing or
    part of a drawing without losing what has already been done. Layer masks can be
    adjusted over and over, hiding parts of a drawing and then being removed again
    to bring those parts back.

    changes to be made without losing any data. We can see what a character looks

    paper. This meant that older printed illustrations didn’t have gray tones. Artists
    had to draw detailed dots and line patterns using black ink in order to express
    gray tones for printing. But it’s time consuming to do that! To make the process
    faster, people invented screentones.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Screentones, or halftones, are made of a pattern of dots that provide shading.
    Back in the days before digital art, these tones would be printed on a big sheet
    of sticky-backed plastic. Artists would apply this large, clear sticker over their
    art and then carefully use a sharp knife to cut out the areas that didn’t need
    tone on them and peel away the excess. The downsides to this method were that
    you had to keep buying new screentone sheets and that, sometimes, a careless stroke
    would cut through your original artwork and ruin it!
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But now, we can mimic these patterns of dots digitally. And, thanks to layer
    masks, we can simply mask out the areas that don’t need to be shaded without doing
    any damage to the screentone pattern or our original sketch. This makes the screentone
    process easier and less stressful than it used to be!

    area where you want to add a screentone.

    a dark gray color but looks lighter now. That doesn’t give the right shade for
    this character. You can fix this by clicking on the **Density** option on the
    **Layer Property** palette and selecting **Use brightness of image** from the
    **Density** drop-down menu, as shown in *Figure 12.25*.

    Your Manga.*

- en: When you use screentones incorrectly, your art can look bad, with the screentone
    shading for a character breaching the character’s outline and intruding on the
    background. How can we fix this easily? Wouldn’t it take too much time to adjust
    the screentones using eraser and pen tools here and there so that we don’t go
    over the boundaries when we want screentones to stay inside the character’s outline?

    boundary and no further. It is called the clipping layer function. It makes your
    shading very accurate! We’ll look into this in the next section.

    when you are shading. A clipping layer is a layer that clips to the layer below
    it, only showing the contents of the top layer in places where the bottom layer
    has pixels filled in. It comes in handy when you want to add shading only inside
    a colored area.

    light gray color from the **Color** palette and then use the **Fill** tool to
    fill with color any area that is enclosed by outlines.

    tool with any dark color to paint an area where you want to add a screentone.
    Do not worry, as the color won’t stay in the gray area; just add variations of
    thin and thick colors, something like *Figure 12.26*.

    you can use it with patterns, colors, shades, and screentones. Also, of course,

    it, and modify content anytime you want!

    learned how to make a layer mask using selection tools to save time. We then learned
    about the benefits of using layer masks in comparison with eraser tools. We also
    used screentone materials and created simple tones by using selections and layer
    masks.
