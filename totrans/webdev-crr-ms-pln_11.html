<h1 id="_idParaDest-280"><a id="_idTextAnchor280"/>Reviewing Soft Skills (They Make You Hard to Deny)</h1>
<p>We’ve spent a lot of time talking about the technical side of web development, how to get a job in the field, and some developmental topics to help you grow your career. But there’s another set of things that you need to be aware of to enjoy a fruitful career. These are things we call soft skills.</p>
<p>What are soft skills? These are things such as your attitude, how to communicate with others effectively, socializing appropriately with co-workers, continuing the growth of your technical knowledge, and software development methodologies. These are things that aren’t technical in nature and that you typically don’t learn in books or classrooms. You tend to learn them from the examples of others, and sometimes by trial and error. My goal is, hopefully, to remove as much of the error from that equation as possible!</p>
<p>Soft skills will not only help you get hired and be a good employee, but they also are vital to advancing your career. Even the best technicians will tend to plateau at some point in their career development if they lack soft skills. These skills become more important as you climb the ladder, but they’re always valuable, right from rung one!</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s no “I” in “team”</li>
<li>Learning never stops</li>
<li>Moving beyond smoke signals with good communication skills</li>
<li>Exploring the Agile software development methodology</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-281"><a id="_idTextAnchor281"/>There’s no “I” in “Team”</h1>
<p>I can boil this entire section down to just seven words:</p>
<p><em class="italic">Be someone people want to </em><em class="italic">work with.</em></p>
<p>That sounds simple, and guess what? It actually <em class="italic">is</em> simple! Of course, simple doesn’t necessarily mean easy. But let’s talk about the simple part first.</p>
<p>Being someone <a id="_idIndexMarker1025"/>people want to work with means many things, but primarily it means being someone friendly and helpful, someone who can be relied on to get the job done and do so with a pleasant demeanor. However, this doesn’t automatically mean you have to be an outgoing, gregarious person. No; you can be quiet and reserved but still be seen as someone friendly to interact with.</p>
<p>During the interview process, it’s important to keep this in mind because, at that point, you’re trying to sell yourself. One of the things you will be judged on is whether you seem like someone who knows how to work well with others. This is the cultural fit aspect of the interview. We almost always have to work with others, so it makes sense that we would want to enjoy doing so, or at the very least not mind doing so. Therefore, you must make a good impression during an interview.</p>
<p>In particular, make sure you smile most of the time, look people in the eye when you speak to them, pay them the attention they deserve given that they are effectively there to judge you, and generally stay in the moment with them. You want to be attentive and not distracted, and you should answer questions with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Of course, this all applies after you’ve gotten the job too! You have to remember that, as the saying goes, <em class="italic">there is no “I” in “team”</em>, and part of that means ensuring you are making others comfortable around you. Never bring your work home because that can impact your home life, and by the same token, don’t bring your personal problems to work. People don’t usually appreciate someone who dumps all their problems on them in the office.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to be seen as a team player is to be someone who can help others whenever and however you can. Let’s touch on that a bit.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-282"><a id="_idTextAnchor282"/>Helping where you can</h2>
<p>Being a team <a id="_idIndexMarker1026"/>player, of course, is more than just being a friendly face. Always be the person that people can come to for help and who is willing to give their time to assist. It’s sometimes hard to remember that if you help someone get their work done, then you’ve still performed a service to your employer. Of course, there is a balance that needs to be struck because we all have our own tasks to accomplish, so you must be careful not to give <em class="italic">too</em> much of yourself.</p>
<p>At first, it’s natural that you may not have much to offer others who have more experience. But you’d be surprised how just being friendly and approachable can result in people coming to you for help. And it makes sense: if you know that the curmudgeonly guy in the corner probably has the answer, you might still prefer to take a little more time working through a problem with someone more junior because that guy is just not pleasant to interact with.</p>
<p>But also remember that just because you may not know as much doesn’t automatically mean you can’t help. Sometimes, it’s just that second set of eyes changing your perspective a little bit that is what you need to solve a problem. And even then, remember our discussion of rubber duck debugging and Stack Overflow in <a href="B18315_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor259"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>? Sometimes just being there to listen to someone explain a problem is all they need to figure it out on their own, so you will have done them a service just by being a good listener!</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not <a id="_idIndexMarker1027"/>always about just listening; sometimes you have to give feedback. How you do that is part of being a good teammate too.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-283"><a id="_idTextAnchor283"/>Being kind when being critical</h2>
<p>Eventually, in your<a id="_idIndexMarker1028"/> career, you’re not going to have any choice but to be critical of someone. More precisely, you’ll need to be critical of their work. When this time comes, you will most likely have had others who have been critical of your work, and if you have, keep how you felt in mind. Was that person able to deliver the criticism constructively and kindly? Hopefully yes because that’s the goal.</p>
<p>There is, unfortunately, a common attitude amongst many technical people that says being blunt is preferred and if someone takes offense they need to just toughen up. I, for one, very much disagree with this. Being <em class="italic">honest</em> is, of course, supremely important. But being honest doesn’t mean being harsh, or at least it shouldn’t.</p>
<p>Take care with the words you choose. Rather than saying “This class structure doesn’t make sense”, you might say something like “Ah, I see what you’re doing here, and why you chose to do things this way, but I wonder, have you considered doing X instead?” That expresses your concern with their work while not being as hard-edged. Of course, it should be obvious that you should never say something such as “This class structure is stupid”, but most people get that much right. It’s the more subtly harsh language that is trickier to pick out and avoid, but staying in the moment and concentrating on what you’re saying and how is the way to accomplish that.</p>
<p>You may sometimes get it wrong. If that happens, don’t hesitate to apologize, whether immediately or<a id="_idIndexMarker1029"/> later if it takes you some time to realize your mistake, which is something else to discuss.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-284"><a id="_idTextAnchor284"/>Taking responsibility</h2>
<p>Almost nothing<a id="_idIndexMarker1030"/> frustrates me more than when I see a member of my team not taking responsibility for their actions, especially their mistakes. That’s just not professional in my eyes and might even be considered a sign of immaturity. No one enjoys admitting they made a mistake, but that’s what responsible, adult professionals do.</p>
<p>When you do inevitably make mistakes—and believe me, we <em class="italic">all</em> make them—you should own them. Stand up, say “Yes, I made this mistake”, and then formulate a plan to correct the mistake. This plays into the need for people to rely on you. Relying on people who make mistakes and own them is easy, but relying on people who shirk responsibility is impossible.</p>
<p>Here, too, is another place where there is a fine line you must walk. There are obviously times when you get things wrong due to circumstances you couldn’t anticipate or even the actions of others, and expressing those things is a valid thing to do, but it can be seen as trying to side-step responsibility. The best advice I can give here is that it’s okay to say “Yes, I got X wrong, but it’s because of factors Y and Z” as long as you follow that with “but it doesn’t matter because here’s what I’m going to do to correct the situation”. That tells people that yes, maybe you didn’t perform perfectly, but there were external factors. And regardless, <em class="italic">you</em> are going to take the responsibility for fixing the situation. That demonstrates that you don’t put yourself above the team and can be counted on.</p>
<p>Another thing that makes people enjoy working with you is not waiting around for things to happen but instead making them happen yourself by being proactive.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-285"><a id="_idTextAnchor285"/>Being proactive</h2>
<p>My wife, a<a id="_idIndexMarker1031"/> professional chef, has a saying: “If you have time to stand around, then you have time to clean.” That works well in a kitchen, where keeping a clean environment is a big concern (a health concern for all, in fact!), but with a little tweaking, it works just as well in a web development context!</p>
<p>Basically, what it means in that context is that you can either be the type of person who sits around waiting for someone to tell you what to do and what to build or you can be proactive and look for opportunities yourself and dive in.</p>
<p>Maybe you can spend some time cleaning up your CI/CD configuration files. Or perhaps you could write up some documentation about the configuration parameters that an application you support has. Or you might look at some code that isn’t written very well and <strong class="bold">refactor</strong> it, where<a id="_idIndexMarker1032"/> refactor means to rewrite it so it’s better (cleaner, simpler, more robust) without changing its functionality. You might look at optimizing the images used on your website to improve loading speed or you might implement an administrative function to be able to record errors that occur better.</p>
<p>The point isn’t specifically what you do, it’s simply the idea that you should look around, see what needs to get done, and then do it, or at the least, <em class="italic">offer</em> to do it. It may not always be the best idea to just go off and do a bunch of work on your own, but you can certainly raise your hand and say “Hey, it looks like we should do X and I have some free time right now, so can I go do it?”. Get buy-in from your senior people to be safe, but you’ll find most people are very receptive to such requests (or else they’ll redirect you to higher-priority work, which is just as good).</p>
<p>Most people appreciate people who don’t simply wait for things to happen and to be told what to do because it removes load from them, both in terms of getting things done and also in terms of them having to figure out what you should work on. To be sure, you <em class="italic">will</em> have idle time sometimes, and obviously, in most situations, you’ll have someone directing your work. But, as the saying goes, idle hands are the devil’s playground. So, always be looking for ways to fend off that horned critter and make yourself useful and productive to the team when time allows. It’s a sure way to engender positive feelings toward you.</p>
<p>Of course, hardly any of this matters without one last consideration: honesty.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-286"><a id="_idTextAnchor286"/>Being honest, always</h2>
<p>Earlier, I mentioned<a id="_idIndexMarker1033"/> criticism and how some people are very blunt and direct when giving it. I spoke about how this can be detrimental to team cohesiveness because it can rub people the wrong way. But at the core of the harshness is a good principle: honesty. While it’s true that being overly blunt can land you in a situation where you start being unkind, honesty is a quality that should in general be valued at all times.</p>
<p>Of course, you should never under any circumstances outright lie; that much I would hope is obvious! You may think you’re protecting yourself with a lie, but all you’re really doing is ensuring that you’ll never be trusted if found out. You’re also not giving your teammates the information they need to address a situation properly, which tends to have a snowball-rolling-downhill effect: the problem becomes worse with time.</p>
<p>Also remember, as the famous Captain Jean-Luc Picard of <em class="italic">Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> said: “A lie of omission is still a lie.” There will be times when you have to deliver bad news to higher-ups, and you may be reluctant to do so because you know that, unfortunately, sometimes the messenger gets shot, as the saying (sort of!) goes. Still, being a responsible team player means delivering that news so that decision-makers have all the information they need to make decisions. But again, learning to soften the blow can be very helpful. Telling a manager that a project is at risk of failure may be accurate, but it also may not be appreciated. Instead, you might say that while there are some delays, and the level of risk to the project has risen, steps are being taken to address that risk. As long as that statement is true, that may come across a bit better.</p>
<p>But there may also be situations where the blow can’t really be softened because the reality of the situation doesn’t allow it. For example, you may simply have to tell the manager that there’s no way the project can be accomplished on time and there’s nothing that can be done to avoid that. This certainly isn’t an easy thing to tell someone in charge, but another aspect of being a team player and taking responsibility is “speaking truth to power”, as the saying goes. You just have to step into the breach, deliver the news, and perhaps take your lumps for it.</p>
<p>Even still, take care with how you word the news. It’s probably not going to help anyone if you just blurt out “This project is doomed!” even if it might be true. Instead, maybe say something like “Given our current timeline and resource levels, I can’t see a way we can bring this project to a successful completion”.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-287"><a id="_idTextAnchor287"/>Being social without being TOO social</h2>
<p>The modern <a id="_idIndexMarker1034"/>world is almost defined by social media. From X (formerly Twitter) to Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and many others, nowadays people are far more open about their lives than ever before. This can be a wonderful thing: we get to be exposed to other perspectives and other life experiences, and, of course, we can very often be entertained!</p>
<p>But social media can also aid you in your job search and your career evolution. Sites such as LinkedIn can be a great help in finding jobs and building your network, as discussed in <a href="B18315_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor219"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>. But whether it’s LinkedIn, Snapchat, or another platform, you must take care with what you share because, as they say, the internet never forgets. What you put out there can be found by just about anyone, and if it’s not flattering it can have negative consequences for your job prospects as well as your career growth.</p>
<p>There aren’t any solid rules here because it’s tough to know for sure what might be a problem for any other person. The best advice I think is to simply be careful and before you post anything at all, ask yourself: will this portray me in a positive light? Is this something I would ever want to have to explain to an employer? To be clear, not all companies look at your social media. But these days, you can never be sure who will, so it’s better to play it safe.</p>
<p>Putting that aside, social media can also benefit you. For example, if you’re constantly interacting with other developers, even famous ones sometimes, you have the opportunity to learn and also possibly get a foot in the door. A positive interaction with someone can come back to aid you later when you’re hunting for a job. An honest, open, and productive debate about a specific technology could get you noticed.</p>
<p>For some context, many, many years ago, I was approached to write my first book primarily because of conversations I had on social media. A publisher took notice of the way I was able to present myself, did some research on me, found my personal site with some articles I wrote, and thought I might make a good author. It wasn’t anything I pursued or honestly even considered, but you never know when a good social interaction might lead down an unexpected path.</p>
<p>Finally, remember that unless explicitly authorized, you are not speaking for your employer online. Take care in what you reveal about your work situation in discussions. It’s perfectly acceptable, for example, to debate someone about a given technology position online, and even to use your work experience in general terms, but it’s usually not a great idea to be overly critical of your employer online. Revealing too much specific information about how your company does things may not only be frowned upon but could conceivably turn into a legal issue. Your opinions are your own, and you have every right to express them, but where that opinion intersects with your work life is an area you have to be careful about. In general, the less said that can be tied to your employer explicitly, the better. If you <em class="italic">have</em> to involve something from work in a public discussion, generalize it as much as possible to get your point across without revealing anything your employer may not appreciate being revealed.</p>
<p>The bottom line is to view social media as something that can be beneficial to you, but also as something you should be careful with. As with most things, striving for a balance between not being involved at all and over-sharing your entire life is probably a good general guideline. And remember that what you put out there could be seen by anyone at any time, so if you aren’t using social media properly then you might find your relationship with your team unexpectedly impacted negatively.</p>
<p>Another part <a id="_idIndexMarker1035"/>of fitting in with a team involves continuing to grow your technical skills. Especially in this field, which changes rapidly, you’ll have no real choice but to learn continuously, so let’s discuss that now.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-288"><a id="_idTextAnchor288"/>Learning never stops</h1>
<p>All the way <a id="_idIndexMarker1036"/>back in <a href="B18315_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, I mentioned that “learning to learn” is a key requirement of this field. However, it’s not enough in most cases to count solely on your actual working hours to be sufficient. The simple fact is that the pace of change in software development, including web development, is such that if you take a step off the train even for a little while, you can fall behind in a hurry.</p>
<p>Back when I started, websites were simple things. It was just plain old HTML, CSS, and JS. You could very easily view the source of any website and see how things were done. There wasn’t any real sort of tooling to learn, you just popped open Notepad or whatever text editor you had on hand and started hacking. That was in the early-to-mid 90s.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long before libraries like jQuery hit the scene, and then you had to learn those. Frameworks started to pop up, names such as Struts and <strong class="bold">JavaServer Faces</strong> (<strong class="bold">JSF</strong>). Though<a id="_idIndexMarker1037"/> those were Java-specific and not frontend libraries, they changed the way you developed applications in both relatively small and very large ways. Again, keeping up was a challenge.</p>
<p>At some point, probably around 2010, I’d say, there began to be an explosion of new frameworks, toolkits, libraries, developer tools, and all new ways to write both frontend and backend code (though the frontend has probably seen much more change overall). At some point, it <a id="_idIndexMarker1038"/>became virtually impossible to know everything.</p>
<p>But you still have to kind of try and do exactly that: know everything!</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-289"><a id="_idTextAnchor289"/>Specializing versus generalizing</h2>
<p>Naturally, you won’t <a id="_idIndexMarker1039"/>ever know everything. If you spend time learning React, then you might not know Angular very well (though they overlap a fair bit in terms of concepts, so knowing one at least gives you a leg-up on the other). If you focus on Node for your backend code, then you may not know Java as well. It’s always a trade-off because, unlike Doctor Strange in the Marvel cinematic universe, you probably don’t have the Eye of Agamotto to effectively give yourself infinite time to learn!</p>
<p>Some developers are specialists. They will focus on one or two key technologies or technology areas (frontend versus backend is a common demarcation) and not know too much beyond that. That’s perfectly fine if you find yourself drawn to a given set of technologies. As long as they are in demand then you’ll probably be able to find gainful employment with that limited scope.</p>
<p>Even if you do specialize, it’s still extremely helpful, even expected, that you’ll have <em class="italic">some</em> knowledge beyond your specialty. So, while you can focus on a few things, you still need to put some time into learning beyond those things, if for no other reason than to provide context for your specialties. That means you must figure out how to learn new things.</p>
<p>Other developers though—myself included—take a different tact and prefer to be generalists. We shoot for breath of depth, knowing a reasonable amount about many things, but not necessarily being an expert in any (in reality, we usually tend to have a few “favorites” that we are experts in, but even the skills we’re experts in might shift a bit over time as we use them more or less). This tends to be a better path in terms of employment simply because you won’t be artificially limiting which jobs you can apply to based on your skill set. Not only is it generally better for employment, but it also tends to be more enjoyable as long as you’re someone who appreciates the challenge and enjoys a broader mixture of tasks.</p>
<p>So, two things to keep in mind whether you see yourself as a generalist or a specialist are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn enough about as much as possible to at least have context around as many topics as possible, but perhaps focus on a few if you want to be a specialist</li>
<li>Figure out how you learn best and most efficiently</li>
</ul>
<p>That last point is important because we don’t all learn the same way or to the same level of efficiency <a id="_idIndexMarker1040"/>for a given approach to learning. You have to figure out what your personal learning style is.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-290"><a id="_idTextAnchor290"/>Determining your learning style</h2>
<p>So, which way of learning <a id="_idIndexMarker1041"/>works best and most efficiently for you? Is it as simple as reading technical news sites? Or maybe blog posts? What about self-directed learning sites? Do you need videos or is reading sufficient? Do you need hands-on experience or do you just “soak it all up like a sponge” just by seeing something?</p>
<p>For me, I’ve learned that reading works much better for me than watching videos, for example, and then immediately experimenting with what I learned. I think that’s probably because I’m more in control of the pace when I read, but I’m not sure. The reason doesn’t matter so much, just the understanding of what (usually) works best for me does, but I had to figure that out over time.</p>
<p>While there are no easy, simple ways to figure out your learning style, there are some general pointers I can provide that should help:</p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic">Experiment with different methods</em>: This is fairly obvious, but sometimes people think they already know their learning style and miss out on ones that actually work better for them. Give various learning formats a try. Read books or articles, watch tutorial videos on YouTube, attend workshops or classes, or simply do practical side projects, and then take note of how you feel during each method and the degree to which you retain the knowledge afterward.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Self-reflection</em>: After trying each method, reflect on a few key aspects. First, were you engaged the entire time or did your mind wander? Clearly, being able to remain engaged is necessary for proper learning. Next is retention. When you think back on what you (supposedly) learned, how much of it can you recall? The more, the better (though keep in mind that few people retain every detail, so be kind to yourself when you evaluate this). Were you able to take the knowledge and apply it practically by, perhaps, writing a small app with the new knowledge? The information we gain tends to not solidify in our brains until we use it, so this is a key question.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Feedback analysis</em>: If possible, get feedback on your progress as you learn with any given method. For example, if you’re learning by attending an online training course, see if there are assessments or quizzes to gauge your understanding as you go through it. If you’re actually learning, then you should generally be able to do well on such quizzes.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Comfort vs. challenge</em>: Identify if you prefer learning in a comfortable or challenging<a id="_idIndexMarker1042"/> environment. Some people do much better in more relaxed, self-paced, solitary settings. But others need the structure and interaction of a classroom, for example, to be led through the work. Neither is inherently better than the other, it’s whatever works best for you.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Learn by doing</em>: Building stuff is kind of a key requirement in the web development field. Failing to do so will—unless you’re a truly exceptional learner—be required. As you learn and then build stuff, be it something real on the job or just a personal project, focus on how much you learn by doing versus just consuming information and then tailor your time accordingly.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Community learning</em>: Not only are some people more comfortable in group settings but they also learn much better that way, the back-and-forth with others being of great aid to them. Seek out places where you can learn collaboratively, be that classrooms, online chat rooms, or discussion forums, and see if this sort of interaction boosts your learning.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Varying complexity</em>: See how your mind does with simple versus complex tasks and topics. Some people do better learning more straightforward topics one way, maybe by reading tutorials, but for more complex topics, they require hands-on experience for it to sink in.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Consistency and adaptability</em>: Track how consistent you are with each method over time. You might start well with video tutorials but find that your interest wanes faster than with reading and you’ll need to adjust as you discover this.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Time management</em>: Of course, none of this matters much if you can’t find the time for learning, so it’s worth considering how each learning style fits into your schedule. Uninterrupted learning in any form is almost always better than constant interruptions, so ensuring you can carve out enough uninterrupted time is critical.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Feedback loop</em>: After choosing a method, revisit your choice periodically, don’t assume what once worked best for you still does. Also note that learning styles can evolve, and what works today might not be as effective tomorrow. I mentioned earlier that I learn best when I can read something, which I do alone, but there was a time when I thought I did better in a classroom setting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind too that<a id="_idIndexMarker1043"/> it’s not uncommon to have a combination of learning style preferences rather than a single one that’s always best. You can certainly blend various styles to create a personalized learning strategy that keeps you both engaged and learning effectively.</p>
<p>I’ve mentioned putting knowledge to use in a practical way a few times, and I want to expand on that a bit into the concept of personal projects.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-291"><a id="_idTextAnchor291"/>Building personal projects</h2>
<p>One thing I always<a id="_idIndexMarker1044"/> strongly encourage, regardless of whether you want to be a specialist or a generalist and regardless of your preferred learning style, is to spend some personal time focusing and experimenting on a pet project.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter <em class="italic">what</em> you build, so long as you build <em class="italic">something</em>. However, when you choose a project, one definite requirement is that it is something that will hold your interest. For me, writing an app that calculates fuel compression ratios for cars wouldn’t hold my interest because I’ve never been a car guy. But one that catalogs my vintage video game collection would absolutely hold my interest from start to finish! Anything that will be a bit of a challenge without being a huge time sink because, after all, this is your personal time we’re talking about, and you should always treat that as precious.</p>
<p>As well as choosing a project that you’re interested in, you need to choose something that is the right combination of difficult enough to be challenging but not so difficult that it will become frustrating. This, of course, can be tricky to figure out, especially early on when you don’t have a lot of experience to know when something with be difficult or not.</p>
<p>Given that, I’m going<a id="_idIndexMarker1045"/> to suggest one type of project that I always suggest and that I almost consider a magic bullet-type of project!</p>
<h3>A magic type of personal project: games!</h3>
<p>One unusual type o<a id="_idIndexMarker1046"/>f project I almost recommend to people is to write games. That sounds weird when most of us probably aren’t going to be professional game developers. But the reason is that having written so many myself, I understand what such a project brings to the table.</p>
<p>Writing a game requires you to touch on a great many topics in computer science, including algorithms, networking (depending on the type of game), AI, data structures, optimization, debugging, and so much more. When you make a game, regardless of the technology involved, you confront a lot of the same sort of problems you’ll confront on the job building any other software, website, or web app.</p>
<p>Games can be written in any technology too, which makes them ideal for experimenting with something. I’ve written games in BASIC, C/C++, Java, Pascal, PHP, HTML/CSS/JS, React, and Vue. I even wrote a game in COBOL way back in high school!</p>
<p>And perhaps the best thing about a game project is that games are, by design, fun! Therefore, shouldn’t they be fun to build too? Well, it turns out they are… or, at least, can be. As with any project, you must balance the challenge with not driving yourself crazy.</p>
<p>As a manager of mine once said, you don’t need to build the Taj Mahal right off the bat. This is true for a game project, or really any other kind of game. If you try to build World of Warcraft right away, you’re assuredly going to fail because that’s a highly complex game. But, if you first just build a game where all you do is walk around, well, that’s the foundation right there! You can then add enemies to fight, spells to cast, and whatever else your imagination dreams up, all on top of that foundation.</p>
<p>Plus, a game project for the purpose of learning doesn’t need to be original, or even <em class="italic">good</em>! In fact, I often suggest to people to simply copy a game they like, preferably a simple one, or if they really like a complex one, then at least boil it down to its very basics to start. Go ahead and make a Frogger clone or Pac-Man rip-off that just uses squares and circles instead of real graphics. Even if it doesn’t look good, it can still be a fully functional game that you can learn from by building (of course, if you’re practicing your graphic design skills, then maybe you’ll want to spend some time on the graphics too).</p>
<p>As you work on a game though, think about the concepts you’re implementing and how they can relate to your day job. If you know you need to learn React for your job, then use React to<a id="_idIndexMarker1047"/> build a game. If you know that you need to use Redux with React for state management then do that in the game too even if it might not be your first choice. In a way, make a game of building the game! Use the tools, technologies, and techniques you’ll need on the job to build the game too.</p>
<p>Even if no one ever sees your game either, that’s totally fine. It can absolutely just be for you. And you may never play it yourself even. But again, it doesn’t have to be good or even fun in the end if you learn from the experience, and I promise you will learn from these types of projects, without even realizing it sometimes.</p>
<p>But maybe you <em class="italic">will</em> want to show someone. After all, you may rightly be proud of your work and what you learned from it and want to show it off. Interacting with other people is the realm <a id="_idIndexMarker1048"/>of communication, which is another one of those soft skills we’re concerned with in this chapter, so let’s talk about that next.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-292"><a id="_idTextAnchor292"/>Moving beyond smoke signals with good communication skills</h1>
<p>Working as part of<a id="_idIndexMarker1049"/> a team naturally means being able to communicate effectively, whether that be in written form or in person and whether it’s a design meeting, a presentation, or any other situations where we need to express ideas to others. When done well, it fosters cohesiveness in the team, which translates to better performance.</p>
<p>Some facets of good communication skills are relatively obvious. For example, keeping things professional in tone is something most people inherently understand. It’s perfectly acceptable to make jokes in a professional environment, but quoting material from the likes of Eddie Murphy, Andrew “Dice” Clay, Dave Chapelle, Richard Pryor, and Ricky Gervais will likely not be appropriate (even if you find it funny).</p>
<p>Others, however, are a little harder to catch. Here are some key points to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic">Clarity and conciseness</em>: I’ll make an admission here: around the office, I’m known as the “long email” guy. I like to give full, complete explanations with as few assumptions about what the person I’m talking to knows. As a general concept, this isn’t a bad approach. However, brevity is also something that isn’t a bad approach. Communication, written or otherwise, should be done as clearly and as concisely as possible. People’s time is valuable, so you want to get to the point quickly. However, you must take care not to take this too far or you risk leaving out information people need. This is a skill I’m still working on myself!</li>
<li><em class="italic">Active listening</em>: When speaking directly to someone, engage with them and what they’re saying without immediately jumping to conclusions or responses. This isn’t always easy because humans are emotional creatures and those emotions oftentimes get the better of our thinking brains. But, doing so will show respect to the person you’re talking to as well as usually leading to a deeper understanding for both parties about the issues or ideas being discussed.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Empathy and understanding</em>: Always practice empathy and understanding when engaging with others in any form! A big part of this is respecting the perspectives of others. Especially in today’s diverse workplaces, you have to constantly be trying to recognize where others are coming from and work to find common ground in discussions and problem-solving. Another big part of this is when people ask “stupid” questions. As the saying goes, the only stupid question is the one you don’t ask, and I agree with this wholeheartedly. Never be ashamed to ask what you think might be a stupid question, and conversely, be kind to others who ask them of you. Try to help as best you can, without judgment, even if of yourself!</li>
<li><em class="italic">Consistent and open communication</em>: Communication that is regular tends to be better because it fosters relationships between people. After all, communication is a skill like any other, so it requires practice to improve over time. It also helps to avoid misunderstandings, or more precisely, it allows misunderstandings to happen when the stakes aren’t as high and can be corrected more easily.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Written communication skills</em>: Specifically regarding written communication methods, such as emails, reports, and documentation, by their nature, you have time to do them right, so take advantage of this! Read and re-read what you write several<a id="_idIndexMarker1050"/> times. Use whatever proofing tools are available to you and work to make it as direct and informative as possible. As novelists often say, don’t be afraid to kill your darlings. What that means is don’t be afraid to cut out words that aren’t bringing value as you re-read them. Just because you took the time to write them doesn’t mean they need to be there in the end!</li>
<li><em class="italic">Non-verbal communication</em>: Always remember that not all communication is direct. Paying attention to body language and tone, both in yourself and others, can yield powerful insights. These can often convey more than words and are crucial in understanding the full context of a conversation. For example, if you are describing your approach to a coding problem and the person you’re talking to folds their arms across their chest, that <em class="italic">might</em> indicate that they are not receptive to what you’re saying. Body language is not an exact science though, so you can’t treat such a signal as an absolute, but given that cue, you might decide to alter your approach somewhat. There are entire books about body language that can provide tons of useful information. One top pick that you might consider is titled <em class="italic">The Definitive Book of Body Language</em> by Barbara Pease and Allan Pease.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Feedback (both giving and receiving)</em>: Constructive feedback is essential for growth and improvement, and that goes both ways. Being open to receiving it helps you improve yourself obviously, and giving it in a way that is constructive and not personal is a key communication skill. Always remember to criticize ideas and not people. For example, saying “I’m not sure this approach will yield positive results” is a little better than “I’m not sure you chose the right approach here” because the former highlights the approach while the latter emphasizes the idea that someone made a mistake.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Conflict resolution</em>: No matter how hard you try, you will of course encounter disagreements <a id="_idIndexMarker1051"/>with people sometimes, as well as people who just aren’t very pleasant to deal with. Handling such people with calmness and a focus on solutions rather than blame can maintain a positive work environment. Taking the high road is a skill all on its own that needs to be practiced because, again, we’re emotional creatures, and our first instinct is often to react emotionally. You have to practice fighting that reaction and keeping things intellectual and polite even when the other participant doesn’t reciprocate.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Cultural sensitivity</em>: In a global work environment—which is exceptionally common in the IT field—being aware of and sensitive to cultural differences in communication styles is vital. Interesting, I ran into this while writing this book. Though I'm American, Packt is not a U.S based company, so on a few occasions, I said things in a way that wasn't quite clear to someone outside the U.S, or used pop culture references that didn't quite translate. You have to always check yourself with things such as this, because while not being understood is one thing, you can easily offend someone who may have different life views and values, and that's a much bigger issue.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Proper utilization of communication channels and technologies</em>: Use communication tools effectively, whether it’s email, messaging apps, or good old-fashioned telephones. Always choose the technology that is appropriate for your needs. If you have a question that you don’t need an immediate answer to, then use email. If you do need an immediate answer but it’s not super-critical, a messaging app such as Microsoft Teams or Discord might be preferred. I think it’s reasonable to say that a lot of people these days prefer technologies other than talking on the phone a lot of the time, so reserve that for more critical situations (unless, of course, you know you’re calling someone who simply enjoys a little conversation, in which case it may be advantageous to engage that person to build rapport).</li>
<li><em class="italic">Tailor your message</em>: Always keep your audience in mind! The way you communicate with technical people is often not the same way you’d communicate with a senior leader. For one thing, they have different concerns. A senior leader probably just needs the broad strokes of a problem and what the consequences<a id="_idIndexMarker1052"/> of it not being corrected are, whereas technical people will need more detail to come up with solutions. And of course, if you’re writing a message to someone you have a more extensive personal relationship with, then you might be able to be a little less formal than someone else (but still within professional boundaries while on company time).</li>
<li><em class="italic">Continuous improvement</em>: Always look for ways to improve your communication skills. Take advantage of any sort of training your employer might offer, or just seek out YouTube videos from experts to get specific tips you can implement. No one is perfect—myself included, as I mentioned earlier—but the only constant for us all is the need to continuously evaluate and improve ourselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>One last thing I want to touch on is somewhat of a general thought that I’ve touched on a little bit already<a id="_idIndexMarker1053"/> but that probably deserves a little more focus, and that’s the marketplace of ideas.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-293"><a id="_idTextAnchor293"/>Shopping in the marketplace of ideas</h2>
<p>The <strong class="bold">marketplace of ideas</strong> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker1054"/>metaphor that describes the need for open, public discourse about<a id="_idIndexMarker1055"/> ideas. The goal is to determine the truth and value of different ideas, ideologies, and perspectives. We’re not talking about truth in the sense of a court of law; instead, it’s the notion that people will often have conflicting ideas and it’s our job to vet them openly and honestly, discard the ones deemed to be of no value, keep the ones deemed to have high value, or, as often winds up being the case, blend ideas into something new on the fly.</p>
<p>The idea behind the marketplace of ideas demands that people be able to express themselves without fear of being ridiculed and that the ideas expressed will be debated and challenged without undue restrictions. In the end, those ideas that the group deems to be the most “truthful”—where “truth” is defined as the idea that most of the group agrees with—will be seen as most beneficial and will prevail over others, and this is a very natural and productive way to accomplish both technical and non-technical tasks.</p>
<p>To give a somewhat concrete example, let’s say you’re starting a new project and you’re trying to determine which frontend framework to use. You may be advocating for React, while someone else is advocating for Angular. You would state your position and explain why you feel React is the best choice. Perhaps you’ll make arguments about its user base being larger than Angular’s, that there are more developer resources available to support it, and that its comparative simplicity will make developing the project faster. The Angular advocate may debate those points, both in absolute terms and in relation to Angular itself.</p>
<p>Part of the debate in the marketplace, so to speak, may involve both of you going off and creating a prototype to demonstrate your preferred approach. I was in a situation like that a long time ago, where I was advocating for an approach that used some then-new technologies including AJAX and a service-based architecture. These ideas weren’t common yet, but I saw the utility in them. However, another architect at the time preferred a tool called Flex, a now-defunct product of Adobe.</p>
<p>We wrote up a document to describe our approach and our reasoning behind it. We then spent a few days building a demonstrator app using our chosen technologies. Eventually, we all got together—myself, the other architect, some other developers, and our manager—and we presented what we had. There was some debate in the room that day, but eventually, not to toot my own horn, my approach won out, and since then it’s been the standard way of developing apps both at my company and outside (and Flex went the way of the Dodo!).</p>
<p>That situation demonstrates how the marketplace of ideas worked. Myself and the other architect were never arguing heatedly, we were never attacking each other. We certainly would point out the flaws in each other’s approaches and how our own had benefits over the other, but that’s the way it’s supposed to work. Everyone got a chance to express their ideas and defend their point of view, but eventually, the marketplace decided which had more value.</p>
<p>None of this works without mutual respect, the ability to acknowledge that your own ideas aren’t the only ones, and the willingness to say that they might not even be the best. There isn’t any special skill to be learned here, it’s simply having a certain level of intellectual maturity. No one typically enjoys being wrong or having their ideas deemed less worthy than others, but that’s the way the world works, and you must accept it. The best advice I can offer is to try your best to keep emotion out of the proceedings. That, and try not to get emotionally attached to your ideas. As long as everyone is on a level playing field and comes at things the same way, then, as mentioned earlier, you’ll be “attacking” things and not people, which generally allows most people to keep their emotions in check.</p>
<p>The final topic I want to<a id="_idIndexMarker1056"/> discuss in the realm of soft skills is a bit of a stretch, honestly, but I think it dovetails from the previous topics, certainly from communication skills. That topic is development methodologies, but primarily something called Agile.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-294"><a id="_idTextAnchor294"/>Exploring the Agile software development methodology</h1>
<p>When we develop any <a id="_idIndexMarker1057"/>kind of software, including websites, we use what’s known <a id="_idIndexMarker1058"/>as a <strong class="bold">methodology</strong>. That’s a fancy way of saying a defined approach to how we’re going to get our work done (because the alternative is to just start hacking code together randomly, and that rarely turns out well). Today, the most popular development methodology is something called Agile.</p>
<p>But before we can talk about Agile, you have to have some idea of what came before—the thing that made people realize Agile might be a better approach—and that is primarily another <a id="_idIndexMarker1059"/>methodology called <strong class="bold">Waterfall</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-295"><a id="_idTextAnchor295"/>Going over the falls in a barrel: The Waterfall methodology</h2>
<p>In the Waterfall<a id="_idIndexMarker1060"/> methodology, befor<a id="_idIndexMarker1061"/>e you start building anything, you spend a lot of time designing. This involves spending a lot of time talking to clients, discovering their needs, and critically writing up documents that describe exactly what’s going to be built and how. In fact, documentation is one of the main things that differentiates Waterfall from Agile.</p>
<p>In Waterfall, you’ll create documents such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Business requirements document</strong> (<strong class="bold">BRD</strong>): This is a document that outlines the business<a id="_idIndexMarker1062"/> objectives of the project at a high level. This type of document is written in non-technical terms as it’s concerned with what the thing you’re building should do from a business perspective, what its scope is, and what the expected benefits are.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Functional requirements document</strong> (<strong class="bold">FRD</strong>), sometimes <a id="_idIndexMarker1063"/>referred to as <strong class="bold">system requirements specification</strong> (<strong class="bold">SRS</strong>): This <a id="_idIndexMarker1064"/>type of document describes what the software will do in detail and typically includes things such as user stories and use cases.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Technical requirements document</strong> (<strong class="bold">TRD</strong>), sometimes <a id="_idIndexMarker1065"/>referred to as <strong class="bold">software design document</strong> (<strong class="bold">SDD</strong>): This is a <a id="_idIndexMarker1066"/>document that includes specified technical direction, things such as overall architecture, technology stack, database design, modules to be built, services interfaces to provide, and so forth. This is ultimately the document that a developer will base their code on.</li>
<li>There are other types of documents without specific names (or at least acronyms), including user manuals to describe how to use the product; system administration manuals to explain how people who manage the system should do their tasks; project plans that describe the major milestones and tasks that need to be accomplished for the project to be completed, with estimates, dates and the people responsible for each task; and risk management plans that outlines potential risks and strategies for addressing them during the development of the project.</li>
</ul>
<p>These documents, and possibly others, are the output of Waterfall, and, most importantly, they are done upfront. No development begins until they are all written, reviewed, revised, and approved. If that takes a year, then no code is written (aside from perhaps some prototypes and design samples) for a year.</p>
<p>At first blush, that seems logical, doesn’t it? People need to know what they’re building before they can start building it, right? And it makes sense that everyone involved should have a clear picture of the end goal and the steps involved in getting there, does it not?</p>
<p>But the problem is twofold. First, the time it takes to write all that documentation is “lost” in the sense that development typically doesn’t begin until it’s done. Obviously, that means no one can see anything until much later in the process, not even a partially-built system for a long<a id="_idIndexMarker1067"/> time. Second—and this <a id="_idIndexMarker1068"/>is perhaps the bigger issue—is that no matter how good your documentation process is, people often don’t know what they need! Or they sometimes realize things they didn’t specify correctly up front as the product is developed, as they see parts of it completed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, with Waterfall, it’s usually the case that the people who will be using the product don’t see anything until it’s done, or at least mostly done, at which point making changes, especially those that represent core changes to things underpinning the entire product, are very costly or even impossible sometimes. If it takes a year to document everything and then another year to build it, no one is seeing if the documentation matches reality until close to two years later, at which point making changes may not be possible, so now you spent all that time, money, and effort and wound up with something that doesn’t meet the needs for one reason or another.</p>
<p>For these reasons, Waterfall has largely fallen out of favor. It isn’t gone entirely, some companies do still use it, and it can be beneficial in some cases where it’s easier to do up-front design because it allows you to better estimate a project’s timeline and makes things a bit more predictable. However, it largely has given way to the Agile methodology for <a id="_idIndexMarker1069"/>most <a id="_idIndexMarker1070"/>projects, so let’s talk about Agile now.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-296"><a id="_idTextAnchor296"/>Being Agile in your development projects</h2>
<p>Whereas Waterfall is <a id="_idIndexMarker1071"/>a sequential process (documentation and then development), the <strong class="bold">Agile</strong> methodology is iterative, incremental, and often parallel. Instead of designing everything at the start and spending a ton of time writing documentation, Agile favors building small pieces of a project and then iteratively updating them as needed to get them closer to what is needed over time. Then, the next small part of the project can begin (or two small parts may be developed in parallel, depending on resource availability, but it’s an iterative, incremental process either way).</p>
<h3>The goals of Agile</h3>
<p>The concept of Agile <a id="_idIndexMarker1072"/>began in 2001 with the Agile Manifesto, formulated by a group of software developers. This document describes the key principles of Agile software development.</p>
<p>There are four core values described by the Agile Manifesto:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Favor individuals and interactions over processes and tools</strong>: Rather than adhering<a id="_idIndexMarker1073"/> strictly to specific tools, the skills of people, teamwork, and communication are emphasized. This value puts focus on the importance of collaboration and a team-based approach—you know, soft skills!</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Favor working software over comprehensive documentation</strong>: This value puts the focus on delivering functional software rather than spending extensive time on documenting every detail, especially when done up front as with Waterfall. This doesn’t mean documentation is unnecessary. Instead, it means that producing working software is a higher priority and a better measure of progress than documentation.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Favor customer collaboration over contract negotiation</strong>: Involving customers as active participants throughout the development process is the point of this value. It underscores the importance of customer feedback and adapting to their changing needs (or understanding) rather than relying solely on initial contract terms.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Favor responding to change over following a rock-solid plan</strong>: This value explains how we should embrace change throughout the development process rather than rigidly sticking to a pre-defined plan. This means being flexible and adaptable<a id="_idIndexMarker1074"/> to ensure the final product meets the evolving needs of customers and the market.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond the core<a id="_idIndexMarker1075"/> values, there are also twelve principles described by the Agile Manifesto that elaborate on the core values:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Customer satisfaction</strong>: Customers<a id="_idIndexMarker1076"/> who see continuous delivery of even small bits of functionality tend to be happier customers.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Welcome changing requirements</strong>: Rather than view changing requirements as a problem, Agile sees it as a plus, allowing customers to adapt to the market faster for competitive advantage.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Deliver working software frequently</strong>: The more often you can deliver working pieces of functionality, the better for the customer, who can put them to use even if the whole product isn’t yet done.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Close, daily cooperation between stakeholders and developers</strong>: This allows for better decision-making and alignment of ever-changing goals.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Build projects around motivated individuals</strong>: When you give teams the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done, they tend to perform better and do so with more personal fulfillment.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">The most efficient and effective method of conveying information</strong>: Face-to-face interactions tend to be best, but in the modern virtualized world, teams can also work effectively remotely as long as they have good communication skills.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Working software as the primary measure of progress</strong>: This one is self-explanatory and has been discussed already. After all, you can do everything else right, but if the product you deliver doesn’t actually work, then it hardly matters, does it?</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Agile processes promote sustainable development</strong>: The stakeholders, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely when properly using Agile methodology.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design</strong>: This helps to enhance agility by building on a solid technical foundation the whole way through.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Simplicity</strong>: The art of maximizing the amount of work not done is essential! Code not developed is code that can’t have bugs, after all, so not over-engineering is a key technical goal, not just when doing Agile but generally.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">The best architectures, requirements, and designs</strong>: Self-organizing teams that guide themselves tend to produce better artifacts.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">At regular intervals, the team reflects on how it’s doing</strong>: The team should periodically look at what they’ve done, how they’ve done it, and how things have <a id="_idIndexMarker1077"/>progressed and tweak the process as appropriate to support continued process improvement.</li>
</ul>
<p>These values and<a id="_idIndexMarker1078"/> principles, and Agile broadly, have had a profound effect on how software, including websites, is created. They have enhanced team dynamics and brought the stakeholders into the process the whole iterative way through.</p>
<p>That iteration I’ve mentioned a few times supports one of the main goals of Agile, which is to be adaptive to changes. This is accomplished by developing small units and pieces of the larger project and critically getting that in front of people as soon as possible. That way, if the design wasn’t right, either because the business owners didn’t know exactly what they needed, the developer misunderstood a requirement, or whatever reason, only two weeks of effort was lost (and in most cases, it wasn’t completely lost). You can re-work the screen, iteratively, until it’s what is needed, all along adapting to any changes in requirements needed.</p>
<p>This only works when there is continuous collaboration between people, which is why I justify this discussion of development methodologies, mainly Agile, as a “soft skill”. I acknowledge I’m stretching the definition a bit here, but I think I can get away with it because Agile doesn’t work if you aren’t working hand-in-hand with people! If you aren’t constantly communicating and having a back-and-forth exchange of ideas, then Agile falls apart, and doing those things are soft skills in my book for sure.</p>
<p>By the same token, customer feedback during the development process is a key component of making this work. The way this is accomplished with Agile is in iterations called <strong class="bold">sprints</strong>. I’ll get into <a id="_idIndexMarker1079"/>more detail about sprints in the next section, but in short for now, they are a period of time—let’s say two weeks—where a small increment of work is done. Maybe during a given sprint, you implement one or two features out of the fifty you ultimately need, for example. The goal is to have something that can be deployed and ideally used for real at the end of every sprint so that customers can get immediate benefit from what you’re building as you go, even if not the full benefit of the full project being completed. They can then get hands-on experience and see where what was developed might not have been what they really needed, and that can feed back into the process and impact what you work on in the next sprint. Note that deploying after each sprint is definitely not a requirement of Agile, but the goal is that you <em class="italic">could</em> deploy at the end of every sprint.</p>
<p>One of the other <a id="_idIndexMarker1080"/>benefits of Agile is that testing is done throughout the process by necessity. As a screen is built, it can be tested while another is being built. Unlike with Waterfall, where testing is almost entirely done at the end, you again don’t need to wait to find out things are wrong in Agile until the end as with Waterfall.</p>
<p>Agile also shifts the focus—and to a large degree, control—onto the development team. It is typical for there to be a <strong class="bold">backlog</strong> of tickets; that is, a list of tasks to be accomplished. This backlog can be <em class="italic">groomed</em> by the stakeholders, meaning it can be arranged in priority order (usually, the tickets at the top of the backlog have been deemed most important). Ultimately, the development team decides what gets done in each sprint, pulling tickets from the backlog<a id="_idIndexMarker1081"/> during <strong class="bold">sprint planning</strong> sessions. There, they estimate each ticket and then decide how many tickets they believe can be done in the next sprint. Sometimes not all tickets will get done, and sometimes extra time will be available, at which point the next ticket from the backlog can be added to the sprint on the fly. Sometimes, the order of the backlog might be ignored for various reasons (for example, if there is a ticket that the team knows will be easy to do further down on the backlog, but they want to pull it into the sprint just to fill it up a bit).</p>
<p>Note too that in all of this, documentation is de-emphasized. Oh, to be sure, there still is documentation in most cases, but it’s built on the fly, along with the code to a large extent. It also often lives in the tickets used for each piece built rather than being separate artifacts, though that depends on how a given organization implements Agile. And that’s a common thread here: there’s more than one way to do Agile, no truly canonical “right” way. Teams will tweak aspects of it to meet their needs. In my projects, we tend to favor four-week sprints, for example. Some teams don’t do sprint review sessions (meetings after a sprint ends where you present your work to the stakeholders, discuss what went right and wrong during a sprint and what to do to improve the next one) while others do them religiously. It’s all fungible.</p>
<p>All of this combines to make Agile less predictable than Waterfall. You don’t usually know at the start how many sprints will be required, nor will you have a clear picture of what you’re building necessarily beyond some basics. If it sounds like chaos, it can be! But it’s controlled chaos, and it’s chaos that allows working code to get in front of people sooner, which <a id="_idIndexMarker1082"/>is probably the primary benefit of Agile.</p>
<p>The way Agile is implemented can vary from organization to organization, but most implementations tend to share a few key concepts, beginning with sprints.</p>
<h3>Understanding core Agile concepts</h3>
<p>As previously <a id="_idIndexMarker1083"/>mentioned, Agile uses the idea of sprints, which are small units of time—typically two weeks—where development is done. What usually happens is people design a small part of the application, perhaps a single screen out of many. This produces some degree of documentation as the designers and/or analysts write <em class="italic">just</em> enough documentation about only the specific tasks in the sprint that technical people need to implement it but far less than is typical with Waterfall.</p>
<p>Usually, every day during a sprint, you have a <strong class="bold">daily standup</strong> meeting. This, in some cases, is quite literal—the idea is to keep this meeting very short and sweet, and people tend to do that when they’re standing up. During it, each person goes around and quickly discusses what they worked on yesterday, what they plan to work on today, and if they have any blockers or issues that are keeping them from progressing (which the leader of the standup, the <strong class="bold">scrum master</strong>, will <a id="_idIndexMarker1084"/>try to help unblock by connecting them with the right person to address the issue).</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Agile vs. scrum</p>
<p class="callout">I dropped a term here that should be explained. Scrum is a specific form of Agile development, and it is probably the most predominant form, to the point where people tend to use the terms interchangeably. The main difference is that while Agile is a set of general philosophies and approaches to software development, Scrum refines Agile into specific roles (such as scrum master), specific ceremonies to perform (such as daily standups), and specific artifacts, such as the sprint backlog, which I’ll talk about shortly. Other forms of Agile are sometimes used though, including extreme programming and lean software development. So, keep in mind that Agile isn’t the same thing as Scrum, but also keep in mind that in most cases, owing to its popularity, Agile and Scrum can be used interchangeably in polite conversation.</p>
<p>But how do <a id="_idIndexMarker1085"/>people even know what they should work on? For that, a tracking system such as Jira (<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira</a>) is often used (see <em class="italic">Figure 11</em><em class="italic">.1</em>). For that screen, a ticket would be opened and the design details would be included. Then, the sprint begins, and a developer “picks up” that ticket to work on. Over the next two weeks, they develop it, often going back and forth with the designer (sometimes a business analyst). But ultimately, at the end of that two-week sprint, the goal is that the screen—and that screen alone—should be in a deployable state. Ideally, it is entirely done and correct, but that’s kind of the goal: deploy it and find out!</p>

<p>If changes are <a id="_idIndexMarker1086"/>made, a new ticket will typically be opened, and it will then be worked on in the next sprint. At the same time, the next screen may be worked on by another developer in the same way.</p>
<p>As work is completed, a <strong class="bold">burndown chart</strong> is <a id="_idIndexMarker1087"/>often produced, an example of which can be seen in <em class="italic">Figure 11</em><em class="italic">.2</em>. The X axis shows time, usually marked in days or sprints if an overall progress view is desired. The Y axis shows the amount of work remaining, most typically either tickets<a id="_idIndexMarker1088"/> or <strong class="bold">story points</strong>, which are an estimate of how relatively difficult and time-consuming a ticket is (a ticket estimated at 10 story points should, generally speaking, be deemed twice as hard and time-consuming as one estimated at 5 story points).</p>

<p>This chart will normally also have an ideal burndown line, which starts at the top of the Y axis and ends at zero, on the sprint or project’s end date. Finally, there will usually also be an actual burndown line, which shows the actual progress of the work done, starting from the total amount of work done and sloping downward as items are completed. These two lines allow you to see the relationship between what you planned to do and what you actually<a id="_idIndexMarker1089"/> got done during the sprint.</p>
<p>Still, what you’ll often find is that the two methodologies, Waterfall and Agile, can be combined to some degree, leading to the best of both worlds.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-297"><a id="_idTextAnchor297"/>Hybridizing Waterfall and Agile</h2>
<p>When you combine <a id="_idIndexMarker1090"/>Waterfall <a id="_idIndexMarker1091"/>and Agile, the goal is to accentuate the strengths of each while mitigating the weakness of the other. Since both approaches have their pluses and minuses, the idea is to wind up with as many pluses and as few minuses as possible, which can result in a methodology better than either alone.</p>
<p>In the hybrid methodology, there is some up-front design work and documentation—more than is typical in Agile alone—but once coding begins, it takes on a more Agile and iterative approach in that you work in sprints; you may release after each sprint and may adapt to changes more than you would with Waterfall alone.</p>
<p>Often, with a hybrid approach, there are set milestones that wouldn’t typically be present with Agile alone. For example, you may say up front that the goal is to do a release after six two-week sprints. That milestone is a concrete goal the team works toward rather than them just iterating until they feel the software is ready to be released completely or releasing it after each sprint.</p>
<p>While Agile favors minimal documentation and Waterfall emphasizes it, a hybrid approach seeks to strike a balance. That means you may see some documents such as BRDs but maybe no TRDs. The documentation deemed most essential might be built up front and in detail as with Waterfall, but everything else can be built minimally and kept in tickets.</p>
<p>Customer involvement is another difference. Instead of waiting until near the end of development to show the customers what you’ve built as with Waterfall, and rather than having them see every piece built as with Agile, you instead may only show them what you’ve built at predefined checkpoints. For example, if you have one hundred screens to build, you may group them into discrete pieces of functionality, where each group is maybe a dozen screens, and use each group as a checkpoint to show what you’ve built.</p>
<p>A hybrid approach<a id="_idIndexMarker1092"/> can <a id="_idIndexMarker1093"/>also help manage risk better. Any development project involves some form of risk, be that loss of time or loss of money if the end product doesn’t meet the needs of the client. This risk is greater for Agile generally because, unlike Waterfall, there isn’t as much focus spent on specifying everything properly at the start. But, doing <em class="italic">some</em> of that work upfront before beginning an Agile project can help cut down some of that risk since you’re more likely to catch fundamental problems at that point, the type of problems that tend to be more difficult and costly to fix later. For the same reason, the ability of Agile to respond to changes more efficiently means that there isn’t as much risk of discovering issues in the middle that put the entire project at risk as there can be with Waterfall.</p>
<p>Using a hybrid approach still requires top-notch communication skills (see, those soft skills again!) and still allows for customization by the team. In fact, because it’s mixing two methodologies, it’s probably even more important to customize the methodology according to the team’s needs and desires, where the team means the development team plus stakeholders. Part of this customization too is ensuring that the methodology aligns with the culture of the organization. Some companies are inherently more flexible while others are more rigid, so it makes sense that you would have to tailor your hybrid approach to align with that overall corporate mindset.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, whether you use Waterfall, Agile, or a hybrid approach, communication and working closely with people is the key! Those soft skills will get <em class="italic">a lot</em> of exercise with <a id="_idIndexMarker1094"/>Agile or <a id="_idIndexMarker1095"/>a hybrid methodology (less so with Waterfall, but really still plenty even there), so understanding that before you begin a project is important.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-298"><a id="_idTextAnchor298"/>Reviewing the roadmap</h1>
<p>We’re almost at the end now; just one more chapter to go after this! In <em class="italic">Figure 11</em><em class="italic">.3</em>, you can see the updated web developer roadmap:</p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.3: The roadmap with a few more boxes filled in</p>
<p>Okay, well, it’s just one box this time – <strong class="bold">Development Methodologies</strong> – but that means you know what’s going to be opened up in the next chapter since there are only three boxes left unopened (though the mystery of what they are is exciting, isn’t it?). So, don’t slow down now, just one more chapter to go!</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-299"><a id="_idTextAnchor299"/>Summary</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we talked about so-called “soft skills”—things that are non-technical in nature but that are just as important as technical skills. This includes things such as how to be a good team player and being kind to others while being open and honest, even when giving criticism. We discussed how being social can be a plus but that you must use caution and have limits, especially where social media is concerned.</p>
<p>We also talked about how part of being a good web developer is continually learning, but not everyone learns best the same way, so you have to be introspective to determine your preferred learning style. We discussed how putting your learning to use in personal projects is, if not a must, then certainly a good idea, and how games especially are a great—albeit unexpected—type of project to accomplish that with.</p>
<p>We then looked at how to build effective communication skills; things such as how to compose emails concisely but honestly, how direct verbal contact has many layers to it including body language, and about the marketplace of ideas and how successfully navigating it with respect is necessary.</p>
<p>Finally, we looked at development methodologies, with a specific focus on Agile. You saw how this involves a whole lot of soft skills (especially communication skills), why it’s beneficial versus Waterfall, and how a hybrid approach is often considered best.</p>
<p>In the next—and final—chapter, we’ll, in a sense, expand on the topic of continued learning because I know it to be of particular importance in this field of work. Hopefully, I can give you a bit more refined direction on how to ensure that your skills never grow stale and instead always remain current and, most importantly, marketable!</p>
