<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">We’ve spent a lot of time talking about the technical side of web development, how to get a job in the field, and some developmental topics to help you grow your career. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">But there’s another set of things that you need to be aware of to enjoy a fruitful career. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.3">These are things we call </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">soft skills.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1">What are soft skills? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.2">These are things such as your attitude, how to communicate with others effectively, socializing appropriately with co-workers, continuing the growth of your technical knowledge, and software development methodologies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.3">These are things that aren’t technical in nature and that you typically don’t learn in books or classrooms. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.4">You tend to learn them from the examples of others, and sometimes by trial and error. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.5">My goal is, hopefully, to remove as much of the error from that equation </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">as possible!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">Soft skills will not only help you get hired and be a good employee, but they also are vital to advancing your career. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.2">Even the best technicians will tend to plateau at some point in their career development if they lack soft skills. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.3">These skills become more important as you climb the ladder, but they’re always valuable, right from </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">rung one!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">In this chapter, we’ll cover </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1">the following:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">There’s no “I” </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1">in “team”</span></span></li>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-281"><a id="_idTextAnchor281"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.19.1">There’s no “I” in “Team”</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.20.1">I can boil this entire section down to just </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.21.1">seven words:</span></span></p>
<p><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.22.1">Be someone people want to </span></em><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.23.1">work with.</span></em></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.1">That sounds simple, and guess what? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.24.2">It actually </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.25.1">is</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.1"> simple! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.2">Of course, simple doesn’t necessarily mean easy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.26.3">But let’s talk about the simple </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.27.1">part first.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.28.1">Being someone </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1025"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.1">people want to work with means many things, but primarily it means being someone friendly and helpful, someone who can be relied on to get the job done and do so with a pleasant demeanor. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.2">However, this doesn’t automatically mean you have to be an outgoing, gregarious person. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.29.3">No; you can be quiet and reserved but still be seen as someone friendly to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.30.1">interact with.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.1">During the interview process, it’s important to keep this in mind because, at that point, you’re trying to sell yourself. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.2">One of the things you will be judged on is whether you seem like someone who knows how to work well with others. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.3">This is the cultural fit aspect of the interview. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.4">We almost always have to work with others, so it makes sense that we would want to enjoy doing so, or at the very least not mind doing so. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.31.5">Therefore, you must make a good impression during </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.32.1">an interview.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">In particular, make sure you smile most of the time, look people in the eye when you speak to them, pay them the attention they deserve given that they are effectively there to judge you, and generally stay in the moment with them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.2">You want to be attentive and not distracted, and you should answer questions </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">with enthusiasm.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">Of course, this all applies after you’ve gotten the job too! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.2">You have to remember that, as the saying goes, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">there is no “I” in “team”</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">, and part of that means ensuring you are making others comfortable around you. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">Never bring your work home because that can impact your home life, and by the same token, don’t bring your personal problems to work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.3">People don’t usually appreciate someone who dumps all their problems on them in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">the office.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">One of the best ways to be seen as a team player is to be someone who can help others whenever and however you can. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.2">Let’s touch on that </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1">a bit.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-282"><a id="_idTextAnchor282"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">Helping where you can</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">Being a team </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1026"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1">player, of course, is more than just being a friendly face. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.2">Always be the person that people can come to for help and who is willing to give their time to assist. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.3">It’s sometimes hard to remember that if you help someone get their work done, then you’ve still performed a service to your employer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.4">Of course, there is a balance that needs to be struck because we all have our own tasks to accomplish, so you must be careful not to give </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1">too</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1"> much </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">of yourself.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1">At first, it’s natural that you may not have much to offer others who have more experience. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.2">But you’d be surprised how just being friendly and approachable can result in people coming to you for help. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.3">And it makes sense: if you know that the curmudgeonly guy in the corner probably has the answer, you might still prefer to take a little more time working through a problem with someone more junior because that guy is just not pleasant to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">interact with.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">But also remember that just because you may not know as much doesn’t automatically mean you can’t help. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.2">Sometimes, it’s just that second set of eyes changing your perspective a little bit that is what you need to solve a problem. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.3">And even then, remember our discussion of rubber duck debugging and Stack Overflow in </span><a href="B18315_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor259"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">Chapter 10</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1">? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.2">Sometimes just being there to listen to someone explain a problem is all they need to figure it out on their own, so you will have done them a service just by being a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">good listener!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">Of course, it’s not </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1027"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">always about just listening; sometimes you have to give feedback. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.2">How you do that is part of being a good </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1">teammate too.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-283"><a id="_idTextAnchor283"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">Being kind when being critical</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">Eventually, in your</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1028"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1"> career, you’re not going to have any choice but to be critical of someone. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.2">More precisely, you’ll need to be critical of their work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.3">When this time comes, you will most likely have had others who have been critical of your work, and if you have, keep how you felt in mind. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.4">Was that person able to deliver the criticism constructively and kindly? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.5">Hopefully yes because that’s </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">the goal.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1">There is, unfortunately, a common attitude amongst many technical people that says being blunt is preferred and if someone takes offense they need to just toughen up. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">I, for one, very much disagree with this. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.3">Being </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">honest</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1"> is, of course, supremely important. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.2">But being honest doesn’t mean being harsh, or at least </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">it shouldn’t.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">Take care with the words you choose. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">Rather than saying “This class structure doesn’t make sense”, you might say something like “Ah, I see what you’re doing here, and why you chose to do things this way, but I wonder, have you considered doing X instead?” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.3">That expresses your concern with their work while not being as hard-edged. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.4">Of course, it should be obvious that you should never say something such as “This class structure is stupid”, but most people get that much right. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.5">It’s the more subtly harsh language that is trickier to pick out and avoid, but staying in the moment and concentrating on what you’re saying and how is the way to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1">accomplish that.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">You may sometimes get it wrong. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.2">If that happens, don’t hesitate to apologize, whether immediately or</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1029"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1"> later if it takes you some time to realize your mistake, which is something else </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">to discuss.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-284"><a id="_idTextAnchor284"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1">Taking responsibility</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">Almost nothing</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1030"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1"> frustrates me more than when I see a member of my team not taking responsibility for their actions, especially their mistakes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">That’s just not professional in my eyes and might even be considered a sign of immaturity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.3">No one enjoys admitting they made a mistake, but that’s what responsible, adult </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">professionals do.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">When you do inevitably make mistakes—and believe me, we </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">all</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1"> make them—you should own them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">Stand up, say “Yes, I made this mistake”, and then formulate a plan to correct the mistake. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.3">This plays into the need for people to rely on you. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.4">Relying on people who make mistakes and own them is easy, but relying on people who shirk responsibility </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">is impossible.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">Here, too, is another place where there is a fine line you must walk. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">There are obviously times when you get things wrong due to circumstances you couldn’t anticipate or even the actions of others, and expressing those things is a valid thing to do, but it can be seen as trying to side-step responsibility. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.3">The best advice I can give here is that it’s okay to say “Yes, I got X wrong, but it’s because of factors Y and Z” as long as you follow that with “but it doesn’t matter because here’s what I’m going to do to correct the situation”. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.4">That tells people that yes, maybe you didn’t perform perfectly, but there were external factors. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.5">And regardless, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">you</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1"> are going to take the responsibility for fixing the situation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.2">That demonstrates that you don’t put yourself above the team and can be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">counted on.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">Another thing that makes people enjoy working with you is not waiting around for things to happen but instead making them happen yourself by </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">being proactive.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-285"><a id="_idTextAnchor285"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">Being proactive</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">My wife, a</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1031"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1"> professional chef, has a saying: “If you have time to stand around, then you have time to clean.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.2">That works well in a kitchen, where keeping a clean environment is a big concern (a health concern for all, in fact!), but with a little tweaking, it works just as well in a web </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">development context!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">Basically, what it means in that context is that you can either be the type of person who sits around waiting for someone to tell you what to do and what to build or you can be proactive and look for opportunities yourself and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">dive in.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">Maybe you can spend some time cleaning up your CI/CD configuration files. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.2">Or perhaps you could write up some documentation about the configuration parameters that an application you support has. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.3">Or you might look at some code that isn’t written very well and </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">refactor</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1"> it, where</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1032"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1"> refactor means to rewrite it so it’s better (cleaner, simpler, more robust) without changing its functionality. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.2">You might look at optimizing the images used on your website to improve loading speed or you might implement an administrative function to be able to record errors that </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">occur better.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">The point isn’t specifically what you do, it’s simply the idea that you should look around, see what needs to get done, and then do it, or at the least, </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">offer</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1"> to do it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.2">It may not always be the best idea to just go off and do a bunch of work on your own, but you can certainly raise your hand and say “Hey, it looks like we should do X and I have some free time right now, so can I go do it?”. Get buy-in from your senior people to be safe, but you’ll find most people are very receptive to such requests (or else they’ll redirect you to higher-priority work, which is just </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">as good).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">Most people appreciate people who don’t simply wait for things to happen and to be told what to do because it removes load from them, both in terms of getting things done and also in terms of them having to figure out what you should work on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.2">To be sure, you </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">will</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1"> have idle time sometimes, and obviously, in most situations, you’ll have someone directing your work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.2">But, as the saying goes, idle hands are the devil’s playground. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.3">So, always be looking for ways to fend off that horned critter and make yourself useful and productive to the team when time allows. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.4">It’s a sure way to engender positive feelings </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.101.1">toward you.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.102.1">Of course, hardly any of this matters without one last </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.103.1">consideration: honesty.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-286"><a id="_idTextAnchor286"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.104.1">Being honest, always</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.105.1">Earlier, I mentioned</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1033"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.1"> criticism and how some people are very blunt and direct when giving it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.2">I spoke about how this can be detrimental to team cohesiveness because it can rub people the wrong way. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.3">But at the core of the harshness is a good principle: honesty. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.106.4">While it’s true that being overly blunt can land you in a situation where you start being unkind, honesty is a quality that should in general be valued at </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.107.1">all times.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.1">Of course, you should never under any circumstances outright lie; that much I would hope is obvious! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.2">You may think you’re protecting yourself with a lie, but all you’re really doing is ensuring that you’ll never be trusted if found out. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.108.3">You’re also not giving your teammates the information they need to address a situation properly, which tends to have a snowball-rolling-downhill effect: the problem becomes worse </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.109.1">with time.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.110.1">Also remember, as the famous Captain Jean-Luc Picard of </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.111.1">Star Trek: The Next Generation</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.1"> said: “A lie of omission is still a lie.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.2">There will be times when you have to deliver bad news to higher-ups, and you may be reluctant to do so because you know that, unfortunately, sometimes the messenger gets shot, as the saying (sort of!) goes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.3">Still, being a responsible team player means delivering that news so that decision-makers have all the information they need to make decisions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.4">But again, learning to soften the blow can be very helpful. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.5">Telling a manager that a project is at risk of failure may be accurate, but it also may not be appreciated. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.6">Instead, you might say that while there are some delays, and the level of risk to the project has risen, steps are being taken to address that risk. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.112.7">As long as that statement is true, that may come across a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.113.1">bit better.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.1">But there may also be situations where the blow can’t really be softened because the reality of the situation doesn’t allow it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.2">For example, you may simply have to tell the manager that there’s no way the project can be accomplished on time and there’s nothing that can be done to avoid that. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.3">This certainly isn’t an easy thing to tell someone in charge, but another aspect of being a team player and taking responsibility is “speaking truth to power”, as the saying goes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.114.4">You just have to step into the breach, deliver the news, and perhaps take your lumps </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.115.1">for it.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.1">Even still, take care with how you word the news. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.2">It’s probably not going to help anyone if you just blurt out “This project is doomed!” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.3">even if it might be true. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.116.4">Instead, maybe say something like “Given our current timeline and resource levels, I can’t see a way we can bring this project to a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.117.1">successful completion”.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-287"><a id="_idTextAnchor287"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.118.1">Being social without being TOO social</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.119.1">The modern </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1034"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.1">world is almost defined by social media. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.2">From X (formerly Twitter) to Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and many others, nowadays people are far more open about their lives than ever before. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.120.3">This can be a wonderful thing: we get to be exposed to other perspectives and other life experiences, and, of course, we can very often </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.121.1">be entertained!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.1">But social media can also aid you in your job search and your career evolution. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.122.2">Sites such as LinkedIn can be a great help in finding jobs and building your network, as discussed in </span><a href="B18315_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor219"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.123.1">Chapter 9</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.2">But whether it’s LinkedIn, Snapchat, or another platform, you must take care with what you share because, as they say, the internet never forgets. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.124.3">What you put out there can be found by just about anyone, and if it’s not flattering it can have negative consequences for your job prospects as well as your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.125.1">career growth.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.1">There aren’t any solid rules here because it’s tough to know for sure what might be a problem for any other person. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.2">The best advice I think is to simply be careful and before you post anything at all, ask yourself: will this portray me in a positive light? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.3">Is this something I would ever want to have to explain to an employer? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.4">To be clear, not all companies look at your social media. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.126.5">But these days, you can never be sure who will, so it’s better to play </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.127.1">it safe.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.1">Putting that aside, social media can also benefit you. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.2">For example, if you’re constantly interacting with other developers, even famous ones sometimes, you have the opportunity to learn and also possibly get a foot in the door. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.3">A positive interaction with someone can come back to aid you later when you’re hunting for a job. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.128.4">An honest, open, and productive debate about a specific technology could get </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.129.1">you noticed.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.1">For some context, many, many years ago, I was approached to write my first book primarily because of conversations I had on social media. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.2">A publisher took notice of the way I was able to present myself, did some research on me, found my personal site with some articles I wrote, and thought I might make a good author. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.130.3">It wasn’t anything I pursued or honestly even considered, but you never know when a good social interaction might lead down an </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.131.1">unexpected path.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.1">Finally, remember that unless explicitly authorized, you are not speaking for your employer online. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.2">Take care in what you reveal about your work situation in discussions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.3">It’s perfectly acceptable, for example, to debate someone about a given technology position online, and even to use your work experience in general terms, but it’s usually not a great idea to be overly critical of your employer online. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.4">Revealing too much specific information about how your company does things may not only be frowned upon but could conceivably turn into a legal issue. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.5">Your opinions are your own, and you have every right to express them, but where that opinion intersects with your work life is an area you have to be careful about. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.6">In general, the less said that can be tied to your employer explicitly, the better. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.132.7">If you </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.133.1">have</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.134.1"> to involve something from work in a public discussion, generalize it as much as possible to get your point across without revealing anything your employer may not appreciate </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.135.1">being revealed.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.1">The bottom line is to view social media as something that can be beneficial to you, but also as something you should be careful with. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.2">As with most things, striving for a balance between not being involved at all and over-sharing your entire life is probably a good general guideline. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.136.3">And remember that what you put out there could be seen by anyone at any time, so if you aren’t using social media properly then you might find your relationship with your team unexpectedly </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.137.1">impacted negatively.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.138.1">Another part </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1035"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.1">of fitting in with a team involves continuing to grow your technical skills. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.139.2">Especially in this field, which changes rapidly, you’ll have no real choice but to learn continuously, so let’s discuss </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.140.1">that now.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-288"><a id="_idTextAnchor288"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.141.1">Learning never stops</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.142.1">All the way </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1036"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.143.1">back in </span><a href="B18315_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.144.1">Chapter 1</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.1">, I mentioned that “learning to learn” is a key requirement of this field. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.2">However, it’s not enough in most cases to count solely on your actual working hours to be sufficient. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.145.3">The simple fact is that the pace of change in software development, including web development, is such that if you take a step off the train even for a little while, you can fall behind in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.146.1">a hurry.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.1">Back when I started, websites were simple things. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.2">It was just plain old HTML, CSS, and JS. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.3">You could very easily view the source of any website and see how things were done. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.4">There wasn’t any real sort of tooling to learn, you just popped open Notepad or whatever text editor you had on hand and started hacking. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.147.5">That was in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.148.1">early-to-mid 90s.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.1">It didn’t take long before libraries like jQuery hit the scene, and then you had to learn those. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.2">Frameworks started to pop up, names such as Struts and </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1">JavaServer Faces</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1">JSF</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.2">Though</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1037"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1"> those were Java-specific and not frontend libraries, they changed the way you developed applications in both relatively small and very large ways. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.2">Again, keeping up was </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">a challenge.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">At some point, probably around 2010, I’d say, there began to be an explosion of new frameworks, toolkits, libraries, developer tools, and all new ways to write both frontend and backend code (though the frontend has probably seen much more change overall). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.2">At some point, it </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1038"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">became virtually impossible to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1">know everything.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">But you still have to kind of try and do exactly that: </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1">know everything!</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-289"><a id="_idTextAnchor289"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">Specializing versus generalizing</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1">Naturally, you won’t </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1039"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1">ever know everything. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.2">If you spend time learning React, then you might not know Angular very well (though they overlap a fair bit in terms of concepts, so knowing one at least gives you a leg-up on the other). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.3">If you focus on Node for your backend code, then you may not know Java as well. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.4">It’s always a trade-off because, unlike Doctor Strange in the Marvel cinematic universe, you probably don’t have the Eye of Agamotto to effectively give yourself infinite time </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">to learn!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1">Some developers are specialists. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.2">They will focus on one or two key technologies or technology areas (frontend versus backend is a common demarcation) and not know too much beyond that. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.3">That’s perfectly fine if you find yourself drawn to a given set of technologies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.4">As long as they are in demand then you’ll probably be able to find gainful employment with that </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.1">limited scope.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">Even if you do specialize, it’s still extremely helpful, even expected, that you’ll have </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1">some</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1"> knowledge beyond your specialty. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.2">So, while you can focus on a few things, you still need to put some time into learning beyond those things, if for no other reason than to provide context for your specialties. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.3">That means you must figure out how to learn </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">new things.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1">Other developers though—myself included—take a different tact and prefer to be generalists. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.2">We shoot for breath of depth, knowing a reasonable amount about many things, but not necessarily being an expert in any (in reality, we usually tend to have a few “favorites” that we are experts in, but even the skills we’re experts in might shift a bit over time as we use them more or less). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.3">This tends to be a better path in terms of employment simply because you won’t be artificially limiting which jobs you can apply to based on your skill set. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.4">Not only is it generally better for employment, but it also tends to be more enjoyable as long as you’re someone who appreciates the challenge and enjoys a broader mixture </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">of tasks.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1">So, two things to keep in mind whether you see yourself as a generalist or a specialist are </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.1">the following:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1">Learn enough about as much as possible to at least have context around as many topics as possible, but perhaps focus on a few if you want to be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.1">a specialist</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.1">Figure out how you learn best and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.1">most efficiently</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.1">That last point is important because we don’t all learn the same way or to the same level of efficiency </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1040"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.1">for a given approach to learning. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.2">You have to figure out what your personal learning </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.1">style is.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-290"><a id="_idTextAnchor290"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.1">Determining your learning style</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.1">So, which way of learning </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1041"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.1">works best and most efficiently for you? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.2">Is it as simple as reading technical news sites? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.3">Or maybe blog posts? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.4">What about self-directed learning sites? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.5">Do you need videos or is reading sufficient? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.6">Do you need hands-on experience or do you just “soak it all up like a sponge” just by </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.1">seeing something?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.1">For me, I’ve learned that reading works much better for me than watching videos, for example, and then immediately experimenting with what I learned. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.2">I think that’s probably because I’m more in control of the pace when I read, but I’m not sure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.3">The reason doesn’t matter so much, just the understanding of what (usually) works best for me does, but I had to figure that out </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.1">over time.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.1">While there are no easy, simple ways to figure out your learning style, there are some general pointers I can provide that </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">should help:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.1">Experiment with different methods</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">: This is fairly obvious, but sometimes people think they already know their learning style and miss out on ones that actually work better for them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.2">Give various learning formats a try. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.3">Read books or articles, watch tutorial videos on YouTube, attend workshops or classes, or simply do practical side projects, and then take note of how you feel during each method and the degree to which you retain the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">knowledge afterward.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">Self-reflection</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">: After trying each method, reflect on a few key aspects. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.2">First, were you engaged the entire time or did your mind wander? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.3">Clearly, being able to remain engaged is necessary for proper learning. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.4">Next is retention. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.5">When you think back on what you (supposedly) learned, how much of it can you recall? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.6">The more, the better (though keep in mind that few people retain every detail, so be kind to yourself when you evaluate this). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.7">Were you able to take the knowledge and apply it practically by, perhaps, writing a small app with the new knowledge? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.8">The information we gain tends to not solidify in our brains until we use it, so this is a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1">key question.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.1">Feedback analysis</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.1">: If possible, get feedback on your progress as you learn with any given method. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.2">For example, if you’re learning by attending an online training course, see if there are assessments or quizzes to gauge your understanding as you go through it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.3">If you’re actually learning, then you should generally be able to do well on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1">such quizzes.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">Comfort vs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.2">challenge</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">: Identify if you prefer learning in a comfortable or challenging</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1042"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1"> environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.2">Some people do much better in more relaxed, self-paced, solitary settings. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.3">But others need the structure and interaction of a classroom, for example, to be led through the work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.4">Neither is inherently better than the other, it’s whatever works best </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.1">for you.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.1">Learn by doing</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.1">: Building stuff is kind of a key requirement in the web development field. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.2">Failing to do so will—unless you’re a truly exceptional learner—be required. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.3">As you learn and then build stuff, be it something real on the job or just a personal project, focus on how much you learn by doing versus just consuming information and then tailor your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.1">time accordingly.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.1">Community learning</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.1">: Not only are some people more comfortable in group settings but they also learn much better that way, the back-and-forth with others being of great aid to them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.2">Seek out places where you can learn collaboratively, be that classrooms, online chat rooms, or discussion forums, and see if this sort of interaction boosts </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.1">your learning.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.1">Varying complexity</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.1">: See how your mind does with simple versus complex tasks and topics. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.2">Some people do better learning more straightforward topics one way, maybe by reading tutorials, but for more complex topics, they require hands-on experience for it to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.1">sink in.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.1">Consistency and adaptability</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.1">: Track how consistent you are with each method over time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.2">You might start well with video tutorials but find that your interest wanes faster than with reading and you’ll need to adjust as you </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.1">discover this.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.1">Time management</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.1">: Of course, none of this matters much if you can’t find the time for learning, so it’s worth considering how each learning style fits into your schedule. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.2">Uninterrupted learning in any form is almost always better than constant interruptions, so ensuring you can carve out enough uninterrupted time </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.1">is critical.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.1">Feedback loop</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.1">: After choosing a method, revisit your choice periodically, don’t assume what once worked best for you still does. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.2">Also note that learning styles can evolve, and what works today might not be as effective tomorrow. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.3">I mentioned earlier that I learn best when I can read something, which I do alone, but there was a time when I thought I did better in a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.1">classroom setting.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.1">Keep in mind too that</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1043"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.1"> it’s not uncommon to have a combination of learning style preferences rather than a single one that’s always best. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.2">You can certainly blend various styles to create a personalized learning strategy that keeps you both engaged and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.1">learning effectively.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.1">I’ve mentioned putting knowledge to use in a practical way a few times, and I want to expand on that a bit into the concept of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.1">personal projects.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-291"><a id="_idTextAnchor291"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.1">Building personal projects</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.1">One thing I always</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1044"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.1"> strongly encourage, regardless of whether you want to be a specialist or a generalist and regardless of your preferred learning style, is to spend some personal time focusing and experimenting on a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.1">pet project.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.1">It doesn’t matter </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.1">what</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.1"> you build, so long as you build </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.1">something</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.2">However, when you choose a project, one definite requirement is that it is something that will hold your interest. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.3">For me, writing an app that calculates fuel compression ratios for cars wouldn’t hold my interest because I’ve never been a car guy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.4">But one that catalogs my vintage video game collection would absolutely hold my interest from start to finish! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.5">Anything that will be a bit of a challenge without being a huge time sink because, after all, this is your personal time we’re talking about, and you should always treat that </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.1">as precious.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.1">As well as choosing a project that you’re interested in, you need to choose something that is the right combination of difficult enough to be challenging but not so difficult that it will become frustrating. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.2">This, of course, can be tricky to figure out, especially early on when you don’t have a lot of experience to know when something with be difficult </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.1">or not.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.1">Given that, I’m going</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1045"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.1"> to suggest one type of project that I always suggest and that I almost consider a magic bullet-type </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.1">of project!</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.1">A magic type of personal project: games!</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.1">One unusual type o</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1046"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.1">f project I almost recommend to people is to write games. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.2">That sounds weird when most of us probably aren’t going to be professional game developers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.3">But the reason is that having written so many myself, I understand what such a project brings to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.1">the table.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.1">Writing a game requires you to touch on a great many topics in computer science, including algorithms, networking (depending on the type of game), AI, data structures, optimization, debugging, and so much more. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.2">When you make a game, regardless of the technology involved, you confront a lot of the same sort of problems you’ll confront on the job building any other software, website, or </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.1">web app.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.1">Games can be written in any technology too, which makes them ideal for experimenting with something. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.2">I’ve written games in BASIC, C/C++, Java, Pascal, PHP, HTML/CSS/JS, React, and Vue. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.3">I even wrote a game in COBOL way back in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.248.1">high school!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.1">And perhaps the best thing about a game project is that games are, by design, fun! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.2">Therefore, shouldn’t they be fun to build too? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.3">Well, it turns out they are… or, at least, can be. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.249.4">As with any project, you must balance the challenge with not driving </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.250.1">yourself crazy.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.1">As a manager of mine once said, you don’t need to build the Taj Mahal right off the bat. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.2">This is true for a game project, or really any other kind of game. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.3">If you try to build World of Warcraft right away, you’re assuredly going to fail because that’s a highly complex game. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.4">But, if you first just build a game where all you do is walk around, well, that’s the foundation right there! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.251.5">You can then add enemies to fight, spells to cast, and whatever else your imagination dreams up, all on top of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.252.1">that foundation.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.253.1">Plus, a game project for the purpose of learning doesn’t need to be original, or even </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.254.1">good</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.1">! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.2">In fact, I often suggest to people to simply copy a game they like, preferably a simple one, or if they really like a complex one, then at least boil it down to its very basics to start. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.3">Go ahead and make a Frogger clone or Pac-Man rip-off that just uses squares and circles instead of real graphics. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.255.4">Even if it doesn’t look good, it can still be a fully functional game that you can learn from by building (of course, if you’re practicing your graphic design skills, then maybe you’ll want to spend some time on the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.256.1">graphics too).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.1">As you work on a game though, think about the concepts you’re implementing and how they can relate to your day job. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.257.2">If you know you need to learn React for your job, then use React to</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1047"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.1"> build a game. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.2">If you know that you need to use Redux with React for state management then do that in the game too even if it might not be your first choice. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.3">In a way, make a game of building the game! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.258.4">Use the tools, technologies, and techniques you’ll need on the job to build the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.259.1">game too.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.1">Even if no one ever sees your game either, that’s totally fine. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.2">It can absolutely just be for you. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.3">And you may never play it yourself even. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.260.4">But again, it doesn’t have to be good or even fun in the end if you learn from the experience, and I promise you will learn from these types of projects, without even realizing </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.261.1">it sometimes.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.262.1">But maybe you </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.1">will</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.1"> want to show someone. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.2">After all, you may rightly be proud of your work and what you learned from it and want to show it off. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.3">Interacting with other people is the realm </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1048"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.1">of communication, which is another one of those soft skills we’re concerned with in this chapter, so let’s talk about </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.1">that next.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-292"><a id="_idTextAnchor292"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.1">Moving beyond smoke signals with good communication skills</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.1">Working as part of</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1049"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.1"> a team naturally means being able to communicate effectively, whether that be in written form or in person and whether it’s a design meeting, a presentation, or any other situations where we need to express ideas to others. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.2">When done well, it fosters cohesiveness in the team, which translates to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.1">better performance.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.1">Some facets of good communication skills are relatively obvious. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.2">For example, keeping things professional in tone is something most people inherently understand. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.3">It’s perfectly acceptable to make jokes in a professional environment, but quoting material from the likes of Eddie Murphy, Andrew “Dice” Clay, Dave Chapelle, Richard Pryor, and Ricky Gervais will likely not be appropriate (even if you find </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.1">it funny).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.1">Others, however, are a little harder to catch. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.2">Here are some key points </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.1">to remember:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.1">Clarity and conciseness</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.1">: I’ll make an admission here: around the office, I’m known as the “long email” guy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.2">I like to give full, complete explanations with as few assumptions about what the person I’m talking to knows. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.3">As a general concept, this isn’t a bad approach. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.4">However, brevity is also something that isn’t a bad approach. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.5">Communication, written or otherwise, should be done as clearly and as concisely as possible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.6">People’s time is valuable, so you want to get to the point quickly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.7">However, you must take care not to take this too far or you risk leaving out information people need. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.8">This is a skill I’m still working </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.1">on myself!</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.1">Active listening</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.1">: When speaking directly to someone, engage with them and what they’re saying without immediately jumping to conclusions or responses. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.2">This isn’t always easy because humans are emotional creatures and those emotions oftentimes get the better of our thinking brains. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.3">But, doing so will show respect to the person you’re talking to as well as usually leading to a deeper understanding for both parties about the issues or ideas </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.1">being discussed.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.1">Empathy and understanding</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.1">: Always practice empathy and understanding when engaging with others in any form! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.2">A big part of this is respecting the perspectives of others. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.3">Especially in today’s diverse workplaces, you have to constantly be trying to recognize where others are coming from and work to find common ground in discussions and problem-solving. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.4">Another big part of this is when people ask “stupid” questions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.5">As the saying goes, the only stupid question is the one you don’t ask, and I agree with this wholeheartedly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.6">Never be ashamed to ask what you think might be a stupid question, and conversely, be kind to others who ask them of you. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.7">Try to help as best you can, without judgment, even if </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.1">of yourself!</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.1">Consistent and open communication</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.1">: Communication that is regular tends to be better because it fosters relationships between people. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.2">After all, communication is a skill like any other, so it requires practice to improve over time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.3">It also helps to avoid misunderstandings, or more precisely, it allows misunderstandings to happen when the stakes aren’t as high and can be corrected </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.1">more easily.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.1">Written communication skills</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.1">: Specifically regarding written communication methods, such as emails, reports, and documentation, by their nature, you have time to do them right, so take advantage of this! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.2">Read and re-read what you write several</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1050"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.1"> times. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.2">Use whatever proofing tools are available to you and work to make it as direct and informative as possible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.3">As novelists often say, don’t be afraid to kill your darlings. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.4">What that means is don’t be afraid to cut out words that aren’t bringing value as you re-read them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.5">Just because you took the time to write them doesn’t mean they need to be there in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.1">the end!</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.1">Non-verbal communication</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.292.1">: Always remember that not all communication is direct. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.292.2">Paying attention to body language and tone, both in yourself and others, can yield powerful insights. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.292.3">These can often convey more than words and are crucial in understanding the full context of a conversation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.292.4">For example, if you are describing your approach to a coding problem and the person you’re talking to folds their arms across their chest, that </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.293.1">might</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.294.1"> indicate that they are not receptive to what you’re saying. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.294.2">Body language is not an exact science though, so you can’t treat such a signal as an absolute, but given that cue, you might decide to alter your approach somewhat. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.294.3">There are entire books about body language that can provide tons of useful information. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.294.4">One top pick that you might consider is titled </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.295.1">The Definitive Book of Body Language</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.1"> by Barbara Pease and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.297.1">Allan Pease.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.1">Feedback (both giving and receiving)</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.1">: Constructive feedback is essential for growth and improvement, and that goes both ways. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.2">Being open to receiving it helps you improve yourself obviously, and giving it in a way that is constructive and not personal is a key communication skill. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.3">Always remember to criticize ideas and not people. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.4">For example, saying “I’m not sure this approach will yield positive results” is a little better than “I’m not sure you chose the right approach here” because the former highlights the approach while the latter emphasizes the idea that someone made </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.1">a mistake.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.1">Conflict resolution</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.302.1">: No matter how hard you try, you will of course encounter disagreements </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1051"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.1">with people sometimes, as well as people who just aren’t very pleasant to deal with. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.2">Handling such people with calmness and a focus on solutions rather than blame can maintain a positive work environment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.3">Taking the high road is a skill all on its own that needs to be practiced because, again, we’re emotional creatures, and our first instinct is often to react emotionally. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.4">You have to practice fighting that reaction and keeping things intellectual and polite even when the other participant </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.304.1">doesn’t reciprocate.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.305.1">Cultural sensitivity</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.1">: In a global work environment—which is exceptionally common in the IT field—being aware of and sensitive to cultural differences in communication styles is vital. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.2">Interesting, I ran into this while writing this book. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.3">Though I'm American, Packt is not a U.S based company, so on a few occasions, I said things in a way that wasn't quite clear to someone outside the U.S, or used pop culture references that didn't quite translate. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.4">You have to always check yourself with things such as this, because while not being understood is one thing, you can easily offend someone who may have different life views and values, and that's a much </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.1">bigger issue.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.308.1">Proper utilization of communication channels and technologies</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.1">: Use communication tools effectively, whether it’s email, messaging apps, or good old-fashioned telephones. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.2">Always choose the technology that is appropriate for your needs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.3">If you have a question that you don’t need an immediate answer to, then use email. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.4">If you do need an immediate answer but it’s not super-critical, a messaging app such as Microsoft Teams or Discord might be preferred. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.5">I think it’s reasonable to say that a lot of people these days prefer technologies other than talking on the phone a lot of the time, so reserve that for more critical situations (unless, of course, you know you’re calling someone who simply enjoys a little conversation, in which case it may be advantageous to engage that person to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.310.1">build rapport).</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.1">Tailor your message</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.312.1">: Always keep your audience in mind! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.312.2">The way you communicate with technical people is often not the same way you’d communicate with a senior leader. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.312.3">For one thing, they have different concerns. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.312.4">A senior leader probably just needs the broad strokes of a problem and what the consequences</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1052"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.313.1"> of it not being corrected are, whereas technical people will need more detail to come up with solutions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.313.2">And of course, if you’re writing a message to someone you have a more extensive personal relationship with, then you might be able to be a little less formal than someone else (but still within professional boundaries while on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.1">company time).</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.315.1">Continuous improvement</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.1">: Always look for ways to improve your communication skills. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.2">Take advantage of any sort of training your employer might offer, or just seek out YouTube videos from experts to get specific tips you can implement. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.3">No one is perfect—myself included, as I mentioned earlier—but the only constant for us all is the need to continuously evaluate and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.1">improve ourselves.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.318.1">One last thing I want to touch on is somewhat of a general thought that I’ve touched on a little bit already</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1053"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.319.1"> but that probably deserves a little more focus, and that’s the marketplace </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.1">of ideas.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-293"><a id="_idTextAnchor293"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.1">Shopping in the marketplace of ideas</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.322.1">The </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.1">marketplace of ideas</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.324.1"> is a </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1054"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.1">metaphor that describes the need for open, public discourse about</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1055"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.1"> ideas. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.2">The goal is to determine the truth and value of different ideas, ideologies, and perspectives. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.3">We’re not talking about truth in the sense of a court of law; instead, it’s the notion that people will often have conflicting ideas and it’s our job to vet them openly and honestly, discard the ones deemed to be of no value, keep the ones deemed to have high value, or, as often winds up being the case, blend ideas into something new on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.327.1">the fly.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.1">The idea behind the marketplace of ideas demands that people be able to express themselves without fear of being ridiculed and that the ideas expressed will be debated and challenged without undue restrictions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.2">In the end, those ideas that the group deems to be the most “truthful”—where “truth” is defined as the idea that most of the group agrees with—will be seen as most beneficial and will prevail over others, and this is a very natural and productive way to accomplish both technical and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.1">non-technical tasks.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.330.1">To give a somewhat concrete example, let’s say you’re starting a new project and you’re trying to determine which frontend framework to use. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.330.2">You may be advocating for React, while someone else is advocating for Angular. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.330.3">You would state your position and explain why you feel React is the best choice. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.330.4">Perhaps you’ll make arguments about its user base being larger than Angular’s, that there are more developer resources available to support it, and that its comparative simplicity will make developing the project faster. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.330.5">The Angular advocate may debate those points, both in absolute terms and in relation to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.331.1">Angular itself.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.1">Part of the debate in the marketplace, so to speak, may involve both of you going off and creating a prototype to demonstrate your preferred approach. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.2">I was in a situation like that a long time ago, where I was advocating for an approach that used some then-new technologies including AJAX and a service-based architecture. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.3">These ideas weren’t common yet, but I saw the utility in them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.4">However, another architect at the time preferred a tool called Flex, a now-defunct product </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.333.1">of Adobe.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.334.1">We wrote up a document to describe our approach and our reasoning behind it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.334.2">We then spent a few days building a demonstrator app using our chosen technologies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.334.3">Eventually, we all got together—myself, the other architect, some other developers, and our manager—and we presented what we had. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.334.4">There was some debate in the room that day, but eventually, not to toot my own horn, my approach won out, and since then it’s been the standard way of developing apps both at my company and outside (and Flex went the way of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.335.1">the Dodo!).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.336.1">That situation demonstrates how the marketplace of ideas worked. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.336.2">Myself and the other architect were never arguing heatedly, we were never attacking each other. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.336.3">We certainly would point out the flaws in each other’s approaches and how our own had benefits over the other, but that’s the way it’s supposed to work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.336.4">Everyone got a chance to express their ideas and defend their point of view, but eventually, the marketplace decided which had </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.337.1">more value.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.1">None of this works without mutual respect, the ability to acknowledge that your own ideas aren’t the only ones, and the willingness to say that they might not even be the best. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.2">There isn’t any special skill to be learned here, it’s simply having a certain level of intellectual maturity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.3">No one typically enjoys being wrong or having their ideas deemed less worthy than others, but that’s the way the world works, and you must accept it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.4">The best advice I can offer is to try your best to keep emotion out of the proceedings. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.5">That, and try not to get emotionally attached to your ideas. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.6">As long as everyone is on a level playing field and comes at things the same way, then, as mentioned earlier, you’ll be “attacking” things and not people, which generally allows most people to keep their emotions </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.1">in check.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.1">The final topic I want to</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1056"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.1"> discuss in the realm of soft skills is a bit of a stretch, honestly, but I think it dovetails from the previous topics, certainly from communication skills. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.2">That topic is development methodologies, but primarily something </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.1">called Agile.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.360.1">In Waterfall, you’ll create documents such as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.1">the following:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.1">Business requirements document</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.364.1">BRD</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.365.1">): This is a document that outlines the business</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1062"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.366.1"> objectives of the project at a high level. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.366.2">This type of document is written in non-technical terms as it’s concerned with what the thing you’re building should do from a business perspective, what its scope is, and what the expected </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.367.1">benefits are.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.368.1">Functional requirements document</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.369.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.370.1">FRD</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.371.1">), sometimes </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1063"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.372.1">referred to as </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.373.1">system requirements specification</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.375.1">SRS</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.1">): This </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1064"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.377.1">type of document describes what the software will do in detail and typically includes things such as user stories and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.378.1">use cases.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.1">Technical requirements document</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.380.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.1">TRD</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.382.1">), sometimes </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1065"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.1">referred to as </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.1">software design document</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.1">SDD</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.387.1">): This is a </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1066"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.1">document that includes specified technical direction, things such as overall architecture, technology stack, database design, modules to be built, services interfaces to provide, and so forth. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.2">This is ultimately the document that a developer will base their </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.1">code on.</span></span></li>
<li><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.390.1">There are other types of documents without specific names (or at least acronyms), including user manuals to describe how to use the product; system administration manuals to explain how people who manage the system should do their tasks; project plans that describe the major milestones and tasks that need to be accomplished for the project to be completed, with estimates, dates and the people responsible for each task; and risk management plans that outlines potential risks and strategies for addressing them during the development of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.1">the project.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.1">These documents, and possibly others, are the output of Waterfall, and, most importantly, they are done upfront. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.2">No development begins until they are all written, reviewed, revised, and approved. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.3">If that takes a year, then no code is written (aside from perhaps some prototypes and design samples) for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.393.1">a year.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.1">At first blush, that seems logical, doesn’t it? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.2">People need to know what they’re building before they can start building it, right? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.3">And it makes sense that everyone involved should have a clear picture of the end goal and the steps involved in getting there, does </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.395.1">it not?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.1">But the problem is twofold. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.2">First, the time it takes to write all that documentation is “lost” in the sense that development typically doesn’t begin until it’s done. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.3">Obviously, that means no one can see anything until much later in the process, not even a partially-built system for a long</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1067"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.1"> time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.2">Second—and this </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1068"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.398.1">is perhaps the bigger issue—is that no matter how good your documentation process is, people often don’t know what they need! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.398.2">Or they sometimes realize things they didn’t specify correctly up front as the product is developed, as they see parts of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.1">it completed.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.1">Unfortunately, with Waterfall, it’s usually the case that the people who will be using the product don’t see anything until it’s done, or at least mostly done, at which point making changes, especially those that represent core changes to things underpinning the entire product, are very costly or even impossible sometimes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.2">If it takes a year to document everything and then another year to build it, no one is seeing if the documentation matches reality until close to two years later, at which point making changes may not be possible, so now you spent all that time, money, and effort and wound up with something that doesn’t meet the needs for one reason </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.401.1">or another.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.402.1">For these reasons, Waterfall has largely fallen out of favor. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.402.2">It isn’t gone entirely, some companies do still use it, and it can be beneficial in some cases where it’s easier to do up-front design because it allows you to better estimate a project’s timeline and makes things a bit more predictable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.402.3">However, it largely has given way to the Agile methodology for </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1069"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.403.1">most </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1070"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.1">projects, so let’s talk about </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.1">Agile now.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.407.1">Whereas Waterfall is </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1071"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.408.1">a sequential process (documentation and then development), the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.409.1">Agile</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.410.1"> methodology is iterative, incremental, and often parallel. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.410.2">Instead of designing everything at the start and spending a ton of time writing documentation, Agile favors building small pieces of a project and then iteratively updating them as needed to get them closer to what is needed over time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.410.3">Then, the next small part of the project can begin (or two small parts may be developed in parallel, depending on resource availability, but it’s an iterative, incremental process </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.411.1">either way).</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.412.1">The goals of Agile</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.413.1">The concept of Agile </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1072"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.414.1">began in 2001 with the Agile Manifesto, formulated by a group of software developers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.414.2">This document describes the key principles of Agile </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.415.1">software development.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.416.1">There are four core values described by the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.1">Agile Manifesto:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.1">Favor individuals and interactions over processes and tools</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.419.1">: Rather than adhering</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1073"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.420.1"> strictly to specific tools, the skills of people, teamwork, and communication are emphasized. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.420.2">This value puts focus on the importance of collaboration and a team-based approach—you know, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.421.1">soft skills!</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.1">Favor working software over comprehensive documentation</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.423.1">: This value puts the focus on delivering functional software rather than spending extensive time on documenting every detail, especially when done up front as with Waterfall. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.423.2">This doesn’t mean documentation is unnecessary. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.423.3">Instead, it means that producing working software is a higher priority and a better measure of progress </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.424.1">than documentation.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.425.1">Favor customer collaboration over contract negotiation</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.426.1">: Involving customers as active participants throughout the development process is the point of this value. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.426.2">It underscores the importance of customer feedback and adapting to their changing needs (or understanding) rather than relying solely on initial </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.427.1">contract terms.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.428.1">Favor responding to change over following a rock-solid plan</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.429.1">: This value explains how we should embrace change throughout the development process rather than rigidly sticking to a pre-defined plan. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.429.2">This means being flexible and adaptable</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1074"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.430.1"> to ensure the final product meets the evolving needs of customers and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.431.1">the market.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.432.1">Beyond the core</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1075"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.433.1"> values, there are also twelve principles described by the Agile Manifesto that elaborate on the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.434.1">core values:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.435.1">Customer satisfaction</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.436.1">: Customers</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1076"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.1"> who see continuous delivery of even small bits of functionality tend to be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.438.1">happier customers.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.439.1">Welcome changing requirements</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.440.1">: Rather than view changing requirements as a problem, Agile sees it as a plus, allowing customers to adapt to the market faster for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.1">competitive advantage.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.442.1">Deliver working software frequently</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.443.1">: The more often you can deliver working pieces of functionality, the better for the customer, who can put them to use even if the whole product isn’t </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.444.1">yet done.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.445.1">Close, daily cooperation between stakeholders and developers</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.446.1">: This allows for better decision-making and alignment of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.447.1">ever-changing goals.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.448.1">Build projects around motivated individuals</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.449.1">: When you give teams the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done, they tend to perform better and do so with more </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.450.1">personal fulfillment.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.451.1">The most efficient and effective method of conveying information</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.1">: Face-to-face interactions tend to be best, but in the modern virtualized world, teams can also work effectively remotely as long as they have good </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.453.1">communication skills.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.454.1">Working software as the primary measure of progress</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.455.1">: This one is self-explanatory and has been discussed already. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.455.2">After all, you can do everything else right, but if the product you deliver doesn’t actually work, then it hardly matters, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.456.1">does it?</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.457.1">Agile processes promote sustainable development</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.458.1">: The stakeholders, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely when properly using </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.459.1">Agile methodology.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.1">Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.461.1">: This helps to enhance agility by building on a solid technical foundation the whole </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.462.1">way through.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.463.1">Simplicity</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.464.1">: The art of maximizing the amount of work not done is essential! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.464.2">Code not developed is code that can’t have bugs, after all, so not over-engineering is a key technical goal, not just when doing Agile </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.465.1">but generally.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.466.1">The best architectures, requirements, and designs</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.467.1">: Self-organizing teams that guide themselves tend to produce </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.468.1">better artifacts.</span></span></li>
<li><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.469.1">At regular intervals, the team reflects on how it’s doing</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.470.1">: The team should periodically look at what they’ve done, how they’ve done it, and how things have </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1077"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.471.1">progressed and tweak the process as appropriate to support continued </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.472.1">process improvement.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.473.1">These values and</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1078"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.474.1"> principles, and Agile broadly, have had a profound effect on how software, including websites, is created. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.474.2">They have enhanced team dynamics and brought the stakeholders into the process the whole iterative </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.475.1">way through.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.476.1">That iteration I’ve mentioned a few times supports one of the main goals of Agile, which is to be adaptive to changes. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.476.2">This is accomplished by developing small units and pieces of the larger project and critically getting that in front of people as soon as possible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.476.3">That way, if the design wasn’t right, either because the business owners didn’t know exactly what they needed, the developer misunderstood a requirement, or whatever reason, only two weeks of effort was lost (and in most cases, it wasn’t completely lost). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.476.4">You can re-work the screen, iteratively, until it’s what is needed, all along adapting to any changes in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.477.1">requirements needed.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.478.1">This only works when there is continuous collaboration between people, which is why I justify this discussion of development methodologies, mainly Agile, as a “soft skill”. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.478.2">I acknowledge I’m stretching the definition a bit here, but I think I can get away with it because Agile doesn’t work if you aren’t working hand-in-hand with people! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.478.3">If you aren’t constantly communicating and having a back-and-forth exchange of ideas, then Agile falls apart, and doing those things are soft skills in my book </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.479.1">for sure.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.480.1">By the same token, customer feedback during the development process is a key component of making this work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.480.2">The way this is accomplished with Agile is in iterations called </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.481.1">sprints</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.482.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.482.2">I’ll get into </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1079"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.483.1">more detail about sprints in the next section, but in short for now, they are a period of time—let’s say two weeks—where a small increment of work is done. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.483.2">Maybe during a given sprint, you implement one or two features out of the fifty you ultimately need, for example. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.483.3">The goal is to have something that can be deployed and ideally used for real at the end of every sprint so that customers can get immediate benefit from what you’re building as you go, even if not the full benefit of the full project being completed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.483.4">They can then get hands-on experience and see where what was developed might not have been what they really needed, and that can feed back into the process and impact what you work on in the next sprint. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.483.5">Note that deploying after each sprint is definitely not a requirement of Agile, but the goal is that you </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.484.1">could</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.485.1"> deploy at the end of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.486.1">every sprint.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.487.1">One of the other </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1080"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.488.1">benefits of Agile is that testing is done throughout the process by necessity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.488.2">As a screen is built, it can be tested while another is being built. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.488.3">Unlike with Waterfall, where testing is almost entirely done at the end, you again don’t need to wait to find out things are wrong in Agile until the end as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.489.1">with Waterfall.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.490.1">Agile also shifts the focus—and to a large degree, control—onto the development team. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.490.2">It is typical for there to be a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.491.1">backlog</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.492.1"> of tickets; that is, a list of tasks to be accomplished. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.492.2">This backlog can be </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.493.1">groomed</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.494.1"> by the stakeholders, meaning it can be arranged in priority order (usually, the tickets at the top of the backlog have been deemed most important). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.494.2">Ultimately, the development team decides what gets done in each sprint, pulling tickets from the backlog</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1081"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.495.1"> during </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.496.1">sprint planning</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.497.1"> sessions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.497.2">There, they estimate each ticket and then decide how many tickets they believe can be done in the next sprint. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.497.3">Sometimes not all tickets will get done, and sometimes extra time will be available, at which point the next ticket from the backlog can be added to the sprint on the fly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.497.4">Sometimes, the order of the backlog might be ignored for various reasons (for example, if there is a ticket that the team knows will be easy to do further down on the backlog, but they want to pull it into the sprint just to fill it up </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.498.1">a bit).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.499.1">Note too that in all of this, documentation is de-emphasized. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.499.2">Oh, to be sure, there still is documentation in most cases, but it’s built on the fly, along with the code to a large extent. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.499.3">It also often lives in the tickets used for each piece built rather than being separate artifacts, though that depends on how a given organization implements Agile. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.499.4">And that’s a common thread here: there’s more than one way to do Agile, no truly canonical “right” way. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.499.5">Teams will tweak aspects of it to meet their needs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.499.6">In my projects, we tend to favor four-week sprints, for example. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.499.7">Some teams don’t do sprint review sessions (meetings after a sprint ends where you present your work to the stakeholders, discuss what went right and wrong during a sprint and what to do to improve the next one) while others do them religiously. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.499.8">It’s </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.500.1">all fungible.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.501.1">All of this combines to make Agile less predictable than Waterfall. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.501.2">You don’t usually know at the start how many sprints will be required, nor will you have a clear picture of what you’re building necessarily beyond some basics. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.501.3">If it sounds like chaos, it can be! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.501.4">But it’s controlled chaos, and it’s chaos that allows working code to get in front of people sooner, which </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1082"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.502.1">is probably the primary benefit </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.503.1">of Agile.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.504.1">The way Agile is implemented can vary from organization to organization, but most implementations tend to share a few key concepts, beginning </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.505.1">with sprints.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.506.1">Understanding core Agile concepts</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.507.1">As previously </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1083"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.1">mentioned, Agile uses the idea of sprints, which are small units of time—typically two weeks—where development is done. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.2">What usually happens is people design a small part of the application, perhaps a single screen out of many. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.508.3">This produces some degree of documentation as the designers and/or analysts write </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.509.1">just</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.510.1"> enough documentation about only the specific tasks in the sprint that technical people need to implement it but far less than is typical </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.511.1">with Waterfall.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.512.1">Usually, every day during a sprint, you have a </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.513.1">daily standup</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.514.1"> meeting. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.514.2">This, in some cases, is quite literal—the idea is to keep this meeting very short and sweet, and people tend to do that when they’re standing up. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.514.3">During it, each person goes around and quickly discusses what they worked on yesterday, what they plan to work on today, and if they have any blockers or issues that are keeping them from progressing (which the leader of the standup, the </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.515.1">scrum master</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.516.1">, will </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1084"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.517.1">try to help unblock by connecting them with the right person to address </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.518.1">the issue).</span></span></p>
<p class="callout-heading"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.519.1">Agile vs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.519.2">scrum</span></p>
<p class="callout"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.520.1">I dropped a term here that should be explained. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.520.2">Scrum is a specific form of Agile development, and it is probably the most predominant form, to the point where people tend to use the terms interchangeably. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.520.3">The main difference is that while Agile is a set of general philosophies and approaches to software development, Scrum refines Agile into specific roles (such as scrum master), specific ceremonies to perform (such as daily standups), and specific artifacts, such as the sprint backlog, which I’ll talk about shortly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.520.4">Other forms of Agile are sometimes used though, including extreme programming and lean software development. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.520.5">So, keep in mind that Agile isn’t the same thing as Scrum, but also keep in mind that in most cases, owing to its popularity, Agile and Scrum can be used interchangeably in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.521.1">polite conversation.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.522.1">But how do </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1085"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.1">people even know what they should work on? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.2">For that, a tracking system such as Jira (</span><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.524.1">https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.525.1">) is often used (see </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.526.1">Figure 11</span></em></span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.527.1">.1</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.2">For that screen, a ticket would be opened and the design details would be included. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.3">Then, the sprint begins, and a developer “picks up” that ticket to work on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.4">Over the next two weeks, they develop it, often going back and forth with the designer (sometimes a business analyst). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.5">But ultimately, at the end of that two-week sprint, the goal is that the screen—and that screen alone—should be in a deployable state. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.6">Ideally, it is entirely done and correct, but that’s kind of the goal: deploy it and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.529.1">find out!</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.551.1">Still, what you’ll often find is that the two methodologies, Waterfall and Agile, can be combined to some degree, leading to the best of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.1">both worlds.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-297"><a id="_idTextAnchor297"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.553.1">Hybridizing Waterfall and Agile</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.554.1">When you combine </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1090"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.555.1">Waterfall </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1091"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.556.1">and Agile, the goal is to accentuate the strengths of each while mitigating the weakness of the other. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.556.2">Since both approaches have their pluses and minuses, the idea is to wind up with as many pluses and as few minuses as possible, which can result in a methodology better than </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.557.1">either alone.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.558.1">In the hybrid methodology, there is some up-front design work and documentation—more than is typical in Agile alone—but once coding begins, it takes on a more Agile and iterative approach in that you work in sprints; you may release after each sprint and may adapt to changes more than you would with </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.559.1">Waterfall alone.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.560.1">Often, with a hybrid approach, there are set milestones that wouldn’t typically be present with Agile alone. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.560.2">For example, you may say up front that the goal is to do a release after six two-week sprints. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.560.3">That milestone is a concrete goal the team works toward rather than them just iterating until they feel the software is ready to be released completely or releasing it after </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.561.1">each sprint.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.562.1">While Agile favors minimal documentation and Waterfall emphasizes it, a hybrid approach seeks to strike a balance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.562.2">That means you may see some documents such as BRDs but maybe no TRDs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.562.3">The documentation deemed most essential might be built up front and in detail as with Waterfall, but everything else can be built minimally and kept </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.563.1">in tickets.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.564.1">Customer involvement is another difference. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.564.2">Instead of waiting until near the end of development to show the customers what you’ve built as with Waterfall, and rather than having them see every piece built as with Agile, you instead may only show them what you’ve built at predefined checkpoints. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.564.3">For example, if you have one hundred screens to build, you may group them into discrete pieces of functionality, where each group is maybe a dozen screens, and use each group as a checkpoint to show what </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.565.1">you’ve built.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.566.1">A hybrid approach</span><a id="_idIndexMarker1092"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.567.1"> can </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1093"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.568.1">also help manage risk better. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.568.2">Any development project involves some form of risk, be that loss of time or loss of money if the end product doesn’t meet the needs of the client. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.568.3">This risk is greater for Agile generally because, unlike Waterfall, there isn’t as much focus spent on specifying everything properly at the start. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.568.4">But, doing </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.569.1">some</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.570.1"> of that work upfront before beginning an Agile project can help cut down some of that risk since you’re more likely to catch fundamental problems at that point, the type of problems that tend to be more difficult and costly to fix later. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.570.2">For the same reason, the ability of Agile to respond to changes more efficiently means that there isn’t as much risk of discovering issues in the middle that put the entire project at risk as there can be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.571.1">with Waterfall.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.572.1">Using a hybrid approach still requires top-notch communication skills (see, those soft skills again!) and still allows for customization by the team. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.572.2">In fact, because it’s mixing two methodologies, it’s probably even more important to customize the methodology according to the team’s needs and desires, where the team means the development team plus stakeholders. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.572.3">Part of this customization too is ensuring that the methodology aligns with the culture of the organization. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.572.4">Some companies are inherently more flexible while others are more rigid, so it makes sense that you would have to tailor your hybrid approach to align with that overall </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.573.1">corporate mindset.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.574.1">At the end of the day, whether you use Waterfall, Agile, or a hybrid approach, communication and working closely with people is the key! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.574.2">Those soft skills will get </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.575.1">a lot</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.576.1"> of exercise with </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1094"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.577.1">Agile or </span><a id="_idIndexMarker1095"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.578.1">a hybrid methodology (less so with Waterfall, but really still plenty even there), so understanding that before you begin a project </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.579.1">is important.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.595.1">We also talked about how part of being a good web developer is continually learning, but not everyone learns best the same way, so you have to be introspective to determine your preferred learning style. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.595.2">We discussed how putting your learning to use in personal projects is, if not a must, then certainly a good idea, and how games especially are a great—albeit unexpected—type of project to accomplish </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.596.1">that with.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.597.1">We then looked at how to build effective communication skills; things such as how to compose emails concisely but honestly, how direct verbal contact has many layers to it including body language, and about the marketplace of ideas and how successfully navigating it with respect </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.598.1">is necessary.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.599.1">Finally, we looked at development methodologies, with a specific focus on Agile. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.599.2">You saw how this involves a whole lot of soft skills (especially communication skills), why it’s beneficial versus Waterfall, and how a hybrid approach is often </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.600.1">considered best.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.601.1">In the next—and final—chapter, we’ll, in a sense, expand on the topic of continued learning because I know it to be of particular importance in this field of work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.601.2">Hopefully, I can give you a bit more refined direction on how to ensure that your skills never grow stale and instead always remain current and, most </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.602.1">importantly, marketable!</span></span></p>
