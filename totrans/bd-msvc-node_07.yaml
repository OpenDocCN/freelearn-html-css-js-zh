    define the API endpoints that represent the services offered by each microservice.
    For example, a user microservice might have endpoints for retrieving user data
    using the `GET` method, creating a new user using the `POST` method, updating
    a user using the `PUT` or `PATCH` method, and deleting a user using the `DELETE`
    method. These HTTP methods are handled within a Node.js application using frameworks
    such as Express.js, which provide a straightforward way to define route handlers
    for each endpoint and HTTP method, allowing developers to easily implement the
    necessary functionality for each microservice.

    architectural style for designing networked applications. It emphasizes stateless
    communication, meaning each request from a client contains all the information
    the server needs to fulfill that request. In the context of microservices in Node.js,
    REST is commonly used to define the way services communicate with each other.
    When building microservices using Node.js, REST is often used to define the endpoints
    and the HTTP methods that the services can use to communicate with each other.
    For example, a microservice might expose a set of RESTful APIs that other microservices
    can call to perform specific actions.'

    that can be accessed or manipulated by the microservices. This can include defining
    how data is structured, how it can be retrieved or updated, and what actions can
    be performed on the data. In Node.js, developers commonly use frameworks such
    as Express.js to create RESTful APIs for their microservices. Express.js provides
    a simple and flexible way to define routes, handle requests, and interact with

  prefs: []

- en: In the context of microservices in Node.js, synchronous communication refers
    to a direct request-response mechanism, where the caller waits for the response
    from the target microservice before proceeding. This can be achieved through methods
    such as HTTP REST APIs, **remote procedure calls** (**RPCs**), or synchronous
    messaging systems, such as AMQP.
  prefs: []

    method of communication. This can be achieved through messaging systems such as
    Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ or through EDAs that use technologies such as WebSockets
    or MQTT. In this approach, the sender does not wait for an immediate response
    and instead continues with other tasks, receiving the response later.

    from affecting other areas. This can be achieved by creating separate pools of
    resources for different types of work, such as thread pools, database connections,
    and network connections. The idea is to compartmentalize the system so that errors

    or performance of other parts. This can help improve the system’s resilience and
