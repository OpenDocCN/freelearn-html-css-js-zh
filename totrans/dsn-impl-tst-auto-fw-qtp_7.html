In this chapter, we will focus on capturing the lessons learned and their utilization for future use, which will be covered in the following topics:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Preparing for the lessons to be learned</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Collecting and documenting the learning</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Best practices for collecting the lessons learned</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Discussing the lessons learned</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Storing and sharing the lessons learned document</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec41"/>Preparing for the lessons to be learned</h1></div></div></div><p>An organization that allows capturing of the lessons learned as a process becomes more efficient and effective in executing test <a id="id615" class="indexterm"/>automation projects from conception to completion. Ensure that the knowledge gained during the test automation life cycle should be captured in a way that it becomes effective for future references.</p><p>We will be organizing the lessons learned for the following areas:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">People</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Process</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Framework design</li></ul></div><p>Test managers and automation leads have responsibilities towards test automation, the automation team, as well as organizing and refining the processes. At each meeting, they should ask a series of questions regarding the following topics:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What has been achieved against the defined goals for test automation</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What are the best ways to utilize the lessons learned for next releases and future projects</li></ul></div><p>The discussion should be organized around the following three areas:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>People</strong>: What are<a id="id616" class="indexterm"/> the skills, knowledge, and experience we have gained about staffing and automation design; these will help in future releases and projects</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Process</strong>: The tools,<a id="id617" class="indexterm"/> techniques, or practices that were used for the automation and the ones should be used or avoided for future projects</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Design</strong>: How<a id="id618" class="indexterm"/> design<a id="id619" class="indexterm"/> and reusable libraries have helped in achieving goals and how to make them more useful for future releases and projects</li></ul></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec42"/>Collecting and documenting learning</h1></div></div></div><p>We have to collect and<a id="id620" class="indexterm"/> store information by its category; the key discussion areas for which<a id="id621" class="indexterm"/> we will capture the information are stated in the following sections:</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec70"/>Key challenges</h2></div></div></div><p>Every project has some challenges. <a id="id622" class="indexterm"/>Documenting these challenges and the methods of their mitigation will be of great help in future. These challenges can be related to people, tool technology, skills, or processes.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec71"/>What went well</h2></div></div></div><p>When positive outcomes <a id="id623" class="indexterm"/>are captured and documented, they become guidelines for future projects.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec72"/>What can be better</h2></div></div></div><p>When we capture what<a id="id624" class="indexterm"/> can be better, it suggests how proactively we can use these lessons to overcome the challenges already faced—these will help in risk identification and mitigation. Some of them can even be chosen as the goals for future projects.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec43"/>Best practices for collecting lessons learned</h1></div></div></div><p>Automation team members<a id="id625" class="indexterm"/> always possess the key to learning at the back of their minds; it is always in the best interests of the individual, project, and the organization. It is important to bring these lessons into writing by documenting them.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec73"/>Start capturing early</h2></div></div></div><p>We should start the capture learning early,<a id="id626" class="indexterm"/> right from the conception phase. This allows us to capture most of the learning without losing the information due to procrastination.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec74"/>Documentation and ensuring reusability</h2></div></div></div><p>It is important to<a id="id627" class="indexterm"/> document the lesson(s) even if not organized initially. Only <a id="id628" class="indexterm"/>capturing and documenting the lessons learned is not enough. You need to ensure that these lessons are saved and <a id="id629" class="indexterm"/>available for reuse; they should be easily accessible across various teams.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec44"/>Discussing lessons learned</h1></div></div></div><p>The lessons learned <a id="id630" class="indexterm"/>revolve around the following topics:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Agenda</strong>: Set <a id="id631" class="indexterm"/>up a meeting with the key stakeholders to discuss the lessons learned for the test automation. Begin with setting up the meeting agenda.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Project details</strong>: Here<a id="id632" class="indexterm"/> you will introduce the project and its details, such as the technologies and tools used, domain of application, and team size and composition. The details for the<a id="id633" class="indexterm"/> key stakeholders can be summed up as follows:<div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Customer</strong>: This field will hold the customer's name.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Engagement/Project Name</strong>: The corresponding project name is to be mentioned.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Test Manager</strong>: This field will hold the test manager's name.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Project Manager</strong>: The project manager's name is to be entered.</li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Challenges</strong>: Brief the team on the key challenges faced and how you mitigated them. <a id="id634" class="indexterm"/>Encourage every team member to participate and assertively speak about their observation and learning. Challenges can belong to any of these areas, including technical, process, people, and skill issues.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>What went well</strong>: You need to brief everyone on<a id="id635" class="indexterm"/> what went well. This will be useful for future references as best practices or reusable assets. These assets could be in the form of documentation or code libraries. The lessons learned will become the key reference points for later projects.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>What can be better</strong>: Mention the areas in which the team could have performed better; these<a id="id636" class="indexterm"/> lessons are very important for estimating the effort, risk mitigation, skill development and training, and improving all aspects of test automation<a id="id637" class="indexterm"/> for future projects.</li></ul></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec45"/>Storing and sharing lessons learned</h1></div></div></div><p>Mature organizations<a id="id638" class="indexterm"/> allow the storing of project documents and reusable <a id="id639" class="indexterm"/>assets and provide access to them for future projects. It is important to provide appropriate access to the documents with other teams across the organization. Some organizations have a <strong>Software Process Engineering Group</strong> (<strong>SPEG</strong>)<a id="id640" class="indexterm"/>. Some team members of the SPEG group review the documents and libraries before the artifacts are submitted to the central repository.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec46"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>Spreading knowledge and learning allows the growth of maturity for test automation individuals as well as for the organization. This chapter tells us about the practices and tips around the lessons learned and their importance, all of which are applicable for any test automation tool or practices, including QTP.</p></div></body></html>
