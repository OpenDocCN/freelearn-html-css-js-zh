<p>IoT devices can communicate in many ways, and some ways have become standards. We're going to explore a few of the ways IoT devices communicate, then dive into depth with one standard, MQTT. We'll then build a small project that allows us to see and send MQTT events with AdafruitIO, a service that provides MQTT brokers online.</p>
<p>The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>IoT device communications</li>
<li>MQTT – an IoT PubSub protocol</li>
<li>Setting up MQTT on the Pi with AdafruitIO</li>
<li>Project – adding an LCD and button to see and show MQTT events</li>
<li>Project – social media notification bot with IFTTT</li>
</ul>

<p>For this project, you'll need your LCD hooked up to your Pi (see <a href="17a3b756-743e-430d-a852-a78991b30012.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Getting the Information You Need</em>), a pushbutton, and a 10K ohm resistor for hardware.</p>
<p>For other tools, you'll want to create a free-plan account at <a href="https://adafruit.io">https://adafruit.io</a>. You will also want an account with IFTTT (also free) to do the final project.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">IoT device communications</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>As we saw in <a href="17a3b756-743e-430d-a852-a78991b30012.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Getting the Information You Need</em>, our Pi can ask for information from the internet using HTTP requests. But what if we want regular data sent to the Pi in real-time? What if we want a swarm of devices chatting with each other, data sent back and forth as necessary? Let's take a look at a few ways this can be accomplished with web technologies.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Long polling</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Long polling involves asking for information via HTTP requests at certain intervals. If this sounds familiar, it's because that's precisely what we did in our weather dashboard project in <a href="17a3b756-743e-430d-a852-a78991b30012.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Getting the information you need</em>; we poll the OpenWeather API every 60 seconds. This approach is best when there aren't other options; some REST APIs do not have a way to hold a connection open or establish two-way communication, and long polling is the way to go in these situations.</p>
<p>But there are newer ways of establishing two-way connections that can be left open, including the Websocket.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Websockets</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Websockets are a powerful tool that allows us to establish a two-way data connection that stays open until you close it (barring error or loss of connection). You can send messages back and forth in real time, without having to set up a whole new connection each time. It also allows the server to communicate back with your Pi without it having to ask, which is great for real-time data.</p>
<p>While websockets are powerful, there are ways to fine-tune this connection for IoT projects. It can also be difficult to maintain an open socket and keep the data you are sending or receiving organized. With this in mind, we're going to talk about MQTT.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">MQTT - an IoT PubSub protocol</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The <strong>Message Queuing Telemetry Transport</strong> (<strong>MQTT</strong>) protocol (often pronounced <strong>mosquitto</strong>) is a protocol designed for low-bandwidth, high-latency environments, which makes it a great fit for IoT projects, especially ones running on limited hardware. It is not solely used for communication between machines: some projects use it to send data for storage purposes.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at how MQTT works and how it implements a PubSub setup for our projects.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The basics of MQTT</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Let's go over a few terms, then link them together to define MQTT as a concept:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MQTT message</strong>: An MQTT message consists of a topic and a message. The topic is what clients subscribe to, and they usually read the messages for data.</li>
<li><strong>MQTT client</strong>: An MQTT client connects to an MQTT broker and can subscribe to and publish on topics once connected to the broker. </li>
<li><strong>MQTT broker</strong>: An MQTT broker handles client connection and passes messages along to all clients subscribed to a topic when a client publishes a message on that topic. It can also publish messages to topics, which go to all clients subscribed.</li>
</ul>
<p>In our project, we will set up our Pi as an MQTT client, connect it to a broker at AdafruitIO, and publish messages that the broker will send to the client (our Pi) and takes in messages it publishes. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Setting up MQTT on the Pi with AdafruitIO</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In order to set up MQTT, we'll need a broker. While the Pi can itself serve as a broker (see the <em>Further reading</em> section), we don't need broker functionality on the Pi. We can use AdafruitIO to create a broker that we can subscribe to topics with on our Pi. </p>
<p class="mce-root"/>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Creating an account and a feed</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>First, we'll go to <a href="https://io.adafruit.com/">https://io.adafruit.com/</a> and create a free account. Then, you'll be taken to a dashboard:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-605 image-border" src="img/75691a27-5240-495c-aa7b-2d76838c69d3.png" style="width:102.50em;height:42.50em;"/></p>
<p>We'll need to set up a feed and get our AIO key in order to get started on the Pi. To set up a feed, select Feeds in the left-hand menu. Then, click the Actions button in the upper left corner:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-606 image-border" src="img/72996438-7a9a-4008-a229-46376a708f70.png" style="width:82.50em;height:11.17em;"/></p>
<p>Next, select Create New Feed from the dropdown. Name your feed (I named mine <kbd>hands-on-robotics-with-js</kbd> to make it easy to remember what I created it for). Then, you'll be taken to your new feed's page:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-607 image-border" src="img/5469cf46-c90d-49ba-9c66-8e97305e9f53.png" style="width:99.92em;height:66.17em;"/></p>
<p>Now that we've created our feed, we can get all the information we need to get the Pi hooked up to it. First, let's get the Feed key to give to the MQTT module. Click Feed Information on the right-hand side and copy the value in MQTT by ID and place it somewhere it's easy to get to. Then, close the Feed Information window. </p>
<p>Next, click View AIO key in the left-hand menu. Copy the value in Active Key and place it somewhere it's easy to get to. </p>
<p>Now, to clear up some terminology before we proceed: the feed MQTT by ID name you took note of is going to be the topic of any messages our client (the Pi) sends to our broker (AdafruitIO), and vice versa. </p>
<p>We now have everything we need to connect our Pi to the AdafruitIO broker.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Subscribing to the feed using the mqtt npm module</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Create a <kbd>project</kbd> folder for this project to be transferred to the Pi. Inside the folder, run the following commands:</p>
<pre><strong>&gt; npm init -y</strong><br/><strong>&gt; npm i --save mqtt dotenv</strong></pre>
<p>This will install the <kbd>mqtt npm</kbd> module, which will simplify our MQTT connection, and the <kbd>dotenv</kbd> module, which will allow you to use environmental variables in a separate file (great for making sure you don't commit your AIO key to GitHub!)</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The mqtt module</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The <kbd>mqtt</kbd> module allows us to construct an MQTT client object:</p>
<pre>const client = mqtt.connect(url, {options})</pre>
<p>We will pass this method the AdafruitIO URL and our username and AIO key via the <kbd>options</kbd> object.</p>
<p>There are several event handlers available on the MQTT client object (see <em>Further reading</em>), but for this project we'll be using the following:</p>
<pre>client.on('connect', () =&gt; {})<br/>client.on('message', (topic, message) =&gt; {})</pre>
<p>Finally, we'll want to be able to publish messages from our client to the broker:</p>
<pre>client.publish(topic, message)</pre>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The dotenv module </h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The <kbd>dotenv</kbd> module makes configuration of environment variables that you don't want to, say, commit to GitHub, easy. You load it into your Node.js application:</p>
<pre>const dotenv = require('dotenv').config()</pre>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>This loads a <kbd>.env</kbd> file in the same directory that the Node.js file is in, which is in the following format:</p>
<pre>KEY=value</pre>
<p>And it is then accessible in your application via the <kbd>process.env</kbd> global variable:</p>
<pre>let key = process.env.KEY // 'value'</pre>
<p>Now that we know more about the libraries and services we're using, let's get a test connection program set up!</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Testing our connection</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>To test our connection, we'll get our Pi connected to the AdafruitIO broker, subscribe to our new feed, and publish a message. We'll know it works when we go to the feed dashboard on the AdafruitIO site and see that our message has been received.</p>
<p>To do this, we need to configure the <kbd>mqtt</kbd> client, set up a <kbd>connect</kbd> handler for the client, and use that handler to subscribe and publish our message. In a file called <kbd>mqtt-test.js</kbd> in the folder you set up earlier, write the following code:</p>
<pre>const dotenv = require('dotenv').config()<br/>const mqtt = require('mqtt')<br/><br/>const client = mqtt.connect(<br/>  process.env.ADAFRUIT_IO_URL,<br/>  {<br/>    username: process.env.ADAFRUIT_IO_USERNAME,<br/>    password: process.env.ADAFRUIT_IO_KEY,<br/>    port: process.env.ADAFRUIT_IO_PORT<br/>  }<br/>)<br/><br/>client.on('connect', () =&gt; {<br/>  console.log('Connected to AdafruitIO')<br/>  client.subscribe(process.env.ADAFRUIT_IO_FEED, () =&gt; {<br/>    client.publish(process.env.ADAFRUIT_IO_FEED, 'Hello from the Pi!')<br/>  })<br/>})</pre>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Then, in the same folder, create a file called <kbd>.env</kbd> (make sure it starts with the dot!), and place the following in it:</p>
<pre>ADAFRUIT_IO_URL=<br/>ADAFRUIT_IO_USERNAME=[the username you signed up for AdafruitIO with]<br/>ADAFRUIT_IO_KEY=[your AIO Key from earlier]<br/>ADAFRUIT_IO_PORT=<br/>ADAFRUIT_IO_FEED=[The feed info from earlier]</pre>
<p>Then, transfer the folder over to the Pi. In the Pi session, navigate to the folder and run the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>npm i</strong></pre>
<p>The preceding command will make sure that all modules are installed correctly on the Pi. Then, use the following:</p>
<pre><strong>node mqtt-test.js</strong></pre>
<p>Now go to your AdafruitIO feed dashboard. You should see a message there:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-608 image-border" src="img/496e8203-1d9d-4762-b422-ca9f8054183d.png" style="width:24.83em;height:4.58em;"/></p>
<p>Now that we know we can connect the Pi to AdafruitIO, let's add an LCD to see incoming messages, and a button to generate outgoing ones!</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Project – adding an LCD and button to see and send MQTT events</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>We can use the AdafruitIO dashboard to post messages to our MQTT feed, and so we'll use an LCD to show what we've sent. We'll also wire up a button that will send an MQTT message when pushed.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Wiring it all up</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>First, we'll wire our LCD to the I2C pins, and our button to GPIO #5, also known as P1-29:</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-511 image-border" src="img/0cb3759e-994f-44ad-8e74-eeb15cbd7cc6.png" style="width:39.25em;height:33.83em;"/></p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Coding it all together</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In a file in the same folder, create <kbd>mqtt-button-lcd.js</kbd>. Put in the usual Johnny-Five and Raspi-IO constructors, and in the board-ready handler:</p>
<p>Then, add the client constructor for AdafruitIO's MQTT connection from <kbd>mqtt-test.js</kbd>. We'll also set up our LCD and button objects here:</p>
<div><pre>let LCD = new five.LCD({<br/>  controller: "PCF8574",<br/>  rows: 2,<br/>  cols: 16<br/>})<br/>let button = new five.Button('P1-29')<br/></pre>
<p>After that, we're ready to code the sending of messages on the press of the button, and the printing of messages received on the LCD:</p>
</div>
<pre>client.on('connect', () =&gt; {<br/>  console.log('Connected to AdafruitIO')<br/>  client.subscribe(process.env.ADAFRUIT_IO_FEED, () =&gt; {<br/>    client.publish(process.env.ADAFRUIT_IO_FEED, 'Hello from the Pi!')<br/> <br/>    button.on('press', () =&gt; {<br/>      client.publish(process.env.ADAFRUIT_IO_FEED, 'Button pressed!')<br/>    })<br/><br/>    client.on('message', (topic, message) =&gt; {<br/>      LCD.clear().home().print(topic).setCursor(1,0).print(message)<br/>    })<br/>  })<br/>})</pre>
<p>Now, move the folder over to the Pi, go into your Pi session, navigate to the folder, run the following command: </p>
<pre><strong>npm i --save johnny-five raspi-io</strong></pre>
<p>Then, run the program (be sure to use <kbd>sudo</kbd> !)</p>
<pre><strong>sudo node mqtt-lcd-button.js</strong></pre>
<p>Now, press the button and you should see the message pop up in the AdafruitIO feed dashboard:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-610 image-border" src="img/b24077f9-5dbf-4019-827c-41c224c55d77.png" style="width:41.58em;height:15.17em;"/></p>
<p>And your LCD (remember, MQTT events are published to all, even the client that published them, if they are subscribed!):</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-611 image-border" src="img/209271d7-5979-4bd5-bd88-c161818bd608.png" style="width:14.08em;height:18.42em;"/></p>
<p>While we're there, click Actions, then Add Data, and type <kbd>Hello from Adafruit!</kbd> in the data box, and hit Create. It should show up on your LCD:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-612 image-border" src="img/08e39bd9-7283-486d-b75c-6586799f740f.png" style="width:16.08em;height:17.67em;"/></p>
<p>And there you have it! You now have a bot that communicates with the internet via MQTT!</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Project – social media notifier bot with IFTTT</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Having lots of tabs open in your browser, and clicking on each one to see notifications, can be a nuisance. Luckily, we can easily build a project that pulls in notifications from several sources to create a bot that notifies us on an LCD. We'll also learn more about If This, Then That (IFTTT), and its plugin that will allow us to route events to Adafruit IO and thereby our Pi.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting started with IFTTT</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>IFTTT is a way to create graphical formulas (called applets) that consist of a trigger (such as a social media event) and an action (such as sending data to AdafruitIO). We're going to walk through linking AdafruitIO and our social media accounts to IFTTT, and creating Applets to send social media notification data to AdafruitIO.</p>
<p>First, sign in or create an account at <a href="https://ifttt.com/">https://ifttt.com/</a>, and we'll start linking our accounts.</p>

<p>To link your AdafruitIO account, click your username in the upper-right corner, select Services, then select the All Services link at the bottom of the page. Then, type <kbd>Adafruit</kbd> into the search bar, and click the black box marked Adafruit, which should bring you here:</p>

<p>After that, click Connect and enter your AdafruitIO credentials. You'll want to do this for any social media networks that you'd like notifications from as well. I added <kbd>Twitter</kbd> and <kbd>Twitch.tv</kbd> accounts.</p>
<p>Now that we've linked our accounts, we should take a step back to Adafruit.IO and add feeds for our social media accounts so we can select them when we create our IFTTT applets.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Setting up feeds for your social media MQTT messages in AdafruitIO</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In your AdafruitIO dashboard, you should create a feed (this corresponds to an MQTT topic) for each social media service you want your bot to notify you on. Having clear and granular topics is important when building large MQTT systems with several bots listening for events.</p>
<p>I created a group for these feeds by selecting Actions on the Feeds page of the AdafruitIO dashboard and clicking Create a New Group:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-615 image-border" src="img/d7336c10-9f08-4404-8067-89e909aeb002.png" style="width:20.83em;height:21.50em;"/></p>
<p>I named mine as <kbd>Social-Media-Bot</kbd>. Once you've finished making the group, click the name of the group to be taken to that group's dashboard, which should have no feeds in it yet. Click Actions and select Create a New Feed from the dropdown. Then, enter the name of the social media service you will be using as the name of the feed. Repeat for any social media services you'd like to use.</p>
<p>The AdafruitIO Feed Group also serves as a handy namespacing tool. The twitter feed in the Social-Media-Bot group becomes Social-Media-Bot.twitter. This is extremely useful if you end up with multiple projects with Twitter data feeds.</p>
<p>Now that we have our social media accounts linked to IFTTT, and AdafruitIO feeds ready to receive data, let's create some IFTTT Applets to collect the social media notifications.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Creating our IFTTT Applets</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>On the IFTTT home page, you create a new applet by selecting your username in the top-right corner and selecting New Applet:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-616 image-border" src="img/246f08cf-cb15-4fd4-bf8e-f9247a1cc1b7.png" style="width:14.83em;height:12.92em;"/></p>
<p>You'll be presented with the IFTTT Applet formula:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/d7da2288-fc28-4124-b053-59a355cb41e8.png" style="width:20.08em;height:7.75em;"/></p>
<p>Click the +this link to be taken to a list of services you can use to trigger your IFTTT applet. Fill out the name of the social media service you wish to use in the search bar, and select it as it pops up.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/5aac1204-9409-4270-92b0-bb0c74cb7531.png" style="width:29.17em;height:24.42em;"/></p>
<p>You'll then see a list of possible triggers from that service. Select which one you'd like to be notified for (I started with someone following my twitter account). Once you click your trigger, you'll be taken back to the formula page, and the +this will be replaced with the logo for the social media site you use as a trigger. Then, it's time to create our action by clicking +that.</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/7d4c5a5d-842d-4a48-9143-c5ea117e4dd2.png" style="width:15.00em;height:3.00em;"/></p>
<p>You'll be taken to a similar page to select a service for your action. Search for <kbd>AdafruitIO</kbd> and select it. You'll be asked to fill out some information about which AdafruitIO feed you'd like to send to, and the message you'd like to send:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/87618227-2346-4c92-8a5f-6c45a0a091e6.png" style="width:30.08em;height:39.25em;"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Select the name of the feed that matches the social media site that triggers this applet. Under data to save, you can enter a message that we can display on the LCD. You can also click the Add ingredient button to add information from the social media event itself:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/fc4638c8-896a-4198-9ea9-cf51a78d186c.png" style="width:24.58em;height:21.08em;"/></p>
<p>I selected FullName and ended up with the message <kbd>{{FullName}} followed you on Twitter</kbd>!</p>
<p>Repeat this for both the other triggers from the first social media site and the other social media sites and their triggers.</p>
<p>Now that our IFTTT Applets are sending data to AdafruitIO, we can start wiring and coding our bot.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Wiring up our project</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>All you need for this project is the LCD; if you wired up the button for the last project, you can remove it:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/6a4ccdea-53cd-432d-b802-936f9d715a70.png" style="width:42.58em;height:37.50em;"/></p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Coding our social media notifications to show on the LCD</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="mce-root">Create a file named <kbd>social-media-bot.js</kbd> in your <kbd>project</kbd> folder, and copy the contents of <kbd>mqtt-button-lcd</kbd> into it. We're going to modify this file to create our social media bot.</p>
<p>First, remove all references to the button variable and <kbd>Button</kbd> object, since we won't be using them.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Next. we'll need to get the names of the feeds (topics) that we'll be subscribing to. To do this, click each feed in the AdafruitIO Feeds page that you want to use for this bot. Then in the right column of the page, click Feed Information and copy the MQTT by key field:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-515 image-border" src="img/91bd643c-0673-47a9-8da5-4b21a127cec9.png" style="width:34.83em;height:6.83em;"/></p>
<p>Then, in the <kbd>client.on('connect')</kbd> handler, we're going to subscribe to multiple topics, and not use the callback feature. Then, we'll add a <kbd>client.on('message')</kbd> handler to display the message from IFTTT on the LCD display:</p>
<pre>client.on('connect', () =&gt; {<br/>  console.log('Connected to AdafruitIO')<br/>  client.subscribe('nodebotanist/feeds/social-media-bot.twitter')<br/>  client.subscribe('nodebotanist/feeds/social-media-bot.twitch')<br/>  client.on('message', (topic, message) =&gt; {<br/>    LCD.clear()<br/>    LCD.home()<br/>    LCD.autoscroll()<br/>    LCD.print(message)<br/>  })<br/>})</pre>
<p>Now that we've subscribed to our new feeds and set it to print to the LCD, we can run it!</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Running your social media bot</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Run the following command to see the output:</p>
<pre><strong>sudo node social-media-bot.js</strong></pre>
<p>Soon, you should see a message pop up on your LCD when you get a social media notification.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this chapter, we discussed several ways that internet-connected devices can talk to each other. We dove into the MQTT protocol and discussed how its PubSub interface and abstractions made it a great choice for projects on our Pi. Then, we built a bot that communicated with the outside world using a button and let the outside world communicate with it via the AdafruitIO dashboard and IFTTT. Finally, we built a social media notification bot using AdafruitIO integration into IFTTT.</p>
