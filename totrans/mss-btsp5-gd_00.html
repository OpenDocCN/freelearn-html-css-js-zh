<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
<p>Bootstrap is one of the world’s most popular frontend UI toolkit and comes with easy-to-use and off-the-shelf solutions for building responsive websites with the use of components, utilities, JavaScript plugins, and more. You can customize Bootstrap 5 with Sass to achieve a unique-looking layout that stands out from the crowd. Learning how to customize Bootstrap 5 enables a developer to create something unique that doesn’t look like Bootstrap.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>The book is intended for UI designers and developers who are familiar with HTML and already have some experience with using Bootstrap version 4 or 5. This includes frontend as well as backend developers using Bootstrap who don’t know how to code CSS but know enough about HTML.</p>
<p>Experienced users of the default Bootstrap files can also benefit from this book by learning all about customization and other advanced features.</p>
<p>This book won't teach the basics of how to code a user interface with default Bootstrap 5 components. Instead, this book is about customization of Bootstrap 5 in various ways.</p>
