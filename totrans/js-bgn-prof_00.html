    <h1 id="_idParaDest-4" class="Introduction-Title--PACKT-">Preface</h1>&#13;
    <p class="normal">JavaScript is an amazing multi-functional language that is used a lot for web development (among other things). Any interaction that happens on web pages is JavaScript in action. In fact, all modern browsers understand JavaScript—and soon you will understand it too.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal">This book deals with everything you need to know to create JavaScript applications and use JavaScript on web pages. By the time you finish this book, you'll be capable of creating interactive web pages, dynamic applications, and a lot more as you progress on your professional JavaScript journey!</p>&#13;
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-5" class="title">Who this book is for</h1>&#13;
    <p class="normal">To get started with this book, you don't need any JavaScript experience. However, if you do have some coding experience, you're likely to go through the book and exercises with a bit more ease. Basic familiarity with HTML and CSS would be of benefit. If you're a first-time programmer, we are honored to welcome you to the world of programming in this book. It may seem difficult in the beginning, but we'll guide you right through it.</p>&#13;
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-6" class="title">What this book covers</h1>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 1</em>, <em class="italic">Getting Started with JavaScript</em>, covers some fundamentals of the JavaScript language that you'll have to know to understand the rest of the book.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 2</em>, <em class="italic">JavaScript Essentials</em>, deals with essentials such as variables, data types, and operators.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 3</em>, <em class="italic">JavaScript Multiple Values</em>, covers how to store multiple values in one variable using arrays and objects.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 4</em>, <em class="italic">Logic Statements</em>, is where the real fun starts: we are going to use logic statements to make decisions for us!</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 5</em>, <em class="italic">Loops</em>, accounts for situations when it is necessary to repeat a block of code, which is what we use loops for. We are using different types of loops, such as the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">for</code> and the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">while</code> loop.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="italic">Functions</em>, introduces a very useful block for repeating code snippets: functions! This enables us to invoke a specified code block at any time in our script to do something for us. This will help you to not repeat yourself, which is one of the fundamental principles of writing clean code.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 7</em>, <em class="italic">Classes</em>, continues with building blocks of JavaScript that help us to structure our application better. We have already seen how to create objects, and with classes we learn how to create a template for objects that we can reuse anytime we need that particular type of object.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 8</em>, <em class="italic">Built-In JavaScript Methods</em>, deals with some great built-in functionality. Functions are something we can write ourselves, but we'll find ourselves using the built-in JavaScript functions often whenever we need to do common tasks, such as checking whether something is a number or not.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 9</em>, <em class="italic">The Document Object Model</em>, dives into the browser object model and document object model (DOM). This is going to enrich the way we can use JavaScript by a lot. We'll learn what the DOM is, and how we can affect it with JavaScript and change our websites by doing so.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 10</em>, <em class="italic">Dynamic Element Manipulation Using the DOM</em>, demonstrates how to manipulate the elements of the DOM dynamically, which will enable you to create modern user experiences. We can change our website as a response to user behavior such as clicking on a button.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 11</em>, <em class="italic">Interactive Content and Event Listeners</em>, takes our responses to the user to the next level. For example, we are going to learn how to respond to events such as the cursor leaving an input box and the mouse of the user moving.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 12</em>, <em class="italic">Intermediate JavaScript</em>, deals with topics that you'll need to write intermediate JavaScript code, such as regular expressions, recursion, and debugging, to boost the performance of your code.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 13</em>, <em class="italic">Concurrency</em>, introduces the topic of concurrency and asynchronous programming, which will allow our code to do multiple things at the same time and be truly flexible.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 14</em>, <em class="italic">HTML5, Canvas, and JavaScript</em>, focuses on HTML5 and JavaScript. We'll have seen a lot of both HTML and JavaScript in the previous chapters, but here we'll be focusing on the HTML5-specific features, such as the canvas element.</p>&#13;
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 15</em>, <em class="italic">Next Steps</em>, explores the next steps you could take after you've gotten all the fundamental features of JavaScript down and you are able to write nifty programs using JavaScript. We'll take a look at some of the famous JavaScript libraries and development frameworks, such as Angular, React, and Vue, and we'll have a look at Node.js to see how the backend can be written in JavaScript.</p>&#13;
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-7" class="title">To get the most out of this book</h1>&#13;
    <p class="normal">Previous coding experience will help, but is definitely not required. If you have a computer with a text editor (such as Notepad or TextEdit, not Word!) and a browser, you can get started with this book. We encourage you to engage with the exercises and projects, and experiment continually while you go through the chapters, to ensure you are comfortable with each concept before moving on.</p>&#13;
