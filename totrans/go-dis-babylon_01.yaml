- en: 'One of the two main game phases, the Route Planning Simulation, is where players
    become content creators. Using a top-down map view, drivers plan their route before
    embarking on their journey. From an initial starting orbit close to the inner-most
    planet, players must balance how much launch force is used with aiming and timing
    to put the simulated cargo on a path to the destination planet. Once launched,
    the cargo is entirely at the mercy of gravity and Sir Isaac Newton. Pro tip: aim
    ahead of where you want to end up but be sure to account for the pull of the sun.
    Because it is a simulation of a route, there are no consequences for failure –
    the player is free to try as many times as they want to find the perfect route
    to drive in the next phase.'

  zh: 主要游戏阶段之一，路线规划模拟，是玩家成为内容创作者的地方。使用俯视图，驾驶员在出发前规划他们的路线。从初始的起始轨道，靠近最内层的行星，玩家必须平衡使用多少发射力与瞄准和时机，以便将模拟的货物放置在通往目标行星的路径上。一旦发射，货物完全受重力和大卫·牛顿爵士的控制。小贴士：瞄准你想要到达的地方之前，但一定要考虑到太阳的引力。因为这是一个路线模拟，失败没有后果——玩家可以自由尝试多次，以找到下一阶段驾驶的完美路线。

    wheel and guide their Space-Truck through the transit corridor while avoiding
    collision with the random events that have been recorded during the route planning
    phase. The player’s unit drifts in free-fall, so velocity accrued in any given
    direction will remain unless later canceled out by opposing acceleration. Collision
    results in damage, and with enough damage, the truck and its cargo are destroyed.

- en: On a brighter note, completing the course results in the player’s score being
    calculated. Several different factors contribute to the overall total final score.
    The length of the route, the time it took the simulation to complete the route
    versus the time the player took, and the initial launch velocity in route planning
    are all some of the factors involved in scoring. If a player’s score is high enough,
    then it will displace one of the previous high score holders to place the player’s
    selected initials into the hall of legends.

    knowledge into actionable skills. The key to maximizing learning is the proper

    each chapter involving the application code. In addition, each chapter may have
    one or more Playground snippets (see [*Chapter 2*](B17266_02_Final_AM.xhtml#_idTextAnchor030),
    *Ramping up on Babylon.js*, for more on the Playground) specific to the content
    covered in that chapter. Snippets are neat in a lot of ways and one of those is
    that they can have multiple revisions. Toggling between different revisions of
    a snippet is a great way to visually see how an example has evolved and can help
    bring insights as to why a particular piece of code behaves as it does.
