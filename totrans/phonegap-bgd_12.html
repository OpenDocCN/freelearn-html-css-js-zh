It means that you can reuse most of the code, but you still have to build the app for each target platform. You can do this by configuring the development environment for each platform you want to support or you can use online services <a id="id815" class="indexterm"/>such as PhoneGap Build services (<a class="ulink" href="http://build.phonegap.com">http://build.phonegap.com</a>) or Icenium (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.icenium.com/">http://www.icenium.com/</a>). Both are cloud-based services; the main<a id="id816" class="indexterm"/> difference is that the PhoneGap Build service supports all the platforms, whereas Icenium supports only the Android and iOS platforms but does come with a very nice online editor. Once the builds are ready, you have to follow a different workflow for each target platform.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note47"/>Note</h3><p>Also, if you are dealing with cross-platform development when using PhoneGap, it's always a good habit to use a testing device for each platform during the development phase and when preparing the build.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Publishing on Google Play"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec105"/>Publishing on Google Play</h1></div></div></div><p>

<div class="section" title="Publishing on Blackberry World"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec106"/>Publishing on Blackberry World</h1></div></div></div><a id="id824" class="indexterm"/><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>BlackBerry World</strong></span> (previously <span class="strong"><strong>BlackBerry App World</strong></span>) is an <a id="id825" class="indexterm"/>application distribution service and an application by BlackBerry that allows users to browse, download, and update third-party applications. In <a id="id826" class="indexterm"/>order to publish an app on the BlackBerry World market, you need to have a BlackBerry developer account (you can create this for free at <a class="ulink" href="https://developer.blackberry.com/">https://developer.blackberry.com/</a>). You also need to apply to become a vendor providing your BlackBerry ID information (a PayPal account is required to complete the application), which you can do at <a class="ulink" href="https://appworld.blackberry.com/isvportal/home.do">https://appworld.blackberry.com/isvportal/home.do</a>.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="graphics/B03476_Appendix_B_02.jpg" alt="Publishing on Blackberry World"/></div><p>After you submit your application as a vendor, you will receive a confirmation e-mail asking you to provide official documentation to validate your company information or a copy (front and back) of an official government-issued identification card in case you applied as an individual to the vendor portal.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note49"/>Note</h3><p>The verification process can take up to two days, so you have to consider it carefully when you are planning a release for a specific date.</p></div></div><p>When<a id="id827" class="indexterm"/> your <a id="id828" class="indexterm"/>account is confirmed, you can add an app (that is, a product) providing the name, description, logo, screenshots, and any other required details about your application. For details on the requirements, refer to the online information available at the<a id="id829" class="indexterm"/> BlackBerry World app store at <a class="ulink" href="https://developer.blackberry.com/devzone/blackberryworld/preparing_your_app_for_blackberry_world.html">https://developer.blackberry.com/devzone/blackberryworld/preparing_your_app_for_blackberry_world.html</a>.</p><p>The release of an app to the BlackBerry World also involves a signing process. This process assumes that you already have downloaded and installed the <a id="id830" class="indexterm"/>BlackBerry 10 WebWorks SDK available at <a class="ulink" href="https://developer.blackberry.com/html5/downloads/">https://developer.blackberry.com/html5/downloads/</a>. Before you can get your BlackBerry 10 app signed, you have to complete the web form at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.blackberry.com/SignedKeys">https://www.blackberry.com/SignedKeys</a>. When your application is accepted, you will receive two <code class="literal">.csj</code> registration files by e-mail. Each file arrives in a separate e-mail message with information about the purpose of the file attached (one is to generate a debug token and one to sign the app for the marketplace). In order to register with the RIM Signing Authority, you have to run the <code class="literal">.bar</code> file stored in the <code class="literal">\dependencies\tools\bin</code> folder located in the BlackBerry 10 WebWorks SDK installation folder from your command-line tool. This tool creates the following files needed to digitally sign the app: <code class="literal">author.p12</code>, <code class="literal">barsigner.csk</code>, and <code class="literal">barsigner.db</code>.</p><p>Be very careful about the app naming; an application name that starts with a brand/company/product implies an association and that it's an authorized or an official application. If you name your app YouTube Player, it will be rejected for sure (instead, name it Player for YouTube).</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Publishing on the Apple App Store"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec107"/>Publishing on the Apple App Store</h1></div></div></div><p>The<a id="id831" class="indexterm"/> Apple App Store<a id="id832" class="indexterm"/> is a digital application distribution platform for iOS apps maintained by Apple Inc. Users can browse through<a id="id833" class="indexterm"/> the App Store and install applications directly to an iOS device. Although Apple envisions the App Store to be a global product, in reality its market is restricted by national boundaries. In other words, there are potentially as many distinct App Stores as there are countries in the world. To publish an app through the Apple App Store, you need to have an <a id="id834" class="indexterm"/>Apple Developer account (<a class="ulink" href="http://developer.apple.com/programs/register">http://developer.apple.com/programs/register</a>) and be a member of the<a id="id835" class="indexterm"/> iOS Developer Program (<a class="ulink" href="http://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/">http://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/</a>; the cost is $99 per year). The first step is to register an app ID with the developer portal and then you have to create the development and distribution certificates.</p><p>Then, you<a id="id836" class="indexterm"/> need to set up a distribution <a id="id837" class="indexterm"/>certificate. To do this, you will first need to generate a certificate request from your computer and then upload it to the developer portal. On a Mac, you should do this by opening the Keychain Access application available in <span class="strong"><strong>Utilities</strong></span> and then go to <span class="strong"><strong>Keychain Access</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Certificate Assistant</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Request a Certificate from a Certificate Authority</strong></span>. Enter your e-mail address and name and select <span class="strong"><strong>Request is Saved to disk</strong></span> to save the <code class="literal">CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest</code> file on your desktop. Go to the developer portal, upload the certificate request, and complete the steps required to generate the distribution certificate.</p><p>When the certificate is ready, you can create a new distribution provisioning profile by selecting the app you want to submit and the certificate to use. Download the file and in Xcode, select <span class="strong"><strong>Window</strong></span> | <span class="strong"><strong>Organizer</strong></span>, click on <span class="strong"><strong>Devices</strong></span>, select <span class="strong"><strong>Provisioning Profiles</strong></span>, and drag the provisioning profile with the <code class="literal">.mobileprovision</code> extension to the Organizer. Next, open the build settings pane and set the code-signing identity; in this way, the app is then code signed when you create an archive and you can complete the publication procedure using Xcode. When submitting the app, you will also be required to provide a description, several screenshots, icons, and other information. For details, refer to the online documentation at <a class="ulink" href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html">https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html</a>.</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note50"/>Note</h3><p>The verification process varies depending on the number of submissions currently under review, but it typically takes more than two days. You can find the App Store's estimated review time at <a class="ulink" href="http://reviewtimes.shinydevelopment.com/">http://reviewtimes.shinydevelopment.com/</a>.</p></div></div><p>Presenting a simple version of your app as first release will help to speed up the approval process a little bit. It's the initial app approval process that takes the most time; once approved, future updates are far easier to get done. So keep the advanced features for later releases of your app.</p><p>Visit <a class="ulink" href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/8003/how-to-submit-your-app-to-apple-from-no-account-to-app-store-part-1">http://www.raywenderlich.com/8003/how-to-submit-your-app-to-apple-from-no-account-to-app-store-part-1</a> for a detailed tutorial on publishing an app to Apple App Store.</p></div>

<span class="strong"><strong>Windows Phone Store</strong></span> (previously <span class="strong"><strong>Windows Phone Marketplace</strong></span>) is a digital distribution platform <a id="id839" class="indexterm"/>that allows users to browse and install applications that have been developed by third parties. The <a id="id840" class="indexterm"/>UI is presented in a very "Metro UI" way using a panoramic view where the user can browse categories and titles, see featured items, and get details with ratings, reviews, screenshots, and pricing information.</p><p>To submit and manage apps on Windows Phone Dev Center, you first have to register and become a member using a Microsoft account (formerly known as Windows Live ID). When registering, you will be asked to pay an annual Developer Center subscription fee of $99 plus any applicable tax. In exchange, you'll get to submit unlimited paid apps to Windows Phone Store (you can also submit up to 100 free apps). The publishing process is simple and straightforward: you have to provide the app details (name, description, screenshots, and so on) and then submit the XAP file packaged with Visual Studio. You must package and prepare your app before you can upload it to the store; the packaging process starts when you create a Windows Store project or item based on a template (refer to the online documentation at <a class="ulink" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br230260.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br230260.aspx</a> for a complete overview of the packaging process).</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note51"/>Note</h3><p>The verification process is pretty fast, but you need a couple of days to complete the registration process if you are registering as a company.</p></div></div><p>In order to reduce the duration of the review, you can screen your app locally using the <span class="strong"><strong>Windows Application Certification Kit</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong>WACK</strong></span>) tool<a id="id841" class="indexterm"/> available in the Windows Phone SDK. It reduces the approval cycle by giving you a way to screen your app locally for issues before you even submit it to the Windows Store.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch10lvl1sec109"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this appendix, you learned how you can publish your app on different app stores and about common issues. It's pretty clear that the Apple store is the one that requires the most complex workflow, but it also attracts the most developers. You can easily manage publication on all the different markets by yourself or with the support offered by services such as the one by PhoneGap Build.</p></div></body></html>
