			<h1 id="_idParaDest-83"><a id="_idTextAnchor082"/>Learning to Work with Geometries</h1>
			<p>In the previous chapters, you learned a lot about how to work with Three.js. Now you know how to create a basic scene, add lighting, and configure the material for your meshes. In <a href="B18726_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor028"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">The Basic Components That Make Up a Three.js Scene</em>, we touched upon (but didn’t really go into) the details of the available geometries that Three.js provides and that you can use to create your 3D objects. In this chapter and <a href="B18726_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor101"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Exploring Advanced Geometries</em>, we’ll walk you through all the geometries that Three.js provides out of the box (except <code>THREE.Line</code>, which we discussed in <a href="B18726_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor056"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Working with </em><em class="italic">Three.js Materials</em>).</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we’ll look at the following geometries:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>THREE.CircleGeometry</code></li>
				<li><code>THREE.RingGeometry</code></li>
				<li><code>THREE.PlaneGeometry</code></li>
				<li><code>THREE.ShapeGeometry</code></li>
				<li><code>THREE.BoxGeometry</code></li>
				<li><code>THREE.SphereGeometry</code></li>
				<li><code>THREE.CylinderGeometry</code></li>
				<li><code>THREE.ConeGeometry</code></li>
				<li><code>THREE.TorusGeometry</code></li>
				<li><code>THREE.TorusKnotGeometry</code></li>
				<li><code>THREE.PolyhedronGeometry</code></li>
				<li><code>THREE.IcosahedronGeometry</code></li>
				<li><code>THREE.OctahedronGeometry</code></li>
				<li><code>THREE.TetraHedronGeometry</code></li>
				<li><code>THREE.DodecahedronGeometry</code></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Before we look into the geometries provided by Three.js, we’ll first look a bit deeper into how Three.js represents geometries internally as <code>THREE.BufferGeometry</code>. In some documentation, you might still encounter <code>THREE.Geometry</code> as a base object for all geometries. This has been replaced completely in the newer version by <code>THREE.BufferGeometry</code>, which generally provides better performance, since it can easily get its data to the GPU. It is, however, a bit more difficult to use than the old <code>THREE.Geometry</code>.</p>
			<p>With <code>THREE.BufferGeometry</code>, all properties of geometry are identified by a set of attributes. An attribute is basically an array with some additional metadata that contains information about the position of the vertices. Attributes are also used to store additional information about a vertex – for example, its color. To use an attribute to define a vertex and a face, you use the following two properties of <code>THREE.BufferGeometry</code>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>attributes</code>: The <code>attributes</code> properties are used to store information that can be directly passed to the GPU. For instance, for defining a shape, you define a <code>Float32Array</code>, where every three values define the position of a vertex.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Each of the three vertices is then interpreted as a face. This can be defined in <code>THREE.BufferGeometry</code> like this: <code>geometry.setAttribute( 'position', new THREE.BufferAttribute( arrayOfVertices, 3 ) );</code>.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>index</code>: By default, faces don’t need to be explicitly defined (every three consecutive positions are interpreted as a single face), but using the <code>index</code> property, we can explicitly define which vertices together form a face: <code>geometry.setIndex( </code><code>indicesArray );</code>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For using the geometries in this chapter, you don’t need to think about these internal attributes, since Three.js takes care of setting them correctly when you construct a geometry. If you want to create a geometry from scratch, though, you need to use the properties shown in the previous list.</p>
			<p>In Three.js, we have a couple of geometries that result in a 2D mesh, and a larger number of geometries that create a 3D mesh. In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>2D geometries</li>
				<li>3D geometries</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-84"><a id="_idTextAnchor083"/>2D geometries</h1>
			<p>2D objects look like flat objects<a id="_idIndexMarker410"/> and, as the name implies, only have two dimensions. In this section, we’ll first look at the 2D geometries: <code>THREE.CircleGeometry</code>, <code>THREE.RingGeometry</code>, <code>THREE.PlaneGeometry</code>, and <code>THREE.ShapeGeometry</code>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-85"><a id="_idTextAnchor084"/>THREE.PlaneGeometry</h2>
			<p>A <code>THREE.PlaneGeometry</code> object can<a id="_idIndexMarker411"/> be used to create a very simple 2D <a id="_idIndexMarker412"/>rectangle. For an example of this geometry, look at the <code>plane-geometry.html</code> example in the sources for this chapter. A rectangle that was created using <code>THREE.PlaneGeometry</code> is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.01_B18726.jpg" alt="Figure 5.1 – Plane geometry"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.1 – Plane geometry</p>
			<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker413"/>examples for this chapter, we’ve added a control GUI that you can use to control the properties of the geometry (in this case, <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, <code>widthSegments</code>, and <code>heightSegments</code>), and also change the material (and its properties), disable shadows, and hide the ground plane. For instance, if you want to<a id="_idIndexMarker414"/> see the individual faces of this shape, you can easily show them by disabling the ground plane and enabling the <code>wireframe</code> property of the selected material:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.02_B18726.jpg" alt="Figure 5.2 – Plane geometry as a wireframe"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.2 – Plane geometry as a wireframe</p>
			<p>Creating<a id="_idIndexMarker415"/> a <code>THREE.PlaneGeometry</code> object is very simple, and is<a id="_idIndexMarker416"/> done as follows:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
new THREE.PlaneGeometry(width, height, widthSegments, heightSegments)</pre>
			<p>In this example for <code>THREE.PlaneGeometry</code>, you can change these properties and directly see the effect it has on the resulting 3D object. An explanation of these properties<a id="_idIndexMarker417"/> is shown in the following list:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>width</code>: This is the width of the rectangle.</li>
				<li><code>height</code>: This is the height of the rectangle.</li>
				<li><code>widthSegments</code>: This is the number of segments that the width should be divided into. This defaults to 1.</li>
				<li><code>heightSegments</code>: This is the <a id="_idIndexMarker418"/>number of segments the height should be divided into. This defaults to 1.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As you <a id="_idIndexMarker419"/>can see, this is not a very complex geometry. You just specify the size, and you’re done. If you want to create more faces (for example, when you want to create a checkered pattern), you can use the <code>widthSegments</code> and <code>heightSegments</code> properties to divide the geometry into smaller faces.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">If you want to access the properties of a geometry after it has been created, you can’t just say <code>plane.width</code>. To access the properties of a geometry, you have to use the <code>parameters</code> property of the object. So, to get the <code>width</code> property of the plane object we created in this section, you’d have to use <code>plane.parameters.width</code>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-86"><a id="_idTextAnchor085"/>THREE.CircleGeometry</h2>
			<p>You can probably already guess <a id="_idIndexMarker420"/>what <code>THREE.CircleGeometry</code> creates. With <a id="_idIndexMarker421"/>this geometry, you can create a very simple 2D circle (or part of a circle). First, let’s look at the example for this geometry, <code>circle-geometry.html</code>.</p>
			<p>In the following screenshot, you can find an example where we created a <code>THREE.CircleGeometry</code> object with a <code>thetaLength</code> value that is smaller than <code>2 * </code><code>PI</code>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.03_B18726.jpg" alt="Figure 5.3 – 2D circle geometry"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.3 – 2D circle geometry</p>
			<p>In this example, you <a id="_idIndexMarker422"/>can see and control a mesh that’s been created<a id="_idIndexMarker423"/> by using <code>THREE.CircleGeometry</code>. <code>2 * PI</code> represents a complete circle in radians. If you’d rather work with degrees than radians, converting between them is very easy.</p>
			<p>The following two functions can help you to convert between radians and degrees, as follows:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
const deg2rad = (degrees) =&gt; (degrees * Math.PI) / 180
const rad2deg = (radians) =&gt; (radians * 180) / Math.PI</pre>
			<p>When you create <code>THREE.CircleGeometry</code>, you can specify a few properties that define what the circle looks like, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>radius</code>: The <a id="_idIndexMarker424"/>radius of a circle defines its size. The radius is the distance from the center of the circle to its edge. The default value is 50.</li>
				<li><code>segments</code>: This property defines the number of faces that are used to create the circle. The minimum number is 3, and if not specified, this number defaults to 8. A higher value means a smoother circle.</li>
				<li><code>thetaStart</code>: This property defines the position from which to start drawing the circle. This value can range from 0 to <code>2 * PI</code>, and the default value is 0.</li>
				<li><code>thetaLength</code>: This property defines to what extent the circle is complete. This defaults to <code>2 * PI</code> (a full circle) when not specified. For instance, if you specify <code>0.5 * PI</code> for this value, you’ll get a quarter circle. Use this property together with the <code>thetaStart</code> property<a id="_idIndexMarker425"/> to define the shape of a circle.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can<a id="_idIndexMarker426"/> create a full circle by just specifying the <code>radius</code> and the <code>segments</code>:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
new THREE.CircleGeometry(3, 12)</pre>
			<p>If you wanted to create half a circle from this geometry, you’d use something like this:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
new THREE.CircleGeometry(3, 12, 0, Math.PI);</pre>
			<p>This creates a circle with a <code>radius</code> of <code>3</code> that is split into <code>12</code> segments. The circle starts at a default of <code>0</code> and is only drawn halfway since we specify <code>thetaLength</code> as <code>Math.PI</code>, which is half a circle.</p>
			<p>Before moving on to the next geometry, here’s a quick note on the orientation that Three.js uses when creating these 2D shapes (<code>THREE.PlaneGeometry</code>, <code>THREE.CircleGeometry</code>, <code>THREE.RingGeometry</code>, and <code>THREE.ShapeGeometry</code>): Three.js creates these objects standing up, so they are aligned along the <em class="italic">x</em>-<em class="italic">y</em> plane. This is very logical since they are 2D shapes. However, often, especially with <code>THREE.PlaneGeometry</code>, you want to have the mesh lying down on the ground (the <em class="italic">x</em>-<em class="italic">z</em> plane), as some sort of ground area on which you can position the rest of your objects. The easiest way to create a 2D object that is horizontally orientated instead of vertical <a id="_idIndexMarker427"/>is by rotating the mesh a quarter rotation backward (<code>-PI/2</code>) around its <em class="italic">x-</em>axis, as follows:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
mesh.rotation.x =- Math.PI/2;</pre>
			<p>That’s all <a id="_idIndexMarker428"/>for <code>THREE.CircleGeometry</code>. The next geometry, <code>THREE.RingGeometry</code>, looks a lot like <code>THREE.CircleGeometry</code>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-87"><a id="_idTextAnchor086"/>THREE.RingGeometry</h2>
			<p>With <code>THREE.RingGeometry</code>, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker429"/>create a 2D object that not only <a id="_idIndexMarker430"/>closely resembles <code>THREE.CircleGeometry</code>, but also allows you to define a hole in the center (see <code>ring-geometry.html</code>):</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.04_B18726.jpg" alt="Figure 5.4 – 2D ring geometry"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.4 – 2D ring geometry</p>
			<p>When<a id="_idIndexMarker431"/> creating a <code>THREE.RingGeometry</code> object, you can use the following properties:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>innerRadius</code>: The inner<a id="_idIndexMarker432"/> radius of a circle defines the size of the center hole. If this property is set to <code>0</code>, no hole will be shown. The default value is 0.</li>
				<li><code>outerRadius</code>: The outer radius of a circle defines its size. The radius is the distance from the center of the circle to its edge. The default value is 50.</li>
				<li><code>thetaSegments</code>: This is the number of diagonal segments that will be used to create the circle. A higher value means a smoother ring. The default value is 8.</li>
				<li><code>phiSegments</code>: This is the number of segments required to be used along the length of the ring. The default value is 8. This doesn’t really affect the smoothness of the circle but increases the number of faces.</li>
				<li><code>thetaStart</code>: This defines the position from which to start drawing the circle. This value can range from 0 to <code>2 * PI</code>, and the default value is 0.</li>
				<li><code>thetaLength</code>: This defines the extent to which the circle is complete. This defaults to <code>2 * PI</code> (a full circle) when not specified. For instance, if you specify <code>0.5 * PI</code> for this value, you’ll get a quarter circle. Use this property together with the <code>thetaStart</code> property to define the shape of the ring.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following screenshot shows how <code>thetaStart</code> and <code>thetaLength</code> work with <code>THREE.RingGeometry</code>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.05_B18726.jpg" alt="Figure 5.5 – 2D ring geometry with different theta"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.5 – 2D ring geometry with different theta</p>
			<p>In the next section, we’ll look at the last of the 2D shapes: <code>THREE.ShapeGeometry</code>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-88"><a id="_idTextAnchor087"/>THREE.ShapeGeometry</h2>
			<p><code>THREE.PlaneGeometry</code> and <code>THREE.CircleGeometry</code> have limited ways of customizing their appearance. If <a id="_idIndexMarker433"/>you <a id="_idIndexMarker434"/>want to create custom 2D shapes, you can use <code>THREE.ShapeGeometry</code>.</p>
			<p>With <code>THREE.ShapeGeometry</code>, you have a couple of functions you can call to create your own shapes. You can compare this functionality with the <code>&lt;path/&gt;</code> element functionality, which is also available to the HTML canvas element and SVG. Let’s start with an example and after that, we’ll show you how you can use the various functions to draw your own shape. The <code>shape-geometry.html</code> example can be found in the sources of this chapter.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows this example:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.06_B18726.jpg" alt="Figure 5.6 – A custom shape geometry"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.6 – A custom shape geometry</p>
			<p>In this <a id="_idIndexMarker435"/>example, you can see a custom-created 2D shape. Before going<a id="_idIndexMarker436"/> into the description of the properties, first, let’s look at the code that is used to create this shape. Before we create a <code>THREE.ShapeGeometry</code> object, we first have to create a <code>THREE.Shape</code> object. You can trace these steps by looking at the previous screenshot, where we start in the bottom-right corner. Here’s how we created a <code>THREE.Shape</code> object:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
const drawShape = () =&gt; {
  // create a basic shape
  const shape = new THREE.Shape()
  // startpoint
  // straight line upwards
  shape.lineTo(10, 40)
  // the top of the figure, curve to the right
  shape.bezierCurveTo(15, 25, 25, 25, 30, 40)
  // spline back down
  shape.splineThru([new THREE.Vector2(32, 30), new
    THREE.Vector2(28, 20), new THREE.Vector2(30, 10)])
  // add 'eye' hole one
  const hole1 = new THREE.Path()
  hole1.absellipse(16, 24, 2, 3, 0, Math.PI * 2, true)
  shape.holes.push(hole1)
  // add 'eye hole 2'
  const hole2 = new THREE.Path()
  hole2.absellipse(23, 24, 2, 3, 0, Math.PI * 2, true)
  shape.holes.push(hole2)
  // add 'mouth'
  const hole3 = new THREE.Path()
  hole3.absarc(20, 16, 2, 0, Math.PI, true)
  shape.holes.push(hole3)
  return shape
}</pre>
			<p>In this piece<a id="_idIndexMarker437"/> of code, you can see that we created the outline of this <a id="_idIndexMarker438"/>shape using lines, curves, and splines. After that, we punched a number of holes into this shape by using the <code>holes</code> property of <code>THREE.Shape</code>.</p>
			<p>In this section, though, we’re talking about <code>THREE.ShapeGeometry</code> and not <code>THREE.Shape</code> – to create a geometry from <code>THREE.Shape</code>, we need to pass in <code>THREE.Shape</code> (returned, in our case, from the <code>drawShape()</code> function) as the argument to <code>THREE.ShapeGeometry</code>. You can also pass in an array of a <code>THREE.Shape</code> object, but in our example, we only use one object:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
new THREE.ShapeGeometry(drawShape())</pre>
			<p>The result of this function is a geometry that can be used to <a id="_idIndexMarker439"/>create a mesh. Besides the shape you want to convert into <code>THREE.ShapeGeometry</code>, you can also pass in a number of <a id="_idIndexMarker440"/>additional options objects as the second argument:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>curveSegments</code>: This property determines how smooth the curves created from the shape are. The default value is 12.</li>
				<li><code>material</code>: This is the <code>materialIndex</code> property that is used for the faces that are created for the speciﬁed shapes. So, if you pass in multiple materials, you can specify which of those materials should be applied to the faces of the shape that is created.</li>
				<li><code>UVGenerator</code>: When you use a texture with your material, the UV mapping determines what part of a texture is used for a speciﬁc face. With the <code>UVGenerator</code> property, you can pass in your own object, which will create the UV settings for the faces that are created for the shapes passed in. More information on UV settings can be found in <a href="B18726_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor171"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Loading and Working with Textures</em>. If none are speciﬁed, <code>THREE.ExtrudeGeometry.WorldUVGenerator</code> is used.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The most important part of <code>THREE.ShapeGeometry</code> is <code>THREE.Shape</code>, which you use to create the shape, so let’s look at the list of drawing functions you can use to create <code>THREE.Shape</code>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>moveTo(x,y)</code>: Move the drawing position to the <code>x-</code> and <code>y-c</code>oordinates that are specified.</li>
				<li><code>lineTo(x,y)</code>: Draw a line from the current position (for example, set by the <code>moveTo</code> function) to the <code>x-</code> and <code>y-c</code>oordinates that have been provided.</li>
				<li><code>quadraticCurveTo(aCPx, aCPy, x, y)</code>: There are two different ways of specifying curves. You can use the <code>quadraticCurveTo</code> function, or you can use the <code>bezierCurveTo</code> function. The difference between these two functions is how you specify the curvature of the curve.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For a quadratic curve, we need to specify one additional point (using the <code>aCPx</code> and <code>aCPy</code> arguments), and the curve is based solely on that point and, of course, the specified endpoint (from the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> arguments). For a cubic curve (used by the <code>bezierCurveTo</code> function), you specify two additional points to define the curve. The starting point is the current position of the path.</p>
			<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker441"/>diagram explains the differences between these<a id="_idIndexMarker442"/> two options:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.07_B18726.jpg" alt="Figure 5.7 – Quadratic bezier and cubic bezier"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.7 – Quadratic bezier and cubic bezier</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>bezierCurveTo(aCPx1, aCPy1, aCPx2, aCPy2, x, y)</code>: This draws a curve based on the arguments supplied. For an explanation, see the previous list entry. The curve is drawn based on the two coordinates that define the curve (<code>aCPx1</code>, <code>aCPy1</code>, <code>aCPx2</code>, and <code>aCPy2</code>) and the end coordinates (<code>x</code> and <code>y</code>). The starting point is the current position of the path.</li>
				<li><code>splineThru(pts)</code>: This function draws a fluid line through the set of coordinates provided, (<code>pts</code>). This argument should be an array of <code>THREE.Vector2</code> objects. The starting point is the current position of the path.</li>
				<li><code>arc(aX, aY, aRadius, aStartAngle, aEndAngle, aClockwise)</code>: This draws a circle (or part of a circle). The circle starts from the current position of the path. Here, <code>aX</code> and <code>aY</code> are used as offsets from the current position. Note that <code>aRadius</code> sets the size of the circle and <code>aStartAngle</code> and <code>aEndAngle</code> define how large a part of the circle is drawn. The Boolean <code>aClockwise</code> property determines whether the circle is drawn clockwise or counterclockwise.</li>
				<li><code>absArc(aX, aY, aRadius, aStartAngle, aEndAngle, AClockwise)</code>: See the description of the <code>arc</code> property. The position is absolute instead of relative to the current position.</li>
				<li><code>ellipse(aX, aY, xRadius, yRadius, aStartAngle, aEndAngle, aClockwise)</code>: See the description of the <code>arc</code> property. As an addition, with the <code>ellipse</code> function, we can separately set the <code>x</code> radius and the <code>y</code> radius.</li>
				<li><code>absEllipse(aX, aY, xRadius, yRadius, aStartAngle, aEndAngle, aClockwise)</code>: See the description of the <code>ellipse</code> property. The position is absolute instead of relative to the current position.</li>
				<li><code>fromPoints(vectors)</code>: If you pass in an array of <code>THREE.Vector2</code> (or <code>THREE.Vector3</code>) objects into this function, Three.js will create a path using straight lines from the supplied vectors.</li>
				<li><code>holes</code>: The <code>holes</code> property contains an array of <code>THREE.Shape</code> objects. Each of the objects in this array is rendered as a hole. A good example of this is the example we saw at the beginning of this section. In that code fragment, we added three <code>THREE.Shape</code> objects to this array: one <a id="_idIndexMarker443"/>for the left eye, one for the right<a id="_idIndexMarker444"/> eye, and one for the mouth of our main <code>THREE.Shape</code> object.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Just like for a lot of examples, to understand how the various properties affect the final shape, the easiest way is to just enable the <code>wireframe</code> property on the material and play around with the settings. For example, the following screenshot shows what happens when you use a low value for <code>curveSegments</code>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.08_B18726.jpg" alt="Figure 5.8 – The wireframe of a shape geometry"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.8 – The wireframe of a shape geometry</p>
			<p>As you<a id="_idIndexMarker445"/> can see, the shape loses its nice, round edges, but uses a lot<a id="_idIndexMarker446"/> fewer faces in the process. That’s it for the 2D shapes. The following sections will show and explain the basic 3D shapes.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-89"><a id="_idTextAnchor088"/>3D geometries</h1>
			<p>In this section on basic <a id="_idIndexMarker447"/>3D geometries, we’ll start with a geometry we’ve already seen a couple of times: <code>THREE.BoxGeometry</code>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-90"><a id="_idTextAnchor089"/>THREE.BoxGeometry</h2>
			<p><code>THREE.BoxGeometry</code> is a very <a id="_idIndexMarker448"/>simple 3D geometry that allows you to create a box by specifying its <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, and <code>depth</code> properties. We’ve added an<a id="_idIndexMarker449"/> example, <code>box-geometry.html</code>, where you can play around with these properties. The following screenshot shows this geometry:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.09_B18726.jpg" alt="Figure 5.9 – Basic 3D box geometry"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.9 – Basic 3D box geometry</p>
			<p>As you can see in this example, by changing the <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, and <code>depth</code> properties of <code>THREE.BoxGeometry</code>, you can control the size of the resulting mesh. These three properties<a id="_idIndexMarker450"/> are also mandatory when you create a new cube, as follows:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
new THREE.BoxGeometry(10,10,10);</pre>
			<p>In the example, you can also see a couple of other properties that you can define on the cube. The following list <a id="_idIndexMarker451"/>explains all the properties:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>width</code>: This is the width of the cube. This is the length of the vertices of the cube along the <em class="italic">x-</em>axis.</li>
				<li><code>height</code>: This is the height of the cube. This is the length of the vertices of the cube along the <em class="italic">y-</em>axis.</li>
				<li><code>depth</code>: This is the depth of the cube. This is the length of the vertices of the cube along the <em class="italic">z-</em>axis.</li>
				<li><code>widthSegments</code>: This is the number of segments into which we divide a face along the cube’s <em class="italic">x-</em>axis. The default value is 1. The more segments you define, the more faces a side has. If this property and the next two are set to <code>1</code>, each side of the cube will just have 2 faces. If this property is set to <code>2</code>, the face will be divided into 2 segments, resulting in 4 faces.</li>
				<li><code>heightSegments</code>: This is the number of segments into which we divide a face along the cube’s <em class="italic">y-</em>axis. The default value is 1.</li>
				<li><code>depthSegments</code>: This is the number of segments into which we divide a face along the cube’s <em class="italic">z-</em>axis. The default value is 1.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By increasing the various segment properties, you divide the six main faces of the cube into smaller faces. This is useful if you want to set specific material properties on parts of the<a id="_idIndexMarker452"/> cube using <code>THREE.MeshFaceMaterial</code>.</p>
			<p><code>THREE.BoxGeometry</code> is a very simple geometry. Another simple one is <code>THREE.SphereGeometry</code>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-91"><a id="_idTextAnchor090"/>THREE.SphereGeometry</h2>
			<p>With <code>THREE.SphereGeometry</code>, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker453"/>create a <a id="_idIndexMarker454"/>3D sphere. Let’s dive straight into the example, <code>sphere-geometry.html</code>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.10_B18726.jpg" alt="Figure 5.10 – Simple 3D sphere geometry"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.10 – Simple 3D sphere geometry</p>
			<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker455"/>previous screenshot, we have shown you a half-open <a id="_idIndexMarker456"/>sphere that was created based on <code>THREE.SphereGeometry</code>. This geometry is a very flexible one and can be used to create all kinds of sphere-related geometries. A basic <code>THREE.SphereGeometry</code> instance, though, can be created as easily as this: <code>new THREE.SphereGeometry()</code>.</p>
			<p>The following properties can be used to tune what the resulting mesh looks like:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>radius</code>: This is used to set the radius for the sphere. This defines how large the resulting mesh will be. The default value is 50.</li>
				<li> <code>widthSegments</code>: This is the number of segments to be used vertically. More segments mean a smoother surface. The default value is 8 and the minimum value is 3.</li>
				<li> <code>heightSegments</code>: This is the number of segments to be used horizontally. The more segments, the smoother the surface of the sphere. The default value is 6 and the minimum value is 2.</li>
				<li> <code>phiStart</code>: This determines where to start drawing the sphere along its <em class="italic">x-</em>axis. This can range from 0 to <code>2 * PI</code>. The default value is <code>0</code>.</li>
				<li> <code>phiLength</code>: This determines how far from <code>phiStart</code> the sphere is to be drawn. <code>2 * PI</code> will draw a full sphere and <code>0.5 * PI</code> will draw an open quarter-sphere. The default value is <code>2 * </code><code>PI</code>.</li>
				<li> <code>thetaStart</code>: This determines where to start drawing the sphere along its <em class="italic">x-</em>axis. This can range from 0 to <code>2 * PI</code>, and the default value is 0.</li>
				<li> <code>thetaLength</code>: This determines how far from <code>thetaStart</code> the sphere is drawn. The <code>2 * PI</code> value is a full sphere, whereas <code>PI</code> will draw only half of the sphere. The default value is <code>2 * </code><code>PI</code>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The <code>radius</code>, <code>widthSegments</code>, and <code>heightSegments</code> properties should be clear. We’ve already<a id="_idIndexMarker457"/> seen these kinds of properties in other examples. The <code>phiStart</code>, <code>phiLength</code>, <code>thetaStart</code>, and <code>thetaLength</code> properties<a id="_idIndexMarker458"/> are a bit harder to understand without looking at an example. Luckily, though, you can experiment with these properties from the menu in the <code>sphere-geometry.html</code> example and create interesting geometries such as these:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.11_B18726.jpg" alt="Figure 5.11 – Sphere geometry with different phi and theta properties"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.11 – Sphere geometry with different phi and theta properties</p>
			<p>The next<a id="_idIndexMarker459"/> one on the<a id="_idIndexMarker460"/> list is <code>THREE.CylinderGeometry</code>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-92"><a id="_idTextAnchor091"/>THREE.CylinderGeometry</h2>
			<p>With this geometry, we <a id="_idIndexMarker461"/>can<a id="_idIndexMarker462"/> create cylinders and cylindrical objects. As for all the other geometries, we also have an example (<code>cylinder-geometry.html</code>) that lets you experiment with the properties of this geometry, the screenshot for which is as follows:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.12_B18726.jpg" alt="Figure 5.12 – 3D cylinder geometry"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.12 – 3D cylinder geometry</p>
			<p>When you create <code>THREE.CylinderGeometry</code>, there aren’t any mandatory arguments, so you can create a cylinder by just calling <code>new THREE.CylinderGeometry()</code>. You can pass in a number of properties, as you can see in the <a id="_idIndexMarker463"/>preceding example, to alter the appearance of this cylinder. The <a id="_idIndexMarker464"/>properties are explained in the following list:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>radiusTop</code>: This sets the size that this cylinder will be at the top. The default value is 20.</li>
				<li><code>radiusBottom</code>: This sets the size that this cylinder will be at the bottom. The default value is 20.</li>
				<li><code>height</code>: This property sets the height of the cylinder. The default height is 100.</li>
				<li><code>radialSegments</code>: This determines the number of segments along the radius of the cylinder. This defaults to 8. More segments mean a smoother cylinder.</li>
				<li><code>heightSegments</code>: This determines the number of segments along the height of the cylinder. The default value is 1. More segments mean more faces.</li>
				<li><code>openEnded</code>: This determines whether or not the mesh is closed at the top and the bottom. The default value is <code>false</code>.</li>
				<li><code>thetaStart</code>: This determines where to start drawing the cylinder along its <em class="italic">x-</em>axis. This can range from 0 to <code>2 * PI</code>, and the default value is 0.</li>
				<li><code>thetaLength</code>: This determines how far from <code>thetaStart</code> the cylinder is drawn. The <code>2 * PI</code> value is a full cylinder, whereas <code>PI</code> will draw only half of a cylinder. The default value is <code>2 * </code><code>PI</code>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are all very basic properties that you can use to configure a cylinder. One interesting aspect, though, is when you use a negative <code>radius</code> value for the top (or for the bottom). If you do this, you<a id="_idIndexMarker465"/> can use this geometry to create an hourglass-like shape, as shown in the <a id="_idIndexMarker466"/>following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.13_B18726.jpg" alt="Figure 5.13 – 3D cylinder geometry as an hourglass"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.13 – 3D cylinder geometry as an hourglass</p>
			<p>One thing<a id="_idIndexMarker467"/> to note here is that the top half, in this case, is turned inside<a id="_idIndexMarker468"/> out. If you use a material that isn’t configured with <code>THREE.DoubleSide</code>, you won’t see the top half.</p>
			<p>The next geometry is <code>THREE.ConeGeometry</code>, which provides the basic functionalities of <code>THREE.CylinderGeometry</code>, but has the top radius fixed to zero.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-93"><a id="_idTextAnchor092"/>THREE.ConeGeometry</h2>
			<p><code>THREE.ConeGeometry</code> is pretty <a id="_idIndexMarker469"/>much the same as <code>THREE.CylinderGeometry</code>. It <a id="_idIndexMarker470"/>uses all the same properties, except it only allows you to set the radius instead of  separate <code>radiusTop</code> and <code>radiusBottom</code> values:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.14_B18726.jpg" alt="Figure 5.14 – Simple 3D cone geometry"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.14 – Simple 3D cone geometry</p>
			<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker471"/>properties can be set on <code>THREE.ConeGeometry</code>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>radius</code>: This sets the size <a id="_idIndexMarker472"/>that this cylinder will be at the bottom. The default value is <code>20</code>.</li>
				<li><code>height</code>: This property sets the height of the cylinder. The default height is 100.</li>
				<li><code>radialSegments</code>: This determines the number of segments along the radius of the cylinder. This defaults to 8. More segments mean a smoother cylinder.</li>
				<li><code>heightSegments</code>: This determines the number of segments along the height of the cylinder. The default value is 1. More segments mean more faces.</li>
				<li><code>openEnded</code>: This determines whether or not the mesh is closed at the top and the bottom. The default value is <code>false</code>.</li>
				<li><code>thetaStart</code>: This determines where to start drawing the cylinder along its <em class="italic">x-</em>axis. This can range from 0 to <code>2 * PI</code>, and the default value is 0.</li>
				<li><code>thetaLength</code>: This determines how far from <code>thetaStart</code> the cylinder is drawn. The <code>2 * PI</code> value is<a id="_idIndexMarker473"/> a full cylinder, whereas <code>PI</code> will draw only half of a <a id="_idIndexMarker474"/>cylinder. The default value is <code>2 * </code><code>PI</code>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The next geometry, <code>THREE.TorusGeometry</code>, allows you to create a donut-like shaped object.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-94"><a id="_idTextAnchor093"/>THREE.TorusGeometry</h2>
			<p>A torus<a id="_idIndexMarker475"/> is a simple<a id="_idIndexMarker476"/> shape that looks like a donut. The following <a id="_idIndexMarker477"/>screenshot, which you can get yourself by opening the <code>torus-geometry.html</code> example, shows <code>THREE.TorusGeometry</code> in action:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.15_B18726.jpg" alt="Figure 5.15 – 3D torus geometry"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.15 – 3D torus geometry</p>
			<p>Just like most <a id="_idIndexMarker478"/>of the simple geometries, there aren’t any mandatory arguments when creating <code>THREE.TorusGeometry</code>. The following list mentions the <a id="_idIndexMarker479"/>arguments you can specify when you create this geometry:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>radius</code>: This sets the size of the complete torus. The default value is 100.</li>
				<li><code>tube</code>: This sets the radius of the tube (the actual donut). The default value for this attribute is 40.</li>
				<li><code>radialSegments</code>: This determines the number of segments to be used along the length of the torus. The default value is 8. See the effect of changing this value in the example.</li>
				<li><code>tubularSegments</code>: This determines the number of segments to be used along the width of the torus. The default value is 6. See the effect of changing this value in the example.</li>
				<li><code>arc</code>: With this property, you can control whether the torus draws a full circle. The default of this value is <code>2 * PI</code> (a full circle).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Most of these <a id="_idIndexMarker480"/>are very basic properties that you’ve already seen. The <code>arc</code> property, however, is a very interesting one. With this property, you can define whether the donut makes a full circle or only a partial one. By experimenting with this property, you can create very interesting meshes, such as the following one with <code>arc</code> set to a value lower than <code>2 * </code><code>PI</code>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.16_B18726.jpg" alt="Figure 5.16 – 3D torus geometry with a smaller arc property"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.16 – 3D torus geometry with a smaller arc property</p>
			<p><code>THREE.TorusGeometry</code> is a very<a id="_idIndexMarker481"/> straightforward geometry. In the next section, we’ll look at a geometry that almost shares its name but is much less straightforward: <code>THREE.TorusKnotGeometry</code>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-95"><a id="_idTextAnchor094"/>THREE.TorusKnotGeometry</h2>
			<p>With <code>THREE.TorusKnotGeometry</code>, you<a id="_idIndexMarker482"/> can create a torus knot. A torus knot is a special kind of knot that looks <a id="_idIndexMarker483"/>like a tube that winds around itself a couple of times. The best way to explain this is by looking at the <code>torus-knot-geometry.html</code> example. The following screenshot shows this geometry:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.17_B18726.jpg" alt="Figure 5.17 – Torus knot geometry"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.17 – Torus knot geometry</p>
			<p>If you <a id="_idIndexMarker484"/>open this example and play around with the <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> properties, you can create all kinds of beautiful geometries. The <code>p</code> property <a id="_idIndexMarker485"/>defines how often the knot winds around its axis, and <code>q</code> defines how much the knot winds around its interior.</p>
			<p>If this sounds a bit vague, don’t worry. You don’t need to understand these properties to create beautiful knots, such as the one shown in the following screenshot (for those interested in the details, Wolfram has a good article on this subject at <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TorusKnot.html">https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TorusKnot.html</a>):</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.18_B18726.jpg" alt="Figure 5.18 – Torus knot geometry with different p and q values"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.18 – Torus knot geometry with different p and q values</p>
			<p>With the<a id="_idIndexMarker486"/> example for this geometry, you can play around with the<a id="_idIndexMarker487"/> following properties and see the effect that various combinations of <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> have on this geometry:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>radius</code>: This sets the size of the complete torus. The default value is 100.</li>
				<li><code>tube</code>: This sets the radius of the tube (the actual donut). The default value for this attribute is 40.</li>
				<li><code>radialSegments</code>: This determines the number of segments to be used along the length of the torus knot. The default value is 64. See the effect of changing this value in the demo.</li>
				<li><code>tubularSegments</code>: This determines the number of segments to be used along the width of the torus knot. The default value is 8. See the effect of changing this value in the demo.</li>
				<li><code>p</code>: This defines the shape of the knot, and the default value is 2.</li>
				<li><code>q</code>: This defines the shape of the knot, and the default value is 3.</li>
				<li><code>heightScale</code>: With this<a id="_idIndexMarker488"/> property, you can stretch <a id="_idIndexMarker489"/>out the torus knot. The default value is 1.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The next geometry on the list is the last one of the basic geometries: <code>THREE.PolyhedronGeometry</code>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-96"><a id="_idTextAnchor095"/>THREE.PolyhedronGeometry</h2>
			<p>With this geometry, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker490"/>easily create polyhedrons. A polyhedron<a id="_idIndexMarker491"/> is a geometry that has only flat faces and straight<a id="_idIndexMarker492"/> edges. Most often, though, you won’t use <code>THREE.PolyhedronGeometry</code> directly. Three.js provides a number of specific polyhedrons you can use without having to specify the vertices and faces of <code>THREE.PolyhedronGeometry</code>. We’ll discuss these polyhedrons later on in this section.</p>
			<p>If you do want to use <code>THREE.PolyhedronGeometry</code> directly, you have to specify the vertices and the faces (just as we did for the cube in <a href="B18726_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor040"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Working with Light Sources in Three.js</em>). For instance, we can create a simple tetrahedron (also see the section on <code>THREE.TetrahedronGeometry</code> in this chapter) like this:</p>
			<pre class="source-code">
const vertices = [
 1,  1,  1,
-1, -1,  1,
-1,  1, -1,
 1, -1, -1
];
const indices = [
2,  1,  0,
0,  3,  2,
1,  3,  0,
2,  3,  1
];
new THREE.PolyhedronBufferGeometry(vertices, indices, radius, detail)</pre>
			<p>To construct <code>THREE.PolyhedronGeometry</code>, we pass in the <code>vertices</code>, <code>indices</code>, <code>radius</code>, and <code>detail</code> properties. The <a id="_idIndexMarker493"/>resulting <code>THREE.PolyhedronGeometry</code> object is shown<a id="_idIndexMarker494"/> in the <code>polyhedron-geometry.html</code> example:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.19_B18726.jpg" alt="Figure 5.19 – Custom polyhedron"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.19 – Custom polyhedron</p>
			<p>When you create a polyhedron, you can pass in the following four properties:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>vertices</code>: These are the points that make up the polyhedron.</li>
				<li><code>indices</code>: These are the faces that need to be created from the vertices.</li>
				<li><code>radius</code>: This is the size of the polyhedron. This defaults to 1.</li>
				<li><code>detail</code>: With this property, you can add additional detail to the polyhedron. If you set this to <code>1</code>, each triangle in the polyhedron will be split into 4 smaller triangles. If you set this to <code>2</code>, those 4 smaller triangles will each be split into 4 smaller triangles once more, and so on.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker495"/>screenshot shows the same custom mesh, but<a id="_idIndexMarker496"/> now with a higher level of detail:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.20_B18726.jpg" alt="Figure 5.20 – A custom polyhedron with a higher level of detai"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.20 – A custom polyhedron with a higher level of detai</p>
			<p>At the beginning of this section, we mentioned that Three.js comes with a couple of polyhedrons out of the box. In the <a id="_idIndexMarker497"/>following subsections, we’ll quickly show you these. All of these <a id="_idIndexMarker498"/>polyhedron types can be viewed by looking at the <code>polyhedron-geometry.html</code> example.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-97"><a id="_idTextAnchor096"/>THREE.IcosahedronGeometry</h2>
			<p><code>THREE.IcosahedronGeometry</code> creates<a id="_idIndexMarker499"/> a polyhedron that has 20 identical triangular faces created<a id="_idIndexMarker500"/> from 12 vertices. When creating this polyhedron, all you need to specify are the radius and the detail level. This screenshot shows a polyhedron that was created using <code>THREE.IcosahedronGeometry</code>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.21_B18726.jpg" alt="Figure 5.21 – 3D icosahedron geometry"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.21 – 3D icosahedron geometry</p>
			<p>The next polyhedron we’re going to look at is <code>THREE.TetrahedronGeometry</code>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-98"><a id="_idTextAnchor097"/>THREE.TetrahedronGeometry</h2>
			<p>The tetrahedron is one of the <a id="_idIndexMarker501"/>simplest polyhedrons. This <a id="_idIndexMarker502"/>polyhedron only contains four triangular faces that are created from four vertices. You can create <code>THREE.TetrahedronGeometry</code> just like the other polyhedrons provided by Three.js, by specifying the radius and detail levels. Here’s a screenshot <a id="_idIndexMarker503"/>that shows a tetrahedron that was created using <code>THREE.TetrahedronGeometry</code>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.22_B18726.jpg" alt="Figure 5.22 – 3D tetrahedron geometry"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.22 – 3D tetrahedron geometry</p>
			<p>Next, we will see a polyhedron with eight faces: an octahedron.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-99"><a id="_idTextAnchor098"/>THREE.OctahedronGeometry</h2>
			<p>Three.js also provides an<a id="_idIndexMarker504"/> implementation of an octahedron. As<a id="_idIndexMarker505"/> the name implies, this polyhedron has eight faces. These faces are created from six vertices. The following screenshot shows this geometry:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.23_B18726.jpg" alt="Figure 5.23 – 3D octahedron geometry"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.23 – 3D octahedron geometry</p>
			<p>The last of the<a id="_idIndexMarker506"/> polyhedrons we’re going to look at is a <a id="_idIndexMarker507"/>dodecahedron.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-100"><a id="_idTextAnchor099"/>THREE.DodecahedronGeometry</h2>
			<p>The final polyhedron geometry provided <a id="_idIndexMarker508"/>by Three.js is <code>THREE.DodecahedronGeometry</code>. This <a id="_idIndexMarker509"/>polyhedron has 12 faces. The following screenshot shows this geometry:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.24_B18726.jpg" alt="Figure 5.24 – 3D dodecahedron geometry"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.24 – 3D dodecahedron geometry</p>
			<p>As you can see, Three.js <a id="_idIndexMarker510"/>provides a large number of 3D <a id="_idIndexMarker511"/>geometries, from directly useful ones such as spheres and cubes to geometries that probably aren’t that useful in practice, such as the set of polyhedrons. In any case, these 3D geometries will give you a good starting point for creating and experimenting with materials, geometries, and 3D scenes.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-101"><a id="_idTextAnchor100"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we discussed all of the standard geometries that Three.js has to offer. As you saw, there are a whole lot of geometries you can use right out of the box. To best learn how to use the geometries, experiment with them. Use the examples in this chapter to get to know the properties you can use to customize the standard set of geometries available from Three.js.</p>
			<p>For 2D shapes, it’s important to remember that they are placed on the <em class="italic">x</em>-<em class="italic">y</em> plane. If you want to have a 2D shape horizontally, you’ll have to rotate the mesh around the <em class="italic">x-</em>axis for <code>-0.5 * PI</code>. And finally, take care that if you’re rotating a 2D shape, or a 3D shape that is open (for example, a cylinder or a tube), remember to set the material to <code>THREE.DoubleSide</code>. If you don’t do this, the inside or the back of your geometry won’t be shown.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we focused on simple, straightforward meshes. Three.js also provides ways to create complex geometries, which we will cover in <a href="B18726_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor101"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>.</p>
