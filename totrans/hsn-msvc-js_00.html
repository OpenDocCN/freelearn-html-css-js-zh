			<h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>Hello there! Welcome to <em class="italic">Hands-On Microservices with JavaScript</em>, a journey through the fascinating intersection of one of the most popular programming languages and the ever-evolving world of microservices architecture. JavaScript, with its versatility and ubiquity, combined with the modular, scalable power of microservices, forms the perfect duo for modern software development. This book is designed to bridge these two worlds, offering a comprehensive guide to building, managing, and scaling microservices <span class="No-Break">with JavaScript.</span></p>
			<p>The rise of microservices has revolutionized the way we think about software architecture. Gone are the days when monolithic applications dominated the landscape, offering simplicity but at the cost of scalability and flexibility. Microservices, with their promise of independent, self-contained units, have brought about a new era of development: agile, resilient, and highly scalable. However, with great power comes great responsibility, and the challenges of adopting a microservices architecture should not <span class="No-Break">be underestimated.</span></p>
			<p>In this book, we’ll take you step by step through the process of understanding and implementing microservices using JavaScript. Each chapter is crafted to not only introduce you to the theoretical concepts but also to provide hands-on guidance that you can apply in <span class="No-Break">real-world scenarios.</span></p>
			<p>We will start with an introduction to microservices, exploring their core principles, benefits, and challenges. From there, we will delve into the internals of microservices, focusing on communication techniques and patterns that are essential for building robust systems. We’ll also cover the foundational knowledge you need in JavaScript and Node.js before diving into more advanced topics, such as real-time data streaming, securing your microservices, and deploying them <span class="No-Break">to production.</span></p>
			<p>This book is not just about writing code; it’s also about understanding the architectural patterns and best practices that will allow you to build scalable, maintainable, and efficient microservices. Whether you’re an experienced developer looking to expand your skill set or a newcomer eager to explore the world of microservices, this book is designed to be <span class="No-Break">your guide.</span></p>
			<p>Thank you for embarking on this journey with me. I hope this book will not only enhance your technical skills but also inspire you to push the boundaries of what you can achieve with microservices <span class="No-Break">and JavaScript.</span></p>
			<p>Let’s <span class="No-Break">dive in!</span></p>
