    stacks are created for the nested function calls, their impacts, and how to optimize

    When we execute the `next()` method of the `generator` object, it executes the
    `generator` function's body until the `yield` keyword is encountered. It returns
    the yielded value and pauses the function. When the `next()` method is called
    again, it resumes the execution and then returns the next yielded value. The `done`
    property is `true` when the `generator` function doesn't yield any value.

    finishes executing. Switching and creating the execution stacks also takes some
    additional CPU time. This problem is not noticeable when there are a couple  of hundred,
    nested levels of calls, but it''s noticeable when there are thousands or more

    case of recursion. What's special about tail calls is that there is a way to actually
    prevent the extra CPU-time and memory usage while making the tail calls, and that
