    to do with a new JavaScript framework. Well, that is about to change.

- en: Meteor is not just another JavaScript framework that you'll forget the name
    of a few weeks from now. It was created—and is continuously improved upon—by legit
    *computer scientists* driven by a vision of how software development should be.
    Their mantra is that "programming should be fun" and as you go through this list
    of Meteor recipes, you will see exactly how much fun it really is to develop applications
    using Meteor.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Meteor is modular and declarative, supports data-on-the-wire, is well supported
    by a thriving development community, and implements full-stack reactivity. This
    sounds like a bunch of meaningless buzzwords, until you fully grasp their impact
    on your day-to-day development efforts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because Meteor is modular and well supported, it works easily with all of your
    favorite JavaScript frameworks. You can use the entire Meteor stack, or you can
    mix and match it with community packages to complement your existing infrastructure
    / skill set.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Meteor supports data-on-the-wire through the Distributed Data Protocol (DDP).
    This innovation is significant in that it allows you to create elegant, powerful
    client applications responsible for their own rendering. You no longer have to
    rely on complex, outdated server technology rife with state and rendering problems
    that (frankly) should have been solved years ago. DDP is not unique to Meteor
    or even to JavaScript. DDP clients are available in nearly every major programming
    language! This opens up many elegant, powerful integration possibilities, allowing
    you to build upon existing platforms and infrastructures.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Combining DDP with full-stack reactivity opens up an entirely new way of developing
    frontend applications. Templates, database transactions, and view/controller logic
    are vastly simplified, allowing you to write clean, concise, declarative code.
    Your frontend development efforts will go from *weeks* to *hours* as you stop
    worrying about tedious state and CRUD operations and focus on rapid, elegant prototyping.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The more acquainted you become with Meteor, the more effective and prolific
    you will become as a developer. Programming with the Meteor framework is truly
    an enjoyable experience. The recipes found in this book will get you well on your
    way to being *delighted* by each project you complete and will serve as an indispensable
    reference for many projects to come.
