<h1 class="chapterTitle" id="_idParaDest-27">Installing Clip Studio Paint Pro and Interface Basics</h1>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we’re going to dive right into the thick of it and start getting to know Clip Studio Paint. First, we’ll look at the recommended system specifications for running Clip Studio Paint and how to install the program. We’ll also talk about graphics tablets, their importance, and how to obtain one.</p>
<p class="normal">Once we have installed Clip Studio Paint, we’ll get to know the interface. First, we’ll go over the parts of the default interface. Then, we’ll learn how to customize and change the interface to suit our needs, as well as how to select tools, and learn about the various palettes that comprise the Clip Studio Paint interface and their properties.</p>
<p class="normal">By the end of this chapter, you will be able to install Clip Studio Paint and identify the different parts of its interface. Although installation and navigation may sound a bit dull, it’s important to know. Once we understand the different navigation sections, the door is opened to a whole world of artistic creation. It’s like taking the first tour of a new home!</p>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we will learn about the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">System specs, installation, and your activation number</li>
<li class="bulletList">About graphics tablets</li>
<li class="bulletList">The default user interface</li>
<li class="bulletList">Moving, collapsing, and stacking palettes</li>
<li class="bulletList">Using the tool palette</li>
<li class="bulletList">Using the command bar</li>
</ul>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-28">System specs, installation, and your serial number</h1>
<p class="normal">Before installing<a id="_idIndexMarker028"/> Clip<a id="_idIndexMarker029"/> Studio <a id="_idIndexMarker030"/>Paint, we need to ensure that our computer hardware is capable of running the program. Graphics software can be taxing on system resources, so it is important to ensure that your computer is up to the task!</p>
<p class="normal">Clip Studio Paint is made for both Windows PCs as well as Mac operating systems; you pay by one-time purchase for a perpetual license. As well as Macs and PCs, it is also available on iPad, iPhone, Galaxy, Android, and Chromebook in monthly and annual usage plans. You can use the free trial version for all hardware mentioned. Once we have ensured that we can run the program on our computer, we can then download and install the software and run it for the first time.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-29">System requirements</h2>
<p class="normal">To run Clip <a id="_idIndexMarker031"/>Studio Paint<a id="_idIndexMarker032"/> effectively, our computer must meet certain system requirements. These requirements are slightly different for PCs than for Macs, so please check the system requirements carefully against the computer that you will be installing the software on to ensure that Clip Studio Paint will run properly.</p>
<p class="normal">Both PC and Mac computers have the following requirements for use of the program:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Storage space</strong>: At least 3 GB of storage space available on the hard drive.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Monitor</strong>: XGA (1,024 x 768) or higher, and high color (16-bit, 65,536 colors) or higher required.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Internet access</strong>: An internet connection<a id="_idIndexMarker033"/> will be necessary<a id="_idIndexMarker034"/> for license authentication.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-30">Windows system requirements</h2>
<p class="normal">The following are <a id="_idIndexMarker035"/>the requirements<a id="_idIndexMarker036"/> to run Clip Studio Paint version 2 on Windows:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Operating system</strong>:<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Microsoft Windows English operating system</li>

<li class="bulletList">GPUs compatible with OpenGL 2.1.</li>
<li class="bulletList">2 GB of memory or more is required; 8 GB or more is recommended.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Important note</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Memory space and CPU capability are required for top software performance regarding the image size, number of layers, and so on. Generally, the larger the image size and the number of layers, the more memory and the faster the CPU required.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Tablet</strong>:<ul>
<li class="bulletList">Tablets compatible with the Windows Ink platform.</li>
<li class="bulletList">A pen tablet or tablet monitor that supports a pressure-sensitive stylus (compatible with Wintab).</li>
<li class="bulletList">WACOM, XPPen, and Huion devices are recommended as tablets <a id="_idIndexMarker037"/>compatible<a id="_idIndexMarker038"/> with Wintab.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-31">macOS requirements</h2>
<p class="normal">If you are using<a id="_idIndexMarker039"/> a macOS<a id="_idIndexMarker040"/> computer, you will need to meet the following system requirements to run Clip Studio Paint version 3:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Operating system</strong>:<ul>

<li class="bulletList">GPUs compatible with OpenGL 2.1.</li>
<li class="bulletList">2 GB of memory or more is required; 8 GB or more is recommended.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">We’ll go into tablets in more detail in the <em class="italic">About graphics tablets</em> section. If your computer system meets or exceeds the requirements listed, then it’s time to install the program!</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-32">Installing the program</h2>
<p class="normal">To purchase and <a id="_idIndexMarker041"/>download the Clip Studio Paint program, you will need an internet connection. The program is available through the Clip Studio website. To access the English version of the website, you will need to visit the URL <a href="http://www.clipstudio.net/en">http://www.clipstudio.net/en</a> in your internet browser.</p>
<p class="normal">Clip Studio does have a free trial of the program, which is very handy if you want to try the program to make sure your computer system can run it, or if you want to explore the program and ensure that it will meet your needs before buying it. At the time of writing, the Clip Studio Paint free trial lasts for up to 3 months on most devices, and 6 months on Galaxy. You can try both the Clip Studio Paint Pro and Clip Studio Paint EX versions of the program. Also, when using the trial version of the software, you will need to register for a free Clip Studio account.</p>
<p class="normal">We will discuss the Clip<a id="_idIndexMarker042"/> Studio<a id="_idIndexMarker043"/> account further in <em class="italic">Chapter 18</em>, <em class="italic">Exploring the Clip Studio Assets and Animation</em>.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Important note</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Clip Studio Paint Pro or Clip Studio Paint EX? Which version should you choose? There are very few differences<a id="_idIndexMarker044"/> between the Pro and EX versions of the software. The Pro version is the standard version, and EX is the full-featured version. Clip Studio Paint Pro is less expensive than the EX version. The biggest difference between the two versions of the program is that the EX version allows you to create multi-page files (files with multiple pages in them that can be viewed and edited all at once) and that the EX version has no limit regarding the number of animation frames in a file, while the Pro version limits animation frames to a total of 24. If you will be creating long animations, chapters of a comic or manga, or other works where viewing multiple pages is needed, it is highly recommended to get the EX version of Clip Studio Paint.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-33">Downloading the trial version</h2>
<p class="normal">Once we’re <a id="_idIndexMarker045"/>on the Clip Studio website, we’ll need to download the trial version or buy the software. To download the trial version, complete the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">On the <a href="http://ClipStudio.net/en">ClipStudio.net/en</a> website, click on the green button labeled <strong class="screenText">Free Trial</strong>.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Choose the version of the software compatible with your operating system (Windows or macOS) and click on the corresponding <strong class="screenText">Download Trial</strong> button.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click <strong class="screenText">Sign up to get your first 3 months free </strong>for Windows and mac OS<strong class="screenText"> </strong>if you haven’t signed up yet, or log in with your Clip Studio account if you already have one.</li>
<li class="numberedList">On the next window, click <strong class="screenText">Get 30 days free! </strong>to register your Clip Studio account and get 30 days free. Click <strong class="screenText">3 month free trial</strong> to get 3 months free when you apply for a monthly plan.</li>
<li class="numberedList">The program installation file will be<a id="_idIndexMarker046"/> saved to your computer.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-34">Purchasing Clip Studio Paint</h2>
<p class="normal">Clip Studio offers two different types<a id="_idIndexMarker047"/> of purchase: One-time purchase and Annual/Monthly plans. One-time purchase means, as the name says, you only pay once to use Clip Studio, and Annual/Monthly plans mean you can choose to either pay once a year or monthly to use Clip Studio. Let’s have a look at the following chart to get to know the difference and see which is the best option for you!</p>

<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-37">Starting the program for the first time</h2>
<p class="normal">Now that we <a id="_idIndexMarker065"/>have the program installed, we’re ready to launch it for the first time. On the initial launch, you will have the opportunity to download additional materials, such as new brushes, patterns, and 3D models. Enter and verify your serial number, or register to use the trial version. This is the last step before we can open the Clip Studio Paint<a id="_idIndexMarker066"/> program and begin exploring the interface, so let’s get started.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-38">Changing a license</h2>
<p class="normal">There are a<a id="_idIndexMarker067"/> few cases where the license may need to be changed:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">When changing from the trial version to the purchased version</li>
<li class="bulletList">Upgrading the software from the Pro version to the EX version</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Launch the Clip Studio Paint software.</li>
<li class="numberedList">From the <strong class="screenText">Help</strong> menu, select the <strong class="screenText">Register/Change License…</strong> option (or the Clip Studio Paint menu in macOS).</li>

<li class="numberedList">Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the license registration and click <strong class="screenText">Launch</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-39">Downloading additional materials</h2>
<p class="normal">The additional <a id="_idIndexMarker068"/>materials you can download inclue many extra tools, patterns, or models that go beyond basic tools. If they were not downloaded during the initial registration of the program, they can be downloaded later by using the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Launch the Clip Studio application by double-clicking the icon.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Once Clip Studio is open, click on the settings menu (the gear icon) in the top-right-hand corner.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click <strong class="screenText">Download additional materials now </strong>from the menu.</li>
<li class="numberedList">When the download confirmation message is displayed, click <strong class="screenText">Yes</strong> to begin the download. Depending on the size of the materials, this download may take several minutes.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">Once we install the program, we need to have a tool to draw on the program! Let’s start finding<a id="_idIndexMarker069"/> out what we use to create art in Clip Studio Paint.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-40">About graphics tablets</h1>
<p class="normal">When working with <a id="_idIndexMarker070"/>art software such as Clip Studio Paint, having<a id="_idIndexMarker071"/> a graphics tablet makes life a lot easier. So, what is a graphics tablet, and where can you obtain one?</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-41">What is a graphics tablet?</h2>
<p class="normal">A graphics tablet is a computer peripheral that comes with a stylus. It allows you to hold a stylus and draw the way that you would with a pencil or pen on paper. The following diagram on the right illustrates a basic tablet and stylus:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A drawing of a tablet and a pencil  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_02_2.10.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.10: A graphics tablet</p>
<p class="normal">There are many different types and brands of graphics tablets, all ranging in price from under $100 to over $2,500, so it is easy to find a tablet that is within your budget. I cannot express enough how much easier working in Clip Studio Paint is when you have a tablet!</p>
<p class="normal">There are many different factors to consider when shopping for a graphics tablet. Let’s<a id="_idIndexMarker072"/> break <a id="_idIndexMarker073"/>some of those options down so that you can make a good choice when purchasing your tablet.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-42">What type of tablet should I buy?</h2>
<p class="normal">There are two <a id="_idIndexMarker074"/>primary types of tablets: traditional tablets and monitor tablets. Traditional tablets are slates that plug into or connect wirelessly to your computer. You then use the stylus to draw on the tablet while looking at the separate monitor, just like using a mouse on a computer.</p>
<p class="normal">A monitor tablet is a tablet with a monitor screen built into it. You then use the stylus directly on the screen so that you can see your hand and what you’re drawing at the same time. This method feels more like using traditional paper and pencil and requires less of an adjustment period for new tablet users, as there is less of a disconnect between what your hand does and what your eyes see. A traditional tablet is fantastic for painting, but for detailed drawings that require accuracy, such as inking, a monitor tablet plays a great role.</p>
<p class="normal">However, this comes at a price. Monitor tablets are becoming more affordable every year, but they are still much more expensive than traditional tablets. If you are purchasing a tablet for a young artist or are someone just getting into digital art, I always recommend getting a traditional tablet. They are far more affordable and usually easy to find second-hand, but still in good working order. For more established artists who do a lot of art and know for certain that they like working digitally, investing in a larger tablet or a tablet monitor will usually speed up your workflow and make life easier, so it makes sense to invest in a higher-end tablet.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-43">How large of a tablet should I buy?</h2>
<p class="normal">Tablets come in<a id="_idIndexMarker075"/> all sizes, from no bigger than a traditional mouse pad to the size of a tabletop. The size of the tablet that you buy is very much dependent on how you draw. Sit down and draw on a piece of regular paper, and try to pay attention to how large or small you draw. You’ll need to figure that out before you can decide on the size of the tablet you want to buy!</p>
<p class="normal">Another thing to consider when looking at different sizes of tablets is the space you have to store them. If you are using a tablet with your laptop and will be traveling with it often, or if you have only a small amount of space on your desk, you will want to purchase a smaller tablet that is more easily transported. However, if you have a larger area or will only be using the tablet at a desk, a larger tablet could be the right fit for you. I find that people who draw small can be comfortable with a small tablet size. Personally, I draw rather large and tend to take up the whole sheet of paper when I draw, so I like a larger tablet when I work because it gives me more room to work with.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-44">What tablet brand should I buy?</h2>
<p class="normal">There is a wide <a id="_idIndexMarker076"/>selection of tablets available, all with their own pros and cons. Some of the most well-known of these tablet brands are Wacom, XPPen, and Huion. Each brand has a wide range of different-sized and priced tablets, most of which you can find on their websites or by searching for them on sites such as Amazon.</p>
<p class="normal">I often get asked what brand of tablet I would recommend, and for me, there is one clear winner: Wacom. From my personal experience, Wacom tablets are of the highest quality and last the longest.</p>
<p class="normal">It’s always good to know which models are great for your budget. The following is a list of Wacom, Huion, and XPPen recommendation models, organized by price range:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">50–199 USD range</strong>: Wacom Intuos Medium, HUION HS610, and XPPen Artist 12 Pro 11.6”</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">200–300 USD</strong>: Wacom Intuos 5 Touch Medium, HUION Kamvas Pro 16, and XP Pen Artist 15.6</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">+400 USD</strong>: Wacom Cintiq 13 HD, HUION Kamvas Pro 16 2.5k, and XP Pen Artist 22R Pro</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">You can often find them used on eBay and Amazon as well, so with a bit of searching, you should be able to find a tablet for any budget.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Important note</strong></p>
<p class="normal">The Clip Studio Paint iPad version is as good as the computer version. But please remember that purchasing Clip Studio Paint on a computer doesn’t mean you can use the iPad, iPhone, Galaxy, and Android versions for free. You need to pay the monthly fee for these versions, regardless of whether you already have Clip Studio Paint on your computer.

<p class="normal">Now that we have <a id="_idIndexMarker077"/>Clip Studio Paint installed and chosen our graphics tablet, it’s time to start getting to know this amazing art software.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-45">Taking a look at the default interface</h1>
<p class="normal">Once you launch <a id="_idIndexMarker078"/>Clip Studio Paint, you will be<a id="_idIndexMarker079"/> greeted by the default interface. New users often get to the default interface and panic. It can be a bit overwhelming at first, but I promise it’s not so scary! With a little bit of exploration, we can break down the default interface and understand what each section is. In the next section, we’ll even learn how to customize the interface to suit our own needs. But for now, let’s take a look at the default user interface.</p>
<p class="normal">The following screenshot shows what you may see when starting up your program for the first time:</p>

<li class="numberedList" value="2">The <strong class="screenText">t</strong><strong class="screenText">ool palette</strong> holds all of the various tools that we’ll use to create our comics and illustrations. At the top of the <strong class="screenText">tool palette</strong> are tools such as <strong class="screenText">Zoom</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Move</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Move layer</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Selection</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Auto select</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Eyedropper</strong>.

<li class="numberedList" value="3">The <strong class="screenText">Quick Access</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Material palettes</strong>, shown on the left, have a lot going on, but they are an extremely <a id="_idIndexMarker084"/>useful <a id="_idIndexMarker085"/>part of the Clip Studio Paint software. The Quick Access palette gives us access to more frequently used actions, much like the command bar. The Quick Access palette can also be customized, but unlike the command bar, it has two sets inside of it. This allows more flexibility, as Set 1 could be used for functions such as save and undo, while Set 2 could be set up with the most widely used tools or other commands to make tasks like coloring easier. We’ll explore the Quick Access palette in more depth in <em class="italic">Chapter 5</em>, <em class="italic">Pages and Panels to Shape Manga</em>. This part of the software also contains the <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> palette, shown right. Materials can be everything from comic frame templates, word balloons, and photographs to special brush designs and 3D models. There’s a huge variety of items contained in the Material palette. We’ll learn more about 3D models in <em class="italic">Chapter 14</em>, <em class="italic">Using 3D Figures and Objects</em>, and more about the<a id="_idIndexMarker086"/> Material <a id="_idIndexMarker087"/>palette in <em class="italic">Chapter 9</em>, <em class="italic">Inking Special Effects and the Material Palette</em>.</li>

<p class="normal">Now that we have a better grasp of the default parts of the interface, we can learn how to move <a id="_idIndexMarker098"/>elements of the program <a id="_idIndexMarker099"/>around and customize it to suit our needs. Read on to learn more!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-46">Moving, collapsing, and closing palettes</h1>
<p class="normal">One of my favorite things about Clip Studio Paint is how customizable it is. We can customize not only our tools but also the interface of the program to make it look however we want it to look. This means that we can set up the program palettes and toolbars to give us the most efficient workflow, making our process as streamlined as possible. The process of moving, closing, and rearranging palettes is very easy, so let’s get right to it.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-47">Moving a palette</h2>
<p class="normal">Let’s start off by <a id="_idIndexMarker100"/>moving a palette to a new <a id="_idIndexMarker101"/>location in the Clip Studio Paint interface. I’ll be working with the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette in this example, but this can be done with any palette you choose. Follow these steps to move a palette:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Locate the palette to be moved.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Put the mouse cursor over the name on the tab of the palette. The tab will be highlighted in blue when the mouse cursor is in the correct position.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Hold down the left mouse button to grab the palette, and then move the mouse to drag the palette out of its position. The palette’s new location will be shown in red, as shown in the screenshot on the right:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_02_2.24.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.24 :Screenshot of the palette location</p>
<p class="normal">Drag the palette to the new desired location. A red line will appear when the palette is in line to be dropped in a new place in the interface, as shown by the red line below the <strong class="screenText">Layer Property</strong> palette in the following screenshot:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_02_2.25.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.25: Screenshot of the palette location 2</p>
<p class="normal">When the palette<a id="_idIndexMarker102"/> is in the desired new location, release <a id="_idIndexMarker103"/>the left mouse button to finish moving the palette. In the following screenshot, the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette is now below the <strong class="screenText">Layer Property</strong> palette:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_02_2.26.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.26: Screenshot of the palette location 3</p>
<p class="normal">A palette can also be <a id="_idIndexMarker104"/>popped out of the interface, by <a id="_idIndexMarker105"/>dragging the palette out to the canvas display window and releasing it when it is surrounded by a red rectangle. This will place the palette out on its own and not as part of the sidebars of the interface, as shown in the screenshot on the right:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_02_2.27.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.27: Screenshot of the palette location 4</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-48">Closing a palette</h2>
<p class="normal">There are two <a id="_idIndexMarker106"/>ways<a id="_idIndexMarker107"/> to close a palette that isn’t needed. Follow these simple steps to close a palette:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Follow the preceding instructions to move a palette, and make sure to <em class="italic">pop out</em> the palette, as shown in <em class="italic">step 6</em>.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on the <strong class="screenText">X</strong> button in the upper-right-hand corner of the palette to close it.</li>
<li class="numberedList">To retrieve a palette once it’s been closed, simply go to <strong class="screenText">Window</strong> in the <strong class="screenText">File</strong><strong class="keyWord"> </strong>menu. Click on the name of the palette to show it again. Alternatively, the <strong class="screenText">Window</strong> menu can also be used to close palettes by clicking on the names with checkmarks next to them.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-49">Collapsing and expanding palettes</h2>
<p class="normal">Clip Studio <a id="_idIndexMarker108"/>Paint<a id="_idIndexMarker109"/> can also temporarily hide entire banks of palettes and then retrieve them when needed. In the screenshot on the right, the <strong class="screenText">Quick Access</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> palettes are collapsed so that we can only see the category icons:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_02_2.28.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.28: Screenshot of the Quick Access and Material palettes</p>
<p class="normal">Let’s learn how to<a id="_idIndexMarker110"/> expand and <a id="_idIndexMarker111"/>collapse these palettes by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">To fully expand the palette, click on the single right-facing arrow at the top of the palette window. The palette will expand, as shown in the screenshot on the right:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_02_2.29.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.29: Screenshot of an expanded palette</p>
<p class="normal-one">To collapse<a id="_idIndexMarker112"/> the palette<a id="_idIndexMarker113"/> back down to icons only, click on the single left-facing arrow at the top of the palette.</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="2">To fully collapse the palette, click on the double left-facing arrows at the top of the palette.</li>
</ol>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Remember that palettes on the right-hand side of the screen will have arrows facing the opposite direction, but they still perform the same function! They just collapse the palettes to the right instead of to the left. Collapsing palettes is a great way to give yourself more drawing space when on a small monitor, so be sure to use this if the interface feels cramped and you want to temporarily move things out <a id="_idIndexMarker114"/>of the way <a id="_idIndexMarker115"/>while creating your art!</p>
</div>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-50">The tool palette and command bar</h1>
<p class="normal">Now that we’ve <a id="_idIndexMarker116"/>explored how to move palettes around, let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker117"/>discuss the tool palette and command bar in more detail. Both of these parts of the Clip Studio Paint interface are very important, and you’ll use them often, so let’s get to know them before we start drawing.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-51">The tool palette</h2>
<p class="normal">The tool palette<a id="_idIndexMarker118"/> is found in the default interface down the left-hand side of the program. This is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="normal">The tool palette <a id="_idIndexMarker119"/>gives us access to the various drawing and editing tools in Clip Studio Paint. The tools are separated into categories, designated by the horizontal lines going across the tool palette, and are divided into thirds.</p>
<p class="normal">In the top third of the tool palette are the selection and editing tools. From top to bottom, they are listed in the following order with the corresponding shortcut keys in brackets:</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="img/1.png"/></p>
<p class="normal">The very bottom of the tool palette shows the current foreground and background colors, as well as a transparent <em class="italic">color</em> that can be selected to allow mark-making tools to act like erasers. More information on this is in <em class="italic">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="italic">Erasers, Selections, and the Sub View Palette</em>.</p>
<p class="normal">It is best to think of the tool palette as a collection of categories of tools. Clicking on one of the icons in the tool palette will change the options available in the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> palette. The desired tool is then selected from the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> palette. You can think of the tool palette as drawers holding supplies in each one. For instance, if we click on the pencil in the tool palette, it is like opening a drawer where all of our pencils are stored. Then, we can select the specific pencil we want out of that category of pencils. It is always good to have the tool palette and <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> palette<a id="_idIndexMarker120"/> open near each other to make tool selection quick and easy.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-52">Customizing the tool palette</h2>
<p class="normal">Just like all the<a id="_idIndexMarker121"/> other parts of the Clip Studio Paint interface, the tool palette can be customized to suit our needs. Let’s take a look at the different options we have to customize the toolbar.</p>
<h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-53">Reordering tools</h3>
<p class="normal">Just like the palettes<a id="_idIndexMarker122"/> of the interface, the tools in the toolbar can be moved around to suit our individual needs. For the following instructions, let’s move the Pencil tool up above the Zoom tool so that it is the first tool in the tool palette. Accomplish this by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Click on the icon of the tool in the tool palette to be moved and hold down the left mouse button.</li>
<li class="numberedList">While holding down the button, drag the tool icon to the new location. A red line will show the current position.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Once the red line is in the new, desired place, release the mouse button.</li>
<li class="numberedList">To put the tool icon back in its previous place, repeat the preceding steps to move it <a id="_idIndexMarker123"/>again.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-54">Renaming tools</h3>
<p class="normal">Any of the tools in <a id="_idIndexMarker124"/>the tool palette can be renamed. To do this, complete the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Locate the icon of the tool to be renamed in the palette.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Right-click with the mouse on the icon to bring up the menu shown in the screenshot on the right:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_02_2.31.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.31: Screenshot of renaming tools 1</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="3">Select <strong class="screenText">Tool settings…</strong> from the menu. The following dialog box will appear:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_02_2.32.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.32: Screenshot of renaming tools 2</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="4">In the text entry field, type in a new name for the tool.</li>
<li class="numberedList">To accept the name change, click <strong class="screenText">OK</strong>. If you change your mind and don’t wish <a id="_idIndexMarker125"/>to rename the tool, click <strong class="screenText">Cancel</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="heading-3" id="_idParaDest-55">Deleting tools</h3>
<p class="normal">Sometimes, you just <a id="_idIndexMarker126"/>don’t use a certain category of tools, and you don’t want them cluttering up your space. With Clip Studio Paint, we can get rid of some of the visual clutter and delete tools that we don’t use from the tool palette. Use the following steps to delete a tool and all of its sub tools:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Locate the icon of the tool to be deleted in the tool palette.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Right-click on the icon to bring up the menu shown in <em class="italic">step 2</em> of the <em class="italic">Renaming tools</em> section.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Select <strong class="screenText">Delete tool…</strong> from the menu. The following message will appear:</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_02_2.33.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.33: Screenshot of deleting tools</p>
<p class="normal">To proceed to delete the tool and all of its sub tools, click <strong class="screenText">OK</strong>. If we’ve changed our mind and want to leave the tool icon in the tool palette, we can simply click <strong class="screenText">Cancel</strong>.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">If you accidentally delete an important default tool from the tool palette and need to get it back, all of the default sub tools are available from the tool palette menu. Click the top-left icon of the palette and select <strong class="screenText">Add from default…</strong> from the drop-down menu. Select the tool you want to add to the tool palette from the list and select <strong class="screenText">OK</strong>. Ta da! The deleted tool is now back on the tool palette!</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Now that we know all about customizing the tool palette, let’s take a minute to talk about the <a id="_idIndexMarker127"/>command bar.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-56">The primary command bar</h2>
<p class="normal">The primary<a id="_idIndexMarker128"/> or permanent command bar is located between the <strong class="keyWord">File</strong> menu and the canvas display area. It is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="normal">The default options on the command bar in the preceding screenshot are as follows, from left to right:</p>
<p class="center"><img alt="" src="img/2.png"/></p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-57">Summary</h1>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, you learned how to obtain Clip Studio Paint and install it. You are now familiar with the default interface, can move, close, and temporarily collapse menus and palettes, and know how to reorder tools in the tool palette. We also took a closer look at the command bar in the main menu and the selection launcher.</p>
<p class="normal">In the next chapter, we are going to take a look at the program’s preferences before we get into our actual drawings.
