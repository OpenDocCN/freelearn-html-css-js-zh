<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Preface</h1>
<p>This book is about crafting, understanding, and maintaining JavaScript frameworks – the critical building blocks of many modern web applications. The ecosystem of software frameworks, particularly JavaScript ones, has been highly interesting for many developers in the past 10-plus years. In addition, JavaScript has been arguably the most influential and ubiquitous programming language, enabling millions of critical web applications and services. Powered by the vibrant community of developers and innovative companies, the development of JavaScript frameworks has since emerged as a dynamic and exciting space, with opportunities for innovation and exploration. Each new framework brings its own philosophy and approach, representing a unique set of solutions to common web application and web services challenges.</p>
<p>It is important to note that this book is not solely for those planning to develop their JavaScript frameworks from scratch. While it provides valuable wisdom in creating a well-maintained system, its primary goal extends beyond that. It is also designed to refine your understanding of frameworks operating under the hood, refining your JavaScript or software developer skills. It encourages you to think from a framework’s perspective, thus fostering a more profound comprehension of reusable software architectures. Whether you’re an experienced developer looking to delve deeper into your toolkit or a newcomer seeking to understand the framework landscape, this book will be advantageous to your career.</p>
