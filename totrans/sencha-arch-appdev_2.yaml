- en: '**Model-View-Controller** (**MVC**) is a software architecture pattern, which
    separates the representation of the information from the user''s interaction with
    it. The model represents the application data, the view represents the output
    of the representation of the data (a form, grid, chart), and the controller mediates
    the input, converting it to commands for the model or view.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ext JS and Sencha Touch use a **Model-View-Controller-Store** (**MVCS**) pattern.
    The model is a representation of the data we want to manipulate in our application
    (a representation of a table from the database). The view contains all the components
    and screens we create to manage the information of a model. As Ext JS is event
    driven, all the views fire events when the user interacts with them, and the controller
    will capture these events and will do something, redirecting the command to the
    model (or store) or the view. The store in Ext JS is very similar to the **Data
    Access Object** (**DAO**) pattern used on the server side.

- en: 'For a quick example, let''s say we have **WidgetA**, which is a grid panel
    that displays all the records from the table A. **ModelA** represents this table.
    The **StoreA** table is responsible for retrieving the information (collection
    of **ModelA** from the server). When the user clicks on a record from **WidgetA**,
    a window will be opened (called **WidgetB**) that displays information from the
    table B (represented by **ModelB**). And of course, the **StoreB** will be responsible
    for retrieving the collection of **ModelB** from server. In this case, we will
    have **ControllerA** to capture the click event from **WidgetA** and do all the
    required logic to display **WidgetB** and load all the **ModelB** information.
    If we try to put this in a quick reference diagram, it would look something like

    of the server-side code `php` folder).

- en: It is very important to bring to our attention that we cannot modify the files
    on a code editor. In case we do modify any files and try to open them on Sencha
    Architect again, all changes will be lost because Sencha Architect will override
    them. So, in case you decide you want to change any file on a code editor, it
    is important to know that you will not be able to use Sencha Architect again (and
    if you do, you will lose the modifications).

- en: In this chapter, we learned how to implement our first Ext JS project using
    Sencha Architect. We learned how to create a new Ext JS project and set up the
    `app.js` file using the application. We learned how to create models, stores,
    views, and controller, and how to reuse a component by linking it to another component.
    We have also learned how to test a store to see if the information is being loaded
    from the server correctly and how to configure the project settings to execute
    it for the first time.
