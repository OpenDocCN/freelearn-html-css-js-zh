    for us to become familiar with the core components. However, it is not possible
    to go through all the configurations within the book. In this chapter, we will
    explore the functional properties that are most used and demonstrate them with
    examples. We will learn how Highcharts manages layout, and then explore how to
    configure axes, specify single series and multiple series data, followed by looking
    at formatting and styling tool tips in both JavaScript and HTML. After that, we
    will get to know how to polish our charts with various types of animations and
    apply color gradients. Finally, we will explore the `drilldown` interactive feature.
    In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:'

    effect on the overall layout. Chart margins can be configured with the properties
    `margin`, `marginTop`, `marginLeft`, `marginRight`, and `marginBottom`, and they
    are not enabled by default. Setting chart margins has a global effect on the plot
    area, so that none of the label positions or chart spacing configurations can
    affect the plot area size. Hence, all the chart elements are in a fixed layout
    mode with respect to the plot area. The `margin` option is an array of four margin
    values covered for each direction, the same as in CSS, starting from north and
    going clockwise. Also, the `margin` option has a lower precedence than any of
    the directional `margin` options, regardless of their order in the `chart` section.

    the container border. It also changes the top border into fixed layout for any
    label elements, so the chart title and subtitle float on top of the plot area.
    The `spacingLeft` property increases the spacing area on the left-hand side, so
    it pushes the *y* axis title further in. As it is in automatic layout (without
    declaring `marginLeft`), it also pushes the plot area's west border in. Setting
    `marginRight` to `0` will override all the default spacing on the chart's right-hand
    side and change it to fixed layout mode. Finally, setting `spacingBottom` to `0`
    makes the legend touch the lower bar of the container, so it also stretches the
    plot area downwards. This is because the bottom edge is still in automatic layout
    even though `spacingBottom` is set to `0`.

    has its own purpose in the automatic layout. Spacing is for the gap between the
    container and the chart content; thus, if we want to display a chart nicely spaced
    with other elements on a web page, spacing elements should be used. Equally, if
    we want to use a specific font size for the label elements, we should consider
    adjusting the `y` offset. Hence, the labels are still maintained at a distance
    and do not interfere with other components in the chart.

    of 15 pixels in height when applied to the chart. This means that there should
    be a gap between the title and the container bottom border, but none is shown.
    This is because the `title.y` position has a default value of 15 pixels in relation
    to spacing. According to the diagram in the *Chart label properties* section,
    this positive `y` value pushes the title towards the bottom border; this compensates
    for the space created by `spacingBottom`.

    true`), is for the volume trade. In the series array, the first and second series
    are specified as column series types (`type: ''column''`), which override the
    default series type `''line''`. Then the `stacking` option is defined as `''normal''`
    in `plotOptions.column`, which stacks the monthly high on top of the monthly low
    column (deep blue and black columns). Strictly speaking, the stacked column chart
    is used for displaying the ratio of data belonging to the same category. For the
    sake of demonstrating `plotOptions`, we used the stacked column chart to show
    the upper and lower ends of monthly trade. To do that, we take the difference
    between monthly high and monthly low and substitute the differences back into
    the monthly high series. So in the code, we can see that the data values in the

- en: The preceding donut chart is slightly misleading because the total value of
    all the data labels is 9 percent, but the presentation of the donut chart gives
    the impression of 100 percent in total. In order to clarify that 9 percent is
    the total value, we can take advantage of the Highcharts Renderer engine (we will
    explore this further in [Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Pie Charts"), *Pie Charts*)
    to display an SVG text box in the middle of the ring. However, the `drilldown`
    option only allows us to declare series-specific options. Moreover, we would like
    the 9 percent text box to appear only when clicking on the 'Internet Explorer'
    column.

    further in [Chapter 11](ch11.html "Chapter 11. Highcharts Events"), *Highcharts
    Events*. Here, we use the events specific to the `drilldown` action. The basic
    idea is that, when the `drilldown` event is triggered, we check the data point
    being clicked is **Internet Explorer**. If so, then we create a textbox using
    the chart''s renderer engine. In the `drillup` event (triggered when the **Back
    to …** button is clicked), we remove the text box if it exists:'

    with, and examples shown. By now, we should be comfortable with what we have covered
    already and ready to plot some of the basic graphs with more elaborate styles.

    by Highcharts. We will apply configurations that we have learned in this chapter
    and explore the series-specific style options to plot charts in an artistic style.
