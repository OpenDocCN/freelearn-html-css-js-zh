			<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, I taught courses where I had students in-person and online. When there was a spike in cases, all the students had to learn from home for a month. One of my students was apprehensive because of their poor online learning experience earlier in the pandemic.</p>
			<p>However, when I reached out to this student a week into our online teaching, they cheerfully responded that my class felt no different, online or in-person. During a new term with students both online and in-person, several of my in-person students chose to attend online for the same reasons. These interactions with my students constantly reinforce my beliefs that online learning can be as effective as in-person learning, when the right tools are used.</p>
			<p>The previous chapter outlined the various features within Google Meet. As with any tool, its effectiveness is reliant on the knowledge and experience of the wielder. Google Meet provides the means to teach online with Google Classroom; however, teaching virtually is a completely different paradigm than teaching in person. While some of the principles are similar, there are several considerations that are unique to teaching in an online environment. Since you (or your school) have already committed dollars to purchasing this book, I hesitate recommending even more things to purchase.</p>
			<p>However, there are many qualities of effective in-person teaching that do not transfer easily to online teaching, without some additional equipment being required. Once the quality of the online content is the best it can be, additional suggestions will be provided for the class' structure. In this chapter, you will explore strategies that can improve the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The audio quality of your presentations</li>
				<li>The video quality of your presentations</li>
				<li>Pedagogical strategies for online classes</li>
				<li>Content organization within Google Classroom</li>
				<li>Online assessment practices</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-144"><a id="_idTextAnchor144"/>Plug into the internet</h1>
			<p>If your school demographic is like mine, the majority of teachers and students have laptops at home. Fewer and fewer households have desktop computers at home. (Don't worry, I'm not about to recommend that you purchase a brand-new computer.) With more laptops than desktops at home, another common trend is to use Wi-Fi to connect computers to the internet. However, because <a id="_idIndexMarker579"/>Wi-Fi does not use a physical connection, it is susceptible to interference.</p>
			<p>This interference can lead to slower connections and even lost signals. Furthermore, the more devices that are connected to the internet through Wi-Fi, the more each device has to share the data rate of the Wi-Fi signal. Therefore, to ensure that you have a more stable connection to the internet, you should connect your computer to the internet through a physical connection. Most internet service providers loan out internet routers, which have Ethernet ports in the back to physically connect devices:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.1 – Ethernet port and cable</p>
			<p>Use an Ethernet cable to connect your computer directly to the router. If your computer does not have an Ethernet port, you can purchase a USB-to-Ethernet adapter at your local electronics store. Connecting your computer to the internet with a cable can improve internet speeds up to 10 times compared to using Wi-Fi. With a stable and fast connection, students will be able to see and hear you better. In the next section, we'll explore additional audio and video techniques and hardware that can help make you look and sound your best.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-145"><a id="_idTextAnchor145"/>Looking your best in Google Meet</h1>
			<p>In the internet era, your <a id="_idIndexMarker580"/>students will know quality video from amateur video. Furthermore, human brains can figure out when something isn't quite natural, such as when a movie scene contains uncanny CGI graphics. Even if your students cannot identify what is wrong, having poor quality audio and video will disrupt the flow of your teaching and learning.</p>
			<p>Even worse, constant disruption to the lesson, whether in-person or online, will lead to many students becoming disinterested and distracted. During in-person classes, being presentable is only a matter of dressing appropriately. Yet being on camera requires that you use cameras, lighting, and microphones to achieve the same effect.</p>
			<p>Some of you may already be thinking, <em class="italic">students know that we are not professionals in videography</em>, which is true. However, we meticulously shape our in-person classrooms to reduce distraction, promote creativity, and focus our students' attention. Doesn't improving our online delivery of content fall under all those categories too?</p>
			<p>If your answer to this question is yes, then continue reading! In the following subsections, we explore strategies that can help improve how you look and sound. But before we look at lights and cameras, let's start with a good microphone.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-146"><a id="_idTextAnchor146"/>How you sound is more important than how you look</h2>
			<p>George Lucas is famously <a id="_idIndexMarker581"/>quoted for saying that sound and music are 50% of the entertainment in a movie. Oftentimes, it is easier to watch a low-quality video with crisp audio rather than a high-quality video with crackly audio. Therefore, using a good quality microphone is more important (and thankfully cheaper) than using a good quality camera. If you are using a laptop or webcam, built-in microphones can work, but they do not provide quality sound.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">What is quality sound?</p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="bold">Quality sound</strong> means that the <a id="_idIndexMarker582"/>microphone is only receiving your voice and is making it sound natural. If the microphone picks up keyboard typing, room echo, heavily processes your voice, or has a background hiss, it will be hard for your students to listen for long periods.</p>
			<p>One way of improving audio is to have whatever microphone you use closer to your mouth. Ideally, it should be 3 to 6 inches from your mouth and at a 45-degree angle. This position ensures that the microphone is close enough to you that it picks up your voice louder than other things, such as your keyboard, while also preventing you from blowing air into the mic when you're saying <em class="italic">P</em> and <em class="italic">T</em> words:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer519" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.2_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 11.2 – Microphone placement&#13;&#10;" width="271" height="268"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.2 – Microphone placement</p>
			<p>If you are using a <a id="_idIndexMarker583"/>laptop, where the microphone is often directly above the screen, a simple way of improving its sound is to raise the laptop using a laptop stand or a stack of books. Another cost-free method you can try is using pre-existing smartphone headsets or earbuds. You can plug them into your computer's headphone jack or wirelessly connect them using Bluetooth.</p>
			<h3>Purchasing a microphone</h3>
			<p>If you want to <a id="_idIndexMarker584"/>purchase a microphone, the Logitech Blue Yeti or Audio Technica ATR2100X-USB are common, high-quality USB microphones that cost around $100 USD. Another cheaper alternative is the Samson Go Mic, which is around $50 USD, but it needs to be clipped to the top of a laptop or monitor or onto a stand.</p>
			<p>At the other end, the Shure MV7, which is priced at around $250 USD, offers great sound quality. All these microphones can be plugged in through your computer's USB port and will be automatically detected by your computer.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important</p>
			<p class="callout">Whenever you're using an external microphone, make sure that it has been selected in Google Meet.</p>
			<p>Another quality-of-life purchase is a boom arm for the microphone. Boom arms attach to the side of the desk and raise the microphone so that it's closer to your mouth. It also frees up desk space as it can be attached to the side of the desk. A budget alternative is to place the microphone on a stack of books.</p>
			<p>Don't be afraid to <a id="_idIndexMarker585"/>experiment with your students when it comes to which microphones sound better than others. While they may not be able to tell you why they prefer one microphone over another, they will be able to tell a difference and identify which one they like best. Now that we've covered audio, let's look at video.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-147"><a id="_idTextAnchor147"/>Lights! Camera! Action!</h2>
			<p>As with audio quality, there are <a id="_idIndexMarker586"/>many factors that affect how well you appear to your students. In videography, the main factor that affects quality is proper lighting. Before we discuss webcams and alternative devices, we should talk about lighting. Having proper light placement can improve your video quality in the same way as having proper microphone placement can improve your audio. (And it can be free!) When you're choosing a place to sit, find a location where there is a large window to the left or right of where you are sitting:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer520" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.3_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 11.3 – Sitting beside a large sunlit window&#13;&#10;" width="481" height="539"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.3 – Sitting beside a large sunlit window</p>
			<p>In the previous chapter, you can see the blinds of my window directly to my right in many of the images provided.</p>
			<p>Some of the common <a id="_idIndexMarker587"/>mistakes that people make when it comes to finding good lighting include placing the window directly behind or directly in front of them. In these cases, the light can either make your face too bright or make the background too bright. Both will result in reduced visibility, as shown in the following image:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer521" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.4_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 11.4 – Too many background and foreground light effects&#13;&#10;" width="1180" height="392"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.4 – Too many background and foreground light effects</p>
			<p>If your teaching space does not have a large window or if you are teaching an evening course, you will need to use another light source. Despite point-and-shoot cameras and smartphones having the camera flash pointing directly at the object being photographed, as we mentioned in the previous paragraph, having a light source directly in front of your face will create an unnatural look. To mimic the lighting that comes through a large window, the light source must create diffuse light at or slightly above eye level.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">What is diffuse light?</p>
			<p class="callout">Diffuse light, often called soft light, is light <a id="_idIndexMarker588"/>that has spread out from its source. A table lamp with a shade will create diffuse light because the shade spreads the light coming from the bulb. Without the shade, the lamp would create brighter, harsher light.</p>
			<p>Before going out to <a id="_idIndexMarker589"/>purchase lights, if you have table lamps, you can try positioning them at a 45-degree angle and at eye level. Floor lamps pointed at the ceiling and set to maximum brightness can also provide great lighting:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer522" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.5_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 11.5 – Table lamp placed 45 degrees from the teacher&#13;&#10;" width="380" height="563"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.5 – Table lamp placed 45 degrees from the teacher</p>
			<p>In general, avoid using ceiling lights. Since they often point directly downward, sitting directly beneath them will cast shadows around your eyes. At best, you will look tired; at worst, you will look like a raccoon. If ceiling lights are <a id="_idIndexMarker590"/>the only light source you have, sit as far away from the ceiling light as possible while still being visible onscreen.</p>
			<h3>Purchasing lights</h3>
			<p>When purchasing lights, there is a deep rabbit hole you can fall into. Studio lights can cost thousands of <a id="_idIndexMarker591"/>dollars for just a single light. Those expensive lights are most likely not needed, and amateur or prosumer lights will be more than adequate. Online retailers such as Amazon have lighting kits containing two lights, soft box diffusers, and stands for $150 USD. If space is limited, the Elgato Key light is a great all-in-one solution that attaches to your desk.</p>
			<p>However, it is $200 USD for a single light. A budget alternative is going to your local furniture store and purchasing a 100 W warm bulb and China ball paper lantern. Depending on your local market, this solution can cost as little as $25 USD.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Warm and cold lights</p>
			<p class="callout">The temperature of a light describes the amount of yellow or blue tinting in the light. Different light sources produce different temperature lights. For example, tungsten bulbs tend to have more yellow or warmer lighting, while fluorescent tubes tend to have bluer or cooler lighting. Warmer lighting tends to feel cozier, while cooler lighting tends to feel more clinical.</p>
			<p>There are lots of things you must take into consideration when placing lights in a room. Check out YouTube and other internet sites for tutorials and tips on various types of lighting setups.</p>
			<h3>Purchasing cameras</h3>
			<p>Like their <a id="_idIndexMarker592"/>microphones, many built-in laptop or desktop webcams are low quality. An external camera will almost always be far superior to any built-in webcam you have.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important</p>
			<p class="callout">At the time of writing, which is during the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand and price of webcams have skyrocketed. While this book will use current prices for many of these devices, hopefully, by the time you are reading this chapter, the prices will have gone down.</p>
			<p>Before diving into the recommendations, the following screenshot shows a comparison of pictures that have been taken with different cameras. No post processing other than cropping was done to the pictures:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer523" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.6_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 11.6 – Quality comparison between cameras&#13;&#10;" width="800" height="293"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.6 – Quality comparison between cameras</p>
			<p>The Logitech C920 is the gold standard for USB webcams. It is $80 USD, though it is often out of stock because of its popularity. The Logitech C920S and Logitech C922X are newer models of the C920 but offer the same video quality as the C920. The two newer models cost $100 USD and $130, respectively. For the best video quality in a USB webcam, Avermedia's Live Streamer CAM 513 will set you back $250 USD.</p>
			<p>If you're on a budget but have an <a id="_idIndexMarker593"/>old smartphone, you can use the cameras on your smartphone as a webcam. Third-party apps such as EpocCam and DroidCam can send iPhone and Android camera signals through Wi-Fi or USB. Both include free versions so that you can test your old phone. One area to test is whether the computer microphone de-syncs with the smartphone webcam, since these apps can introduce a delay in the video. Both have paid versions (less than $10 USD) that remove ads and add additional features.</p>
			<p>Be cautious if you are purchasing cheaper webcams (less than $40 USD). Our school made the mistake of purchasing many of these cheap webcams and they would often freeze or cut out after a few minutes. Ensure that there is a return policy and test the device thoroughly so that you can return it if there are any problems.</p>
			<p>On the other side of the cost spectrum, many action cameras, point-and-shoots, DSLR, and mirrorless cameras can use their USB connection to act as a webcam. These cameras can range from the GoPro Hero 8 action camera, priced at $320 USD, to the Canon EOS R5, priced at $5,000 USD. Many of the DSLR and mirrorless cameras also have interchangeable lenses, which adds an additional cost.</p>
			<p>Another <a id="_idIndexMarker594"/>consideration is the camera's battery life. Many of these cameras can also draw power from the USB connection or may use a battery coupler, often called a dummy battery, to plug the camera into an outlet. If you choose to purchase a camera as a webcam, consider its uses when you're not teaching. Since I have a 3-year-old, purchasing a GoPro and, later, a mirrorless camera means that I can take better photos of my child as she grows up.</p>
			<p>I use the Canon EOS M200 ($550 USD) with the Canon EF-M 22mm lens ($250 USD) when teaching my online students. Another great camera choice is the Canon EOS M50 Mark II ($700 USD), which has better video-making features than the M200. While camera selection is a personal choice, Canon cameras have fast autofocus and color accuracy, which is why I recommend them.</p>
			<p>As with microphones, consider testing one or two solutions before finalizing which camera solution you use in your online classes.</p>
			<h3>Consider the background</h3>
			<p>With the camera set, all that's left is the background. Your background is similar to your desk in an in-person class; it <a id="_idIndexMarker595"/>provides context about yourself to your students. As with the rest of the topics in this section, creating an engaging background can be as simple or as over-the-top as you see fit.</p>
			<p>A simple and cost-free solution is to use the built-in background changer in Google Meet. Having a monotone background such as an empty wall will help the background changer distinguish between you and your background. One disadvantage when using the background changer is that it will sometimes remove something that you are trying to show your students. An example of this problem is shown in the following image:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer524" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.7_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 11.7 – The item in my hand has been removed from the video&#13;&#10;" width="608" height="355"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.7 – The item in my hand has been removed from the video</p>
			<p>If you do have a monotone background, instead of using the background changer, you can fill it with items that are used in your online teaching. Examples include hanging pictures or puppets that are used for lessons. Alternatively, you can decorate the background near holidays such as Christmas or Easter. If there is sufficient space between you and the wall, another method of adding to your background is to place a shelf and fill it with objects or books.</p>
			<p>Some teachers even hang Christmas lights on their walls! These small touches can make a student feel more welcome and ready to learn when they see you online.</p>
			<p>Another tool you can use to <a id="_idIndexMarker596"/>change your background is a green screen. This monochromatic background makes replacing it, called <strong class="bold">keying</strong>, more <a id="_idIndexMarker597"/>uniform. Furthermore, other software such as OBS Studio can overlay images or other inputs to create picture-in-picture effects, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.8 – Webcam and screen picture-in-picture effect</p>
			<p>Now that your students can easily see and hear you, let's look at ways we can keep them engaged in online learning.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-148"><a id="_idTextAnchor148"/>Pedagogy in an online class</h1>
			<p>Back in 2011, one of my <a id="_idIndexMarker598"/>university professors warned the class that the teaching profession will change throughout our careers and that one day, we may all be teaching in front of computer screens. Though I already had a passion for educational technologies, his message encouraged me to be thoughtful of what online teaching would look like years before the COVID-19 pandemic forced everyone to teach online.</p>
			<p>Through exploring online platforms such as Moodle, to being able to teach various online courses in different formats, this section will talk about some strategies I learned while teaching online. These suggestions are based on my experiences and conversations with teachers in my professional learning communities. Not all these strategies will necessarily be adaptable to your pedagogy, but one or two may help make your online teaching experience easier.</p>
			<p>Before diving into these strategies, there are some terms we must define. There are many different formats when it comes to teaching online, and your school may use different terms to describe similar formats. The following are the terms I will be referencing within this section:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Synchronous</strong> teaching and learning is <a id="_idIndexMarker599"/>when the teacher is delivering content to students in real time. This format of online teaching is similar to in-person teaching, where the teacher and students interact continually. Oftentimes, interactions are done through Google Meets, where the teacher and students connect at a specific time.<p>The main advantage of this form of online teaching is that it is similar to in-person teaching and learning; some disadvantages include a higher chance of technical problems occurring that impede teaching and that students must be available at the given class time.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Asynchronous</strong> teaching and learning is <a id="_idIndexMarker600"/>when the teacher is not delivering content in real time. Often, the teacher releases a video that the students watch. This method often includes self-assessment questions. A teacher can use Google Meet to record a lesson, create Google Forms for student self-assessment, and release both resources on Google Classroom.<p>The main advantage of this form of online teaching is that students learn at their own pace; however, the disadvantage is that this method relies on the student's motivation and that it is more difficult for a struggling student to access support if the given resources are inadequate.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Concurrent</strong> teaching and learning is <a id="_idIndexMarker601"/>when the teacher is delivering content to in-person and online students at the same time. You can use Google Meet to connect online students to the in-person classroom. Depending on the class structure, the teacher can either be at a station and project the content so that it appears on the screen for the in-person students and is shared for the online students, or the teacher can have a laptop or Chromebook that they carry while moving around the classroom.<p>Another strategy that has been deployed at the primary school level is pairing an online student with an in-person student, and then having a student move and manage a Chromebook so that their online partner can see what their in-person partner sees.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Your online teaching format will affect your pedagogy. Many teachers may employ a combination of synchronous and asynchronous strategies for their students. For example, an online teacher at my school plays a pre-recorded lesson during class time in a Google Meet. When the video is complete, this teacher asks the students questions about the lesson and they have an opportunity to ask for clarification.</p>
			<p>To reduce the amount of preparation time they have to do, they record the next day's lesson while the students are watching the current video. Combining synchronous and asynchronous strategies can mitigate some of the disadvantages that each teaching format has. Another aspect of online teaching that can affect pedagogy is your class size. It is not unheard of to have online classes with more students enrolled than their in-person counterparts.</p>
			<p>Being able to give <a id="_idIndexMarker602"/>meaningful feedback to 45 students in an English class is more time-consuming than giving it to 30 students. Therefore, when you're determining how to structure your online class, be thoughtful about how you may have to adjust your pedagogy so that it fits the format and composition of your online class.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-149"><a id="_idTextAnchor149"/>Consistency</h2>
			<p>A large part of <a id="_idIndexMarker603"/>classroom management is setting out predictable routines for students. For an in-person environment, this process often means seating plans, morning routines, weekly lesson schedules, and consistent teaching formatting. In an online class, many of these characteristics require adjustment, while some no longer apply.</p>
			<p>While seating plans are irrelevant for online classes, having clear expectations for your students' online interaction is important. Be clear with students about whether webcams need to be <em class="italic">on</em> during lessons and how students ask questions or use the chat. Oftentimes, teachers will spend the first day going through online class procedures, such as muting microphones, raising hands, going into and out of a breakout room, answering poll questions, and so on.</p>
			<p>When students know how to use the features, they will be more likely to use them. When a student deviates from that online structure, it is important to guide them back. For example, students occasionally email me questions outside of class time. Since my Class has a section for students to ask questions, during the next lesson, I will answer the question but remind the class to use the question section in Classroom or risk not having their question answered.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Set clear boundaries</p>
			<p class="callout">Just because you can connect with your students at home doesn't mean that they should be able to interact with you at all hours. Communicate clear expectations so that you do not feel obligated to answer student emails. My classroom expectations are that students can email me questions (in-person) or ask a question in Classroom (online) and I will answer it at the beginning of the next class if it is not an emergency.</p>
			<p>Another area where consistency can encourage students in an online class is to release information at the same time every day. When I taught an online asynchronous class, my students knew that every day at 3:00 P.M., the lesson would be released on Google Classroom. They became so familiar with that time that my students would flood my email inbox at 3:15 P.M., asking if there was no new video. Furthermore, each day had an <strong class="bold">Assignment</strong> post or a discussion question (via the <strong class="bold">Announcement</strong> post containing the video's class comments section) for the students to respond to the video.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important</p>
			<p class="callout">When teaching a class with synchronous and asynchronous components, give clear expectations about when students need to be online.</p>
			<p>For my synchronous and asynchronous online classes, exams were always on the same day of the week. Because my asynchronous class was later than a typical class (running from 3:00 P.M. to 4:30 P.M. daily), it was important to keep the day of the week consistent so that my students could work around other afternoon commitments.</p>
			<p>Finally, as <a id="_idIndexMarker604"/>with in-person classes, stay consistent with the lesson format for the first few lessons. As students become familiar with how your online class functions, you can start adding new lesson formats. While it is important to diversify your teaching style to reach as many students as possible, it is also important to ensure that your students feel comfortable in the teaching and learning environment by being able to predict what will happen in class.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-150"><a id="_idTextAnchor150"/>Structuring resources in the online class</h2>
			<p>Just like online classroom expectations <a id="_idIndexMarker605"/>can guide student learning, how the Class is set up in Google Classroom can impact how easily a student will find information and resources. Ultimately, Google Classroom is a website. Because your Class is the primary means of communicating information to your online students, many concepts of website design apply to organizing content so that students can find it.</p>
			<p>For example, it should be easy to find information that students will use regularly. If students have to scroll endlessly through your <strong class="bold">Stream</strong> to find that one post containing a critical document, many students will give up before finding it. Furthermore, the content should be easy to navigate, which means that students should be able to find what they're looking for with relative ease.</p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows two ways we can organize the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> tab. While the subject specific method makes it easier to see all the assignments of one subject, if a student misses a day of class, that student now has to find information in several locations of <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong>:</p>
			<div>
				<div id="_idContainer526" class="IMG---Figure">
					<img src="Images/Figure_11.9_B16846.jpg" alt="Figure 11.9 – Subject organization versus date organization of Classwork posts&#13;&#10;" width="863" height="652"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 11.9 – Subject organization versus date organization of Classwork posts</p>
			<p>Since the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> page is easier to organize than <strong class="bold">Stream</strong>, use <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> as much as possible for <a id="_idIndexMarker606"/>online classes. The average web surfer will spend 15 seconds trying to find information on a page. Since Google Classroom creates topics at the top of <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong>, it is important to rearrange important topics, such as data booklets and other resources, near the top since they will progressively move lower when new topics are added. Then, students can find the information quickly with a minimal number of clicks.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important</p>
			<p class="callout">Starting each post in <strong class="bold">Stream</strong> and <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> with the date can also help students find items on the page. </p>
			<p>While it may seem easier to organize information by subject or unit, many post-secondary institutions that have offered online courses for years use a week-by-week organization structure rather than a topic-based one. (If you are sharing many items per day, you may even choose a day-by-day system.) I find that this method works best for primarily online and/or asynchronous teaching because students can track their progress easier.</p>
			<p>The final strategy you <a id="_idIndexMarker607"/>can use to help organize content in Classroom is to use emojis in topics and posts. Oftentimes, when I want to highlight a specific post, I will use the star emoji. For topics, I will use a notebook emoji for topics still in progress and green checkmarks for those that are complete, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

			<p>Using emojis can be a fun way to categorize content. Don't forget to remove emojis from posts when they are no longer needed. A strategy you can try is to star every post for the week and then, first thing on Monday, remove all the stars so that the new week has a fresh start.</p>
			<p>There is a myriad of different ways you can organize your <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> tab. Now that you know the importance of ensuring that relevant information is easy to find, adjusting your <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> post's organization can make a significant difference when it comes to students accessing class resources.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-151"><a id="_idTextAnchor151"/>Where can students find support?</h2>
			<p>Despite a regular lesson schedule and a well-structured Class, students will still need individual support. Teaching is a profession that can quickly encroach into personal time without boundaries. I have heard many stories from online teachers where students will email during all hours of the day, expecting an immediate response. What can exacerbate this <a id="_idIndexMarker608"/>situation is that, without clear expectations, parents can also expect an on-call availability from the teacher. Therefore, it is important to communicate and have a student support system early in the school year to avoid these problems.</p>
			<p>There are a few strategies that provide students with an online resource to ask questions. When I taught my asynchronous online class, my students received two or three posts in classwork a day: a video lesson with a discussion question, a daily assignment that occasionally replaced the discussion question, and a question post for students to ask questions about the lecture. Then, when I recorded the next day's lesson, I would go through the questions that students asked and answer them at the beginning of the video lesson.</p>
			<p>For Classes with many daily posts, adding another daily post for questions can clutter the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> page. Another alternative is to use a Google Form and place it near the top of the <strong class="bold">Classwork</strong> page. Since Google Forms can automatically record the date and time of the submission and the email address of the student, it is easy to see new questions. Depending on the frequency of questions, the <strong class="bold">Forms Notifications</strong> plugin can automatically email you whenever Google Form receives a new submission.</p>
			<p>When teaching an online synchronous class, you can tell students to put questions from their homework in the <strong class="bold">Q&amp;A</strong> section and students can vote on questions. Then, you can answer the most upvoted questions. This strategy works best for courses that have practice questions, such as math and science. Another advantage is that you still have a record of the questions that were unanswered. You can then address those questions later in the lesson.</p>
			<p>Whether you use one of the suggestions in this section or create your own, students and parents will know where and when to get support. While I answer questions at the beginning of class (so that other students who may have similar questions also hear the answer), I have also responded to student emails in the evening if the questions are urgent. I also know teachers who have evening hours, where they will respond to student emails too. Whatever method you decide, if students and parents know how to connect for additional support, there will be fewer issues with miscommunication and wrong assumptions being made throughout the course.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-152"><a id="_idTextAnchor152"/>Assessment</h2>
			<p>With online teaching strategies, assessment is a <a id="_idIndexMarker609"/>component of pedagogy that comes under significant debate within the online classroom environment. Before progressing through this section, I want to reinforce that the perspectives and opinions in this chapter are from my own teaching, collaboration with teacher colleagues, and conversations with educators within Canada, the United States, and beyond.</p>
			<p>However, these perspectives and opinions are perspectives and opinions only. With the explosion of online teaching and learning, relevant peer-reviewed journal articles exploring the efficacy of online assessments are few and far between. Internet searches during the pandemic will bring up headlines of school divisions pausing standardized exams, privacy concerns where online invigilation protocols are invasive and stress-inducing, and some institutions forcing hundreds of students to rewrite major online assessments because of some students' liberal use of online resources during an exam.</p>
			<p>At my school, hours and hours of teacher leadership time has been spent discussing authentic online assessment. Only one conclusion has come from all those hours:</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">There is no authentic online assessment</strong>.</p>
			<p>No matter what protocols are put in place during a high-stakes exam, there will always be ways of defeating online securities. Regardless, there are still several nuggets of wisdom I can pass along from my experience and the experience of my colleagues regarding privacy considerations, types of online assessment, and the advantages and disadvantages of online assessment tools.</p>
			<p>This year, many of my math and science colleagues have created new assessments for the online environment. The primary reason for these new exams is because the in-person exams they used to use took years to develop. With countless hours being spent creating questions, blueprinting exams to the curriculum, and then fine tuning and publishing those exams online was not possible. There are many ways to screenshot, screen record, or simply write down questions while completing a high-stakes exam. Then, those well-crafted in-person exams would no longer be secure. Students can then distribute the questions through various social media channels.</p>
			<p>A possible alternative to high-stakes exams is to adjust exam weightings and create several medium-to-low stakes assessments. Some online teachers have moved to 20- or 30-minute weekly quizzes that comprise the bulk of the exam rather than one or two high-stakes exams. Students are less likely to distribute the questions because they have access to the questions for less time and it is easier to create different versions of smaller quizzes. With this solution, I have seen course weightings invert from 20% Quizzes, 50% Unit Exams, 30% Other to 50% Quizzes, 20% Unit Exams, 30% Other. This format adapts well to online courses that organize with a weekly calendar too.</p>
			<p>Another alternative is to <a id="_idIndexMarker610"/>introduce more high-stakes projects instead of exams. Project-based learning involves students in the synthesis process of learning. Oftentimes, the project produces a product that is difficult to plagiarize. Some project examples include video shorts and video essays. Video shorts are 1-to-3-minute videos where students explain a topic or concept. In subjects such as math or science, each student can be assigned a different calculation problem to complete.</p>
			<p>Once all the students have submitted their videos, the class will contain a library of video tutorials. Video essays are longer videos that can replace a written essay; however, they require more technical skills from the students. Video shorts can be easily created by recording a Google Meet, using a phone camera, or using free online tools such as Screencastify. For video editing features, they can use WeVideo, a free online video editor.</p>
			<p>Both Screencastify and WeVideo have a 5-minute video limit for their free tiers. Having a time limit is not necessarily a disadvantage because you still have to watch all the videos. If video creation sounds like a daunting task for your class, live presentations with Google Slides through Google Meet is another solution.</p>
			<p>If you are set on using high-stakes exams in an online environment, then there are still some strategies you can utilize to mitigate cheating. For the exam structure, consider open book exams with a narrow time limit. Then, the time limit – not the lack of resources – contributes to the authenticity of the assessment. This is the structure I have adapted for my online students with success. Additionally, another strategy for improving the authenticity of assessments is having students sign into Google Meet with a secondary device, such as a phone.</p>
			<p>The student places the device beside them so that their field of view includes their monitor, keyboard, face, and hands. On that device, the students also unmute their microphones. This setup allows you to have a better view of what the student is doing while taking the exam, and it also allows the students to see and hear you without having to put on a headset. If your students are writing an in-class paper using Google Docs, you can view their Google Doc and their camera at the same time if you are suspicious of their activities during an exam.</p>
			<p>One final strategy for <a id="_idIndexMarker611"/>high-stakes exams is to regularly ask students to perform tasks throughout. Some examples include touching the top of their head, clapping, standing up and sitting down, taking a 10-second stretch break, and so on. Asking the students to move around at random times ensures that they are not using a video recording as the webcam's source. Free software is available for users to use a video to mimic a webcam. Therefore, a student could pre-record themselves <em class="italic">writing an exam</em> and then play it while taking an actual exam, freeing the student to do whatever they want during the exam.</p>
			<p>The unfortunate truth about online high-stakes exam precautions is that they can be defeated with relative ease. The simplest method any student can use is simply asking to use the washroom during an exam. Not even expensive invigilation software or proctoring services can guarantee authenticity in online assessment. Therefore, adapting assessment practices for an online environment has a greater likelihood of accurately quantifying student understanding than holding them tightly to traditional assessment practices.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-153"><a id="_idTextAnchor153"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>This chapter has gone beyond the basic features of Google Classroom and Google Meet we covered previously by exploring external factors that can improve teaching online. These strategies include setting better audio and video so that students can easily follow your lessons; setting a consistent lesson structure so that students can predict how the lesson will flow; structuring the content in Classroom so that it is easier to find; and considerations for online assessment. Many of these suggestions are only a starting point. As you take ownership of your online classes, your pedagogy will continue to evolve.</p>
			<p>When in-person, there are many aspects of teaching and learning that we take for granted. If a student cannot hear the teacher, the teacher speaks louder; if a student is distracted with their phone, we can ask them to put it away or confiscate it; during exams, the classroom is a secure location. Transitioning to an online environment brings forth many challenges to the learning environment that were non-issues in an in-person classroom. Therefore, be gracious to yourself. Even if you only apply a few suggestions from this chapter, I hope that it demonstrates the several additional facets that teaching online brings to pedagogy. In general, students also know that learning online is different than in-person learning. Whatever effort you put in, even if they never admit it, is appreciated by your students.</p>
			<p>In the ever-changing landscape of technology in education, I hope this book has helped you navigate Google Classroom and how it can be integrated into your pedagogy. By implementing even a small portion of this learning management system's tools, you can reduce time in the day-to-day administrivia of teaching and spend more time with your students, your family, or yourself. All the best in teaching with Google Classroom!</p>
