It builds on jQuery UI, enhancing existing widgets, and adding new ones. In this book we examine the Wijmo widgets essential for web development. The useful configuration options for 15 widgets are covered along with their usage scenarios. Most of the chapters take a code recipe approach for tasks that occur often in web development. Whenever you come across a widget or user interface component that you've implemented before, chances are that Wijmo widgets have you covered. The chapters in this book are designed to get you started using the widgets in no time. On the other hand, <a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Dashboard with WijmoGrid">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Dashboard with Wijmo Grid</em></span>, takes a different approach in building an application and explaining how it works.</p><p>There is no need for going in sequence of the chapters if you're familiar with Wijmo. However, if you're experiencing Wijmo for the first time, I would recommend going in the same order as the chapters.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>You will need a text editor with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML syntax highlighting. Notepad++ on Windows or Textmate on Mac is sufficient. Developing with Wijmo does not require fancy editor features, such as auto-complete or warnings for JavaScript. The widgets are simple and easy to use.</p><p>Besides a text editor, you also need a web browser. An Internet Explorer version higher than Version 5, Firefox, Safari, or Chrome are all supported by Wijmo. You probably already have one installed and prefer one over another.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>The primary audience for this book are the web developers working on projects that require the use of ready-made widgets. jQuery UI lacks necessary components or features, whereas Wijmo provides both free, open source widgets, as well as a licensed option for more complex widgets. Since this book covers both the areas, developers working on open source projects can also benefit.</p><p>Since Wijmo is easy to use, many of the simpler examples can be understood by a beginner with JavaScript. When the previous condition is met, this book is the first book that a JavaScript beginner should read after learning jQuery. Learning how to use Wijmo widgets will reduce the unnecessary work of writing custom JavaScript.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Conventions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.</p><p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "The <code class="literal">widget</code> method returns the dialog HTML element."</p><p>A block of code is set as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">$("#dialog").wijdialog({captionButtons: {
  pin: { visible: false },
  refresh: { visible: false },
  toggle: { visible: false },
  minimize: { visible: false },
  maximize: { visible: false }
  }
});</pre></div><p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">maximize: {visible: true, click: function () {
  alert('To enlarge text, click the zoom icon.')
}, <span class="strong"><strong>iconClassOn: 'ui-icon-lightbulb'</strong></span>},
close: {visible: true, click: self.close, iconClassOn:'ui-icon-close'}</pre></div><p>
<span class="strong"><strong>New terms</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>important words</strong></span> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, in menus or dialog boxes, for example, appear in the text like this: "clicking the <span class="strong"><strong>Next</strong></span> button moves you to the next screen".</p><div class="note" title="Note" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="note01"/>Note</h3><p>Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.</p></div></div><div class="tip" title="Tip" style=""><div class="inner"><h3 class="title"><a id="tip01"/>Tip</h3><p>Tips and tricks appear like this.</p></div></div></div>
