<div><h1 class="header-title">Introduction</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Modern web applications usually require real-time communication where data is continuously flowing from client to server and vice versa with (almost) no delay.</p>
<p>The HTML5 WebSocket Protocol was created to fulfill this requirement. WebSocket uses a single TCP connection that is kept open even when the server or client is not sending any data. That means, while a connection between the client and the server exists, data can be sent at any time without having to open a new connection to the server.</p>
<p>Real-time communication has several applications from building chat applications to multi-user games, where the response time is really important.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will focus on learning how to build a real-time web application using Socket.IO (<a href="https://socket.io">https://socket.io</a>) and understanding the Node.js event-driven architecture.</p>
<p>Socket.IO is one of the most used libraries for implementing real-time communication. Socket.IO uses WebSocket whenever possible but falls-back to other methods when WebSocket is not supported on a specific web browser. Because you probably want to make your application accessible from any web browser, having to work directly with WebSocket may not seem like a good idea.</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Understanding Node.js events</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Node.js has an event-driven architecture. Most of Node.js' core API is built around <kbd>EventEmitter</kbd>. This is a Node.js module that allows <kbd>listeners</kbd> to subscribe to certain named events that can be triggered later by an <strong>emitter</strong>.</p>
<p>You can define your own event emitter easily by just including the events Node.js module and creating a new instance of <kbd>EventEmitter</kbd>:</p>
<pre>const EventEmitter = require('events') 
const emitter = new EventEmitter() 
emitter.on('welcome', () =&gt; { 
    console.log('Welcome!') 
}) </pre>
<p>Then, you can trigger the <kbd>welcome</kbd> event by using the <kbd>emit</kbd> method:</p>
<pre>emitter.emit('welcome') </pre>
<p>It is actually, pretty simple. One of the advantages is that you can subscribe multiple listeners to the same event, and they will get triggered when the <kbd>emit</kbd> method is used:</p>
<pre>emitter.on('welcome', () =&gt; { 
    console.log('Welcome') 
}) 
emitter.on('welcome', () =&gt; { 
    console.log('There!') 
}) 
emitter.emit('welcome') </pre>
<p>The <kbd>EventEmitter</kbd> API provides several helpful methods that give you more control to handle events. Check the official Node.js documentation to see all information about the API: <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/events.html">https://nodejs.org/api/events.html</a>.<a href="https://nodejs.org/api/events.html"/></p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Getting ready</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this recipe, you will create a class that will extend <kbd>EventEmitter</kbd>, and which will contain its own instance methods to trigger listeners attached to a specific event. First, create a new project by opening a Terminal and running the following line:</p>
<pre class="CommandLinePACKT"><strong>npm init</strong></pre>


            

            
        
    </div>



  
<div><h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Create a class that extends <kbd>EventEmitter</kbd> and define two instance methods called <kbd>start</kbd> and <kbd>stop</kbd>. When the <kbd>start</kbd> method is called, it will trigger all listeners attached to the <kbd>start</kbd> event. It will keep the starting time using <kbd>process.hrtime</kbd>. Then, when the <kbd>stop</kbd> method is called, it will trigger all listeners attached to the <kbd>stop</kbd> event passing as an argument the difference in time since the <kbd>start</kbd> method was called:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new file named <kbd>timer.js</kbd></li>
<li>Include the events NodeJS module:</li>
</ol>
<pre>      const EventEmitter = require('events') </pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Define two constants that we will use to convert the returned value of <kbd>process.hrtime</kbd> from seconds to nanoseconds and then to milliseconds:</li>
</ol>
<pre>      const NS_PER_SEC = 1e9 
      const NS_PER_MS = 1e6 </pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>Define a class named <kbd>Timer</kbd> with two instance methods:</li>
</ol>
<pre>      class Timer extends EventEmitter { 
          start() { 
              this.startTime = process.hrtime() 
              this.emit('start') 
          } 
          stop() { 
              const diff = process.hrtime(this.startTime) 
              this.emit( 
                  'stop', 
                  (diff[0] * NS_PER_SEC + diff[1]) / NS_PER_MS, 
              ) 
          } 
      } </pre>
<ol start="5">
<li>Create a new instance of the previously defined class:</li>
</ol>
<pre>      const tasks = new Timer() </pre>
<ol start="6">
<li>Attach an event listener to the <kbd>start</kbd> event that will have a loop that will perform multiplications. Afterwards, it will call the <kbd>stop</kbd> method:</li>
</ol>
<pre>      tasks.on('start', () =&gt; { 
          let res = 1 
          for (let i = 1; i &lt; 100000; i++) { 
              res *= i 
          } 
          tasks.stop() 
      }) </pre>
<ol start="7">
<li>Attach an event listener to the <kbd>stop</kbd> event that will print the time it took for the event <kbd>start</kbd> to execute all its attached listeners:</li>
</ol>
<pre>      tasks.on('stop', (time) =&gt; { 
          console.log(`Task completed in ${time}ms`) 
      }) </pre>
<ol start="8">
<li>Call the <kbd>start</kbd> method to trigger all <kbd>start</kbd> event listeners:</li>
</ol>
<pre>      tasks.start() </pre>
<ol start="9">
<li>Save the file</li>
<li>Open a new Terminal and run:</li>

<div><h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>When the <kbd>start</kbd> method is executed, it keeps the starting time using <kbd>process.hrtime</kbd>, which returns the current high-resolution real time in an array of two items, where the first item is a number that represents seconds while the second item is another number that represents nanoseconds. Then, it triggers all event listeners attached to the <kbd>start</kbd> event.</p>
<p>On the other side, when the <kbd>stop</kbd> method is executed, it uses the result of previously calling <kbd>process.hrtime</kbd> as an argument to the same function, which returns the difference in time. This is useful to measure the time from when the <kbd>start</kbd> method was called until the time when the <kbd>stop</kbd> method was called.</p>


            

            
        
    </div>



  
<div><h1 class="header-title">There's more...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>A common mistake is to assume that events are called asynchronously. It is true that defined events can be called at any time. However, they are still executed synchronously. Take the following example:</p>
<pre>const EventEmitter = require('events') 
const events = new EventEmitter() 
events.on('print', () =&gt; console.log('1')) 
events.on('print', () =&gt; console.log('2')) 
events.on('print', () =&gt; console.log('3')) 
events.emit('print') </pre>
<p>The outputs for the preceding code will be shown as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>1 
2 
3</strong> </pre>
<p>If you have a loop running inside one of your events, the next event won't get called until the previous one finishes executing.</p>
<p>Events can be made asynchronous by simply adding an <kbd>async</kbd> function as an event listener. By doing so, every function will still be called in order from the first <kbd>listener</kbd> defined to the last. However, the emitter won't wait for the first <kbd>listener</kbd> to finish its execution to call the next listener. That means you cannot guarantee that the output will always be in the same order, for instance:</p>
<pre>events.on('print', () =&gt; console.log('1')) 
events.on('print', async () =&gt; console.log( 
    await Promise.resolve('2')) 
) 
events.on('print', () =&gt; console.log('3')) 
events.emit('print')  </pre>
<p>The outputs for the preceding code will be shown as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>1 
3 
2</strong> </pre>
<p>Asynchronous functions allow us to write non-blocking applications. If implemented correctly, you won't run into problems like this above.</p>
<p><kbd>EventEmitter</kbd> instances have a method called <kbd>listeners</kbd> which when executed, providing an event name as an argument, returns an array of the attached listeners for that specific event. We can use this method in a way to allow <kbd>async</kbd> functions to be executed in the order they were attached, for instance:</p>
<pre>const EventEmitter = require('events') 
class MyEvents extends EventEmitter { 
    start() { 
        return this.listeners('logme').reduce( 
            (promise, nextEvt) =&gt; promise.then(nextEvt), 
            Promise.resolve(), 
        ) 
    } 
} 
const event = new MyEvents() 
event.on('logme', () =&gt; console.log(1)) 
event.on('logme', async () =&gt; console.log( 
    await Promise.resolve(2) 
)) 
event.on('logme', () =&gt; console.log(3)) 
event.start() </pre>
<p>This will execute and display output in the order they were attached:</p>
<pre><strong>1 
2 
3</strong> </pre>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Understanding Socket.IO events</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Socket.IO is an event-driven module or library, and, as you probably guessed, is based on <kbd>EventEmitter</kbd>. Everything in Socket.IO works with events. An event is triggered when a new connection is made to the Socket.IO server and an event can be emitted to send data to the client.</p>
<p>The Socket.IO server API differs from the Socket.IO client API. However, both work with events to send data from client to server and vice versa.</p>


            

            
        
    </div>



  
<div><h1 class="header-title">The Socket.IO server events</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Socket.IO uses a single TCP connection to a single path. That means, by default, the connection is made to the URL <kbd>http[s]://host:port/socket.io</kbd>. However, within Socket.IO, it allows you to define <strong>namespaces</strong>. That means, different end-points but the connection will still remain a single URL.</p>
<p>By default, Socket.IO Server uses the <kbd>"/"</kbd> or root namespace</p>
<p>You can, of course, define multiple instances and listen to different URLs as well. However, we will assume, for the purpose of this recipe, that only one connection is created.</p>
<p>The Socket.IO namespace has the following events that your application can subscribe to:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>connect</kbd> or <kbd>connection</kbd>: When a new connection is made, this event is fired. It provides a <strong>socket object</strong> to the listener as the first parameter that represents the new connection with the client</li>
</ul>
<pre>      io.on('connection', (socket) =&gt; { 
          console.log('A new client is connected') 
      }) 
      // Which is the same as:<br/>       io.of('/').on('connection', (socket) =&gt; { 
          console.log('A new client is connected') 
      }) </pre>
<p>The Socket.IO socket object has the following events:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>disconnecting</kbd>: This event is emitted when the client is going to be disconnected from the server. It provides to the listener a parameter that specifies the reason for the disconnection</li>
</ul>
<pre>      socket.on('disconnecting', (reason) =&gt; { 
          console.log('Disconnecting because', reason) 
      }) </pre>
<ul>
<li><kbd>disconnected</kbd>: Similar to the disconnecting event. However, this event is fired after the client has been disconnected from the server:</li>
</ul>
<pre>      socket.on('disconnect', (reason) =&gt; { 
          console.log('Disconnected because', reason) 
      }) </pre>
<ul>
<li><kbd>error</kbd>: This event is emitted when an error occurs within events</li>
</ul>
<pre>      socket.on('error', (error) =&gt; { 
          console.log('Oh no!', error.message) 
      }) </pre>
<ul>
<li><kbd>[eventName]</kbd>: A user-defined event that will get fired when the client emits an event with the same name. The client can emit an event providing data in the arguments. On the server, the event will be fired and it will receive the data sent by the client</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    </div>



  
<div><h1 class="header-title">Socket.IO client events</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>A client doesn't necessarily need to be a web browser. We could write a Node.js Socket.IO client application as well.</p>
<p>The Socket.IO client events are extensive and give a lot of control over your application:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>connect</kbd>: This event gets fired when there is a successful connection to the server</li>
</ul>
<pre>      clientSocket.on('connect', () =&gt; { 
          console.log('Successfully connected to server') 
      }) </pre>
<ul>
<li><kbd>connect_error</kbd>: This event is emitted when there is an error when trying to connect or reconnect to the server</li>
</ul>
<pre>      clientSocket.on('connect_error', (error) =&gt; { 
          console.log('Connection error:', error) 
      }) </pre>
<ul>
<li><kbd>connect_timeout:</kbd> By default, the timeout set before a <kbd>connect_error</kbd> and <kbd>connect_timeout</kbd> is emitted is 20 seconds. After this, the Socket.IO client may try to reconnect to the server once again:</li>
</ul>
<pre>      clientSocket.on('connect_timeout', (timeout) =&gt; { 
          console.log('Connect attempt timed out after', timeout) 
      }) </pre>
<ul>
<li><kbd>disconnect</kbd>: This event is fired when the client is disconnected from the server. An argument is provided specifying the reason of the disconnection:</li>
</ul>
<pre>      clientSocket.on('disconnect', (reason) =&gt; { 
          console.log('Disconnected because', reason) 
      }) </pre>
<ul>
<li><kbd>reconnect</kbd>: Fired after a successful reconnection attempt. An argument is provided that specifies how many attempts happened before the connection was successful:</li>
</ul>
<pre>      clientSocket.on('reconnect', (n) =&gt; { 
          console.log('Reconnected after', n, 'attempt(s)') 
      }) </pre>
<ul>
<li><kbd>reconnect_attempt</kbd> or <kbd>reconnecting</kbd>: This event is emitted when trying to reconnect to the server. An argument is provided specifying the number of current attempts to connect to the server:</li>
</ul>
<pre>      clientSocket.on('reconnect_attempt', (n) =&gt; { 
          console.log('Trying to reconnect again', n, 'time(s)') 
      })  </pre>
<ul>
<li><kbd>reconnect_error</kbd>: Similar to the <kbd>connect_error</kbd> event. However, it gets fired only if there is an error when trying to reconnect to the server:</li>
</ul>
<pre>      clientSocket.on('reconnect_error', (error) =&gt; { 
          console.log('Oh no, couldn't reconnect!', error) 
      })  </pre>
<ul>
<li><kbd>reconnect_failed:</kbd> By the default, the maximum number of attempts is set to <kbd>Infinity</kbd>. That means, it is unlikely that this event will ever get fired. However, we can specify an option to limit the maximum number of connection attempts. Let's see that later:</li>
</ul>
<pre>      clientSocket.on('reconnect_failed', (n) =&gt; { 
    console.log('Couldn'nt reconnected after', n, 'times') 
      }) </pre>
<ul>
<li><kbd>ping</kbd>: In short, this event gets fired to check if the connection with the server is still alive:</li>
</ul>
<pre>      clientSocket.on('ping', () =&gt; { 
          console.log('Checking if server is alive') 
      }) </pre>
<ul>
<li><kbd>pong</kbd>: Fired when a response is received from the server after the event <kbd>ping</kbd> is fired. An argument is provided specifying the latency or response time:</li>
</ul>
<pre>      clientSocket.on('pong', (latency) =&gt; { 
          console.log('Server responded after', latency, 'ms') 
      }) </pre>
<ul>
<li><kbd>error</kbd>: This event is fired when an error occurs within events:</li>
</ul>
<pre>      clientSocket.on('error', (error) =&gt; { 
          console.log('Oh no!', error.message) 
      }) </pre>
<ul>
<li><kbd>[eventName]</kbd>: A user-defined event that gets fired when the event is emitted in the server. The arguments provided by the server will be received by the client.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this recipe, you will build a Socket.IO server and a Socket.IO client using what you have just learned about events. Before you start, create a new <kbd>package.json</kbd> file with the following content:</p>
<pre>{ 
  "dependencies": { 
    "socket.io": "2.1.0" 
  } 
} </pre>
<p>Then, install the dependencies by opening a Terminal and running:</p>

<p>A Socket.IO server will be built to respond to a single event named <kbd>time</kbd>. When the event is fired, it will get the server's current time and emit another event named <kbd>"got time?"</kbd> providing two arguments, the current <kbd>time</kbd> and a <kbd>counter</kbd> that specifies how many times a request was made.</p>
<ol>

<div><h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Everything works with events. Socket.IO allows events to be defined in the server side that the client can emit. On the other side, it also allows to define events in the client side that the server can emit.</p>
<p>When a user-defined event is emitted by the server side, the data is sent to the client. The Socket.IO client checks whether there is a listener for that event first. Then, if there is a listener, it will get triggered. The same thing happens the other way around when a user-defined event is emitted by the client side:</p>
<ol>
<li>An event listener <kbd>time</kbd> was added in our Socket.IO server's <strong>socket object</strong> which can be emitted by the client side</li>
<li>An event listener <kbd>"got time?"</kbd> was added in our Socket.IO Client which can be emitted by the server side</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>On connection, the client emits the <kbd>time</kbd> event first</li>
<li>Afterwards, the <kbd>time</kbd> event is fired on the server side which will emit the <kbd>"got time?"</kbd> event providing two arguments, the current server's <kbd>time</kbd> and a <kbd>counter</kbd> that specifies how many times a request was made</li>
<li>Then, the <kbd>"got time?"</kbd> event is fired on the client side receiving two arguments that were provided by the server, the <kbd>time</kbd> and a <kbd>counter</kbd></li>
</ol>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Working with Socket.IO namespaces</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Namespaces are a way of separating the business logic of your application while reusing the same TCP connection or minimizing the need for creating new TCP connections for to implement real-time communication between the server and the client.</p>
<p>Namespaces look pretty similar to ExpressJS' route paths:</p>
<pre>/home 
/users 
/users/profile </pre>
<p>However, as mentioned in previous recipes, these are not related to URLs. By default, a single TCP connection is created at this URL <kbd>http[s]://host:port/socket.io</kbd></p>
<p>Reusing the same event names is a good practice when using namespaces. For example, let's suppose that we have a Socket.IO server that we use to emit a <kbd>setWelcomeMsg</kbd> event when the client emits a <kbd>getWelcomeMsg</kbd> event:</p>
<pre>io.of('/en').on('connection', (socket) =&gt; { 
    socket.on('getWelcomeMsg', () =&gt; { 
        socket.emit('setWelcomeMsg', 'Hello World!') 
    }) 
}) 
io.of('/es').on('connection', (socket) =&gt; { 
    socket.on('getWelcomeMsg', () =&gt; { 
        socket.emit('setWelcomeMsg', 'Hola Mundo!') 
    }) 
}) </pre>
<p>As you can see, we defined a listener for the event <kbd>getWelcomeMsg</kbd> in two different namespaces:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the client is connected to the English or <kbd>/en</kbd> namespace, when the <kbd>setWelcomeMsg</kbd> event is fired, the client will receive <kbd>"Hello World!"</kbd></li>
<li>On the other hand, if the client is connected to the Spanish or <kbd>/es</kbd> namespace, when the <kbd>setWelcomeMsg</kbd> event is fired, the client will receive <kbd>"Hola Mundo!"</kbd></li>
</ul>

    </div>



  
<div><h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This is what happens on the server side:</p>
<ol>
<li>We defined two namespaces, <kbd>"/en"</kbd> and <kbd>"/es"</kbd>, then added a new event listener, <kbd>getData</kbd>, to the <strong>socket object.</strong></li>
<li>When the <kbd>getData</kbd> event is fired in any of the two defined namespaces, it will emit a data event and send an object, that contains a title and a message property, to the client</li>
</ol>
<p>On the client side, inside the script tag in our HTML document:</p>
<ol>
<li>Initially, a new socket is created for the namespace <kbd>"/en"</kbd>:</li>
</ol>
<pre>      const socket = manager.socket('/en')</pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>At the same time, we created two new <strong>sockets</strong> for the namespaces <kbd>"/en"</kbd> and <kbd>"/es"</kbd>. They will act as reserved connections:</li>
</ol>
<pre>      manager.socket('/en')<br/>      manager.socket('/es')</pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>After, an event listener connect was added that sends a request to the server on connection</li>
<li>Then, another event listener data was added that is fired when data is received from the server</li>
<li>Inside the event listener that handles onclick events for our button, we change the nsp property to switch to a different namespace. However, for this to happen, we had to disconnect the <strong>socket</strong> first, and call the open method to make a new connection again using the new namespace</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's see one of the confusing parts about reserved connections. When you create one or more <strong>sockets</strong> in the same namespace, the first connection is reused, for example:</p>
<pre>const first = manager.socket('/home')<br/>const second = manager.socket('/home') // &lt;- reuses first connection</pre>
<p>On the client side, if there were no reserved connections, then switching to a namespace that was not used before would result in a new connection being created.<br/>
If you are curious, remove these two lines from the <kbd>nsp-client.html</kbd> file:</p>
<pre>manager.socket('/en')<br/>manager.socket('/es')</pre>
<p>Afterwards, restart or run the Socket.IO server again. You will notice that there is a slow response when switching to a different namespace because a new connection is created instead of being reused.</p>
<p>There is an alternative way of achieving the same goal. We could have created two sockets that point to two different namespaces, <kbd>"/en"</kbd> and <kbd>"/es"</kbd>. Then, we could have added two event listeners connect and data to each socket. However, because the first and second socket would contain the same event names and receive data in the same format from the server, we would have gotten repeated code. Imagine the case if we had to do the same for five different namespaces that have the same event names and receive data in the same format, there would be too many repeated lines of code. This is where switching namespaces and reusing the same socket object is helpful. However, there may be cases were two or more different namespaces have different event names for different kinds of event, in that case, it is better to add event listeners for each of the namespaces separately. For example:</p>
<pre>const englishNamespace = manager.socket('/en')<br/>const spanishNamespace = manager.socket('/es')<br/>// They listen to different events<br/>englishNamespace.on('showMessage', (data) =&gt; {})<br/>spanishNamespace.on('mostrarMensaje', (data) =&gt; {})</pre>

<div><h1 class="header-title">There's more...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>On the client side, you have probably noticed one thing that we didn't use before, <kbd>io.Manager</kbd>.</p>


            

            
        
    </div>



  
<div><h1 class="header-title">io.Manager</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This allows us predefine or configure how new connections will be created. The options defined in a <kbd>Manager</kbd>, as the URL, will be passed to the socket on initiation.</p>
<p>In our HTML file, inside a <kbd>script</kbd> tag, we created a new instance of <kbd>io.Manager</kbd> and passed two arguments; the server URL and an options object including a <kbd>path</kbd> property which indicates where new connections will be made:</p>
<pre>const manager = new io.Manager( 
    'http://localhost:1337', 
    { path: '/socket.io' }, 
) </pre>
<p>To find out more about the <kbd>io.Manager</kbd> API visit the official documentation Website offer for Socket.IO <a href="https://socket.io/docs/client-api/#manager">https://socket.io/docs/client-api/#manager</a>.</p>
<p>Later, we used the <kbd>socket</kbd> method to initialize and create a new Socket for the provided namespace:</p>
<pre>const socket = manager.socket('/en') </pre>
<p>This way, it is easier to work with several namespaces at the same time without having to configure each one of them with the same options.</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Defining and joining Socket.IO rooms</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Within namespaces, you can define rooms or channels that a socket can join and leave.</p>
<p>By default, a room is created with a random un-guessable ID for the connected <strong>socket</strong>:</p>
<pre>io.on('connection', (socket) =&gt; { 
    console.log(socket.id) // Outputs socket ID 
}) </pre>
<p>On connection, when emitting an event, for example:</p>
<pre>io.on('connection', (socket) =&gt; { 
    socket.emit('say', 'hello') 
}) </pre>
<p>What happens underneath is similar to this:</p>
<pre>io.on('connection', (socket) =&gt; { 
    socket.join(socket.id, (err) =&gt; { 
        if (err) { 
            return socket.emit('error', err) 
        } 
        io.to(socket.id).emit('say', 'hello') 
    }) 
}) </pre>
<p>The <kbd>join</kbd> method was used to include the socket inside a room. In this case, the socket ID is the joint room, and the only client connected to that room is the socket itself.</p>
<p>Because a socket ID represents a unique connection with a client and, by default, a room with the same ID is created; all data sent by the server to that room will be received only by that client. However, if several clients or socket IDs join a room with the same name and the server sends data; all clients could be able to receive it.</p>

<p>Sending the same message or data, to more than one client, is called broadcasting. The method we have seen broadcasts a message to all clients, including the client that generated the request.</p>
<p>There are other several methods to broadcast a message. For instance:</p>
<pre>socket.to('commonRoom').emit('updateClientCount', data) </pre>
<p>Which will emit an <kbd>updateClientCount</kbd> event to all clients in <kbd>commonRoom</kbd> expect to the sender or the socket that originated the request.</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Writing middleware for Socket.IO</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Socket.IO allows us to define two kinds of middleware functions in the server side:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Namespace middleware</strong>: Registers a function that gets executed for every new connected Socket and has the following signature:</li>
</ul>
<pre>      namespace.use((socket, next) =&gt; { ... }) </pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>Socket middleware</strong>: Registers a function that gets executed for every incoming Packet and has the following signature:</li>
</ul>
<pre>      socket.use((packet, next) =&gt; { ... }) </pre>
<p>It works similarly to how ExpressJS middleware functions do. We can add new properties to the <kbd>socket</kbd> or <kbd>packet</kbd> objects. Then, we can call <kbd>next</kbd> to pass the control to the next middleware in the chain. If <kbd>next</kbd> is not called, then the <kbd>socket</kbd> won't be connected, or the <kbd>packet</kbd> received.</p>

<p>In this recipe, you will build a Socket.IO server application where you will define middleware functions to restrict access to a certain namespace as well as restricting access to a certain socket based on some criteria. Before you start, create a new <kbd>package.json</kbd> file with the following content:</p>

<div><h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Socket.IO's <kbd>attach</kbd> method expects to receive a HTTP server as a parameter in order to attach the Socket.IO server application to it. The reason why we can attach Socket.IO to an ExpressJS server application is because the <kbd>listen</kbd> method returns the underlying HTTP server to which ExpressJS is connected.</p>
<p>To sum up, the <kbd>listen</kbd> method returns the underlying HTTP server. Then, it is passed as a parameter to the <kbd>attach</kbd> method. This way, we can share the same connection with ExpressJS.</p>


            

            
        
    </div>



  
<div><h1 class="header-title">There's more...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>So far, we have seen that we can share the same underlying HTTP server between ExpressJS and Socket.IO. However, that is not all.</p>
<p>The reason why we define a Socket.IO path is actually useful when working with ExpressJS. Take the following example:</p>
<pre>const express = require('express') 
const io = require('socket.io')() 
const app = express() 
io.path('/socket.io')<br/> app.get('/socket.io', (req, res) =&gt; { 
    res.status(200).send('Hey there!') 
}) 
io.of('/').on('connection', socket =&gt; { 
    socket.emit('someEvent', 'Data from Server!') 
}) 
io.attach(app.listen(1337)) </pre>
<p>As you can see, we are using the same URL path for Socket.IO and ExpressJS. We accept new connections to the Socket.IO server on the <kbd>/socket.io</kbd> path, but we also send content for <kbd>/socket.io</kbd> using the GET route method.</p>
<p>Even though this preceding example won't actually break your application, make sure to never use the same URL path to serve content from ExpressJS and accept new connections for Socket.IO at the same time. For instance, changing the previous code to this:</p>
<pre>io.path('/socket.io')<br/> app.get('/socket.io/:msg', (req, res) =&gt; { 
    res.status(200).send(req.params.msg) 
}) </pre>
<p>While you may expect your browser, when visiting <kbd>http://localhost:1337/socket.io/message</kbd>, to display <kbd>message</kbd>, that won't be the case and you will see the following instead:</p>
<pre>{"code":0,"message":"Transport unknown"} </pre>
<p>That is because Socket.IO will interpret the incoming data first and it won't understand the data you just sent. In addition, your route handler will never be executed.</p>
<p>Besides that, the Socket.IO server also serves, by default, its own Socket.IO Client under the defined URL path. For example, try visiting <a href="http://localhost:1337/socket.io/socket.io.js">http://localhost:1337/socket.io/socket.io.js</a> and you will be able to see the minimized JavaScript code of the Socket.IO client.</p>
<p>If you wish to server your own version of Socket.IO client or if it is included in the bundle of your application, you can disable the default behavior in your Socket.IO server application with the <kbd>serveClient</kbd> method:</p>
<pre>io.serveClient(false) </pre>

<div><h1 class="header-title">Using ExpressJS middleware in Socket.IO</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Socket.IO namespace middleware works pretty similar to how ExpressJS middleware does. In fact, the Socket Object also contains a <kbd>request</kbd> and a <kbd>response</kbd> object that we can use to store other properties in the same manner as we do with ExpressJS middleware functions:</p>
<pre>namespace.use((socket, next) =&gt; { 
    const req = socket.request 
    const res = socket.request.res 
    next() 
}) </pre>
<p>Because ExpressJS middleware functions have the following signature:</p>
<pre>const expressMiddleware = (request, response, next) =&gt; { 
    next() 
} </pre>
<p>We can safely execute the same function in a Socket.IO namespace middleware passing the necessary arguments:</p>
<pre>root.use((socket, next) =&gt; { 
    const req = socket.request 
    const res = socket.request.res 
    expressMiddleware(req, res, next) 
}) </pre>
<p>However, that doesn't mean that all ExpressJS middleware functions will work out of the box. For example, if an ExpressJS middleware function uses methods only available within ExpressJS, it may fail or have an unexpected behavior.</p>

<p>In this recipe, we will see how to integrate the ExpressJS <kbd>express-session</kbd> middleware to share the session object between Socket.IO and ExpressJS. Before you start, create a new <kbd>package.json</kbd> file with the following content:</p>

  "dependencies": { 
    "express": "4.16.3", 
    "express-session": "1.15.6",

<p>Then, install the dependencies by opening a Terminal and running:</p>
<pre><strong>npm install</strong></pre>

<p>Build a Socket.IO client application that will connect to a Socket.IO server you will build next. Include a form where the user can type a username and a password to attempt to log in.

<p>When the session middleware is used inside ExpressJS, after modifying the session object, the <kbd>save</kbd> method is automatically called at the end of the response. However, that is not the case when using the session middleware in Socket.IO namespaces, that is why we call the <kbd>save</kbd> method manually to save the session back to the store. In our case, the store is the memory where the sessions are kept until the server stops.</p>
<p>Forbidding access to certain namespaces based on specific conditions is possible thanks to Socket.IO namespace middleware. If the control is not passed to the <kbd>next</kbd> handler, then the connection is not made. That's why after the login is successful, we ask the <kbd>/home</kbd> namespace to attempt to connect again.</p>
