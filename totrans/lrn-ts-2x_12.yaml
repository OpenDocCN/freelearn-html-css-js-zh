- en: In Angular, it is a common practice to use a service to interact with a REST
    API or with other resources, such as the localStorage API. The class below defines
    a service named `MovieService`, which can be used to send HTTP requests to the
    backend Node.js application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A service is just a class, and it doesn't require any special decorators. However,
    the following code snippet uses the `@Injectable` decorator because it is going
    to be injected into the `MovieComponent`. We will learn more about dependency
    injection later, in the *Dependency injection in Angular* section.

- en: The Angular components don't draw a clear separation between properties and
    states like React does, but we can still use the same mental model. A component
    renders some data. If the data is mutated by the component, we are talking about
    a smart component. If the component only reads the data, we are talking about
    a dumb component.
  prefs: []

- en: Just like we did in the React example, we have organized our project using multiple
    directories in a way that allows us to have very clear differentiation between
    smart and dumb components. The `components` directory contains only dumb components
    while the `pages` directory contains smart components.
