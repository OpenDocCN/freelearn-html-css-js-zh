    the IDE for the first time they did not like the dark color and syntax highlight
    theme, which is selected by default in a fresh installation of Aptana. Those guys
    prefer the traditional syntax-highlight with a white background and so on. No
    problem, let's change the theme back to the classic Eclipse theme with a few easy
    steps.

    The only thing we want to point out is that the items contained in the Navigation
    bar change by switching the perspective. How you can influence which menu item
    appears in which perspective, will be discussed in the *Customizing perspectives*

    element named **Source**.

    drag-and-drop, and the visibility of each button can also be controlled by the
    **Customize** **Perspective...** option.

    for a special activity or development process. A perspective can be easily adapted
    to your needs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But why define different perspectives?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because of the development of different programming languages, you need different
    views and editors. It is also possible to define a view for a specific project,
    for example, a project that often uses a terminal for shell actions should be
    contained in a **Terminal** view by default.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you're working with a notebook, but also often with an additional display,
    it is possible that you're often working between different display resolutions.
    So, there is a possible use case to define a perspective for each display resolution.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How you can change perspectives with the help of the Perspective menu is something
    we will cover in the following section. But there are more possibilities if you
    go to **Window** | **Navigation**. Besides the functions to open, close, and change,
    there are options to reset, save, and customize a perspective.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you have moved views by dragging-and-dropping, opening, or closing new views,
    or just resized view areas, the perspective will no longer look like the one that
    you have defined in the past. Therefore, you can reset a perspective to the one
    that you had saved. All positions, views, and so on will be restored.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example, if you add a new view to your perspective and save it, Aptana Studio
    displays the new view each time this perspective is opened. In addition, you can
    also save a copy of a perspective with a new name so it is possible to make very
    similar but still different perspectives.
  prefs: []

    each view is the same. A view can be opened by navigating to **Window** | **Show

    icon of the View menu, followed by the label (in our case **Outline**), and finally
    a **Close** button that removes a view from the perspective. But the tab of the
    view has additional features. You can drag-and-drop it to move the View to another
    area of the perspective (top, right, bottom, or left). If you double-click on
    it, the View will be maximized to the full size of the Aptana Studio window. If
    there is more than one view in the same area, the View tabs are strung together.

    is an additional maximize button at the extreme right, which has the same functionality
    as the double-click on the tab. With the second button from the right, you can
    minimize a view so you have more space for some other views such as the editors.
    The other buttons differ from view to view. These buttons control the appearance
    and functionality of each view.

    dialog where you configure and start a search, and a search view where the search
    results are listed. Additionally, there is a function to replace matched items
    and a preferences section for the search.

    in other words, the characters to be searched. Here you have the option of searching
    case sensitive or case insensitive. But the search pattern could also be a regular
    expression, which makes the search more powerful.

- en: Further, you can define a filename pattern that decides in which files Aptana
    Studio should search. This is very useful, so, for example, if you already know
    that the relevant search pattern can be in a PHP file, you use `*.php` as the
    file name pattern.

- en: Finally the scope, which can limit the number of files examined. The default
    setting for this value is the **Workspace** scope. This means, if you start a
    search with the scope **Workspace**, Aptana Studio will look for the pattern in
    all files and all projects in the **Workspace**. This could, under some circumstances,
    be very many files. Therefore, it is better to limit the scope from the start,
    for example, by selecting a resource. That's very quickly done. Before you open
    the search dialog, navigate to your **App Explorer** or **Project Explorer** view
    and select a folder where you want to search. Now open the search dialog and select
    in the **Scope** section the entry **Selected** **resources** and you're ready
    to search in a limited scope.

    you navigate through the search results with the **Show Next match** or **Show
    Previous match** function. So you don't get a dedicated editor for each opened
    file, which must also be closed every time.
