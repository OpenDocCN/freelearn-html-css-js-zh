<p>Welcome to <a href="8950bab6-3465-43c5-8ba7-15cb0513c346.xhtml">Chapter 10</a>, <em>Integrating Elm with Rails</em>. The goal of this chapter is to implement simple user authentication with Elm on the frontend. For the backend, we will use Ruby on Rails 5.1.5.</p>
<p>The topics we will cover include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting up a basic Rails 5.1.5 app using Codeanywhere</li>
<li>Installing Ruby 2.5.0 and Rails 5.1.5 on Codeanywhere</li>
<li>Creating a brand new Rails project</li>
<li>Integrating Elm with Rails 5.1.5</li>
<li>Adding our Elm weather app to our Rails app</li>
</ul>
<p>After completing this chapter, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install a brand new Rails project on Codeanywhere</li>
<li>Utilize the webpacker gem to work with Elm more easily</li>
<li>Integrate Elm-powered modules inside an existing Rails application</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Setting up a basic Rails 5.1.5 app using Codeanywhere</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p><strong>Codeanywhere</strong> is an online <strong>Integrated Development Environment</strong> (<strong>IDE</strong>), with a number of great features. You can access it by pointing your browser to <a href="http://codeanywhere.com">codeanywhere.com</a>.</p>
<p>To begin using it, a registration is needed.</p>
<p>Before actually being able to use a containerized Ubuntu 14.04 environment to run our Rails 5.1.5 app, Codeanywhere requires new registrants to confirm their email.</p>
<p>To begin, choose a new Blank Development Stack on Ubuntu 14.04, give it a name, for example, elmrails, and click the CREATE button.</p>
<p>Clicking the CREATE button will make a new Ubuntu 14.04 container, ready for us to work on. </p>
<p>A very important thing to note is the message we get in the editor pane of the Codeanywhere app. The editor pane is nothing fancy; it is simply the largest pane in an open Codeanywhere app, which lists open files as tabs. The message that we get upon a successful container creation lists the name of the container and some additional information, as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>elmrails Container</strong><br/><strong>Development Stack with your custom installed tools</strong><br/><br/><strong>This Codeanywhere Container comes with:</strong><br/><br/><strong>2GB of Disc Storage</strong><br/><strong>256MB RAM (+ 512 MB swap)</strong><br/><strong>Sudo access</strong><br/><strong>SSH access on hostXX.codeanyhost.com:12345</strong><br/><strong>Access to all HTTP and Websocket ports</strong><br/><strong>The operating system running on this Container is Ubuntu 14.04 (64 bit). Ubuntu uses Advanced Packaging Tool (apt) package manager. You can read more here: apt-get</strong><br/><br/><strong>To access an application running on your Container use the following link (ports 1024-9999 available):</strong><br/><br/><strong>http://&lt;containername&gt;-&lt;username&gt;&lt;123456&gt;.codeanyapp.com</strong><br/><br/><strong>To access your application over HTTPS, make sure your application is running on port 3000 and use the following link:</strong><br/><br/><strong>https://&lt;containername&gt;-&lt;username&gt;&lt;123456&gt;.codeanyapp.com</strong><br/><br/><strong>If the port is blocked by your firewall you can connect through the standard HTTP port: (replace XX with port you have specified in your app)</strong><br/><br/><strong>http://port-XX.&lt;containername&gt;-&lt;username&gt;&lt;123456&gt;.codeanyapp.com</strong><br/><br/></pre>
<p>Of all the information listed here, this is the most important to note:</p>
<pre>To access an application running on your Container use the following link (ports 1024-9999 available):<br/><br/>http://&lt;containername&gt;-&lt;username&gt;&lt;123456&gt;.codeanyapp.com</pre>
<p>The reason why this information is important is simple: that address will be the address that you'll need to open in your browser to see your working Rails application. However, it is still too early to do that, since we still need to install Ruby 2.5.0 and Rails 5.1.5.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Installing Ruby 2.5.0 and Rails 5.1.5 on Codeanywhere</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Once you have completed the container setup, click the link to the Editor, and you can get started installing Ruby 2.5.0 and Rails 5.1.5. Detailed instructions on how to do this can be found in the excellent online guide at the gorails.com website, at the following address: <a href="https://gorails.com/setup/ubuntu/14.04">https://gorails.com/setup/ubuntu/14.04</a>.</p>
<p>Here, we'll just list all the commands that need to be run in the console, as a quick overview. Note that the following commands can also be found in the code files that accompany this chapter.</p>
<p>Note that, at a certain point, you will need to run the command <kbd>rbenv install 2.5.0</kbd>, which will make the console seem frozen. To have a better idea of what is happening, you can run this command with the following flag:</p>
<pre><strong>rbenv install --verbose 2.5.0</strong></pre>
<p>Running this flag with the <kbd>rbenv install</kbd> command will turn on verbose logging so that you can see the progress of the installation in more detail, and not wonder if the app is doing anything at all.</p>
<p>The complete list of commands that should be run is as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -</strong><br/><strong>curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -</strong><br/><strong>echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list</strong><br/><strong>sudo apt-get update</strong><br/><strong>sudo apt-get install git-core curl zlib1g-dev build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev python-software-properties libffi-dev nodejs yarn</strong><br/><strong>cd</strong><br/><strong>git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv</strong><br/><strong>echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc</strong><br/><strong>echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc</strong><br/><strong>exec $SHELL</strong><br/><strong>git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build</strong><br/><strong>echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build/bin:$PATH"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc</strong><br/><strong>exec $SHELL</strong><br/><strong>rbenv install 2.5.0</strong><br/><strong>ruby -v</strong><br/><strong>rbenv global 2.5.0</strong><br/><strong>ruby -v</strong><br/><strong>gem install bundler</strong><br/><strong>node -v</strong><br/><strong>gem install rails -v 5.1.5</strong><br/><strong>rbenv rehash</strong><br/><strong>rails -v</strong></pre>
<p>Now that we have installed all the prerequisites, we'll install a Rails app. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Creating a brand new Rails project</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>To install a new Rails app, your <kbd>bash</kbd> needs to be inside the <kbd>workspace</kbd> folder. To verify you are in the right location, you should see the following output in the console:</p>
<pre><strong>cabox@box-codeanywhere:~/workspace$</strong></pre>
<p>Now, simply run the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>rails new simple --webpack=elm</strong></pre>
<p>Note that the word <kbd>simple</kbd> can be anything that you want. The word you choose to use will determine the folder name inside of which your Rails 5 app will be installed.</p>
<p>Next, in the left-hand pane of the Codeanywhere app, right-click on the bottom-most entry, which reads <kbd>elmrails</kbd>, and in the contextual menu that pops up, click the 'refresh' command. </p>
<p>Doing this will result in the tree structure being refreshed, and now you'll be able to see another folder, titled <kbd>simple</kbd>, listed inside the <kbd>elmrails</kbd> project folder, like this:</p>
<pre><strong>∨ elmrails<br/>  &gt; simple</strong></pre>
<p>Clicking on the <kbd>simple</kbd> folder's title inside the left-hand panel will toggle the visibility of the folder structure. If you click it to twirl it open, you'll see the following structure:</p>
<pre><strong>∨ simple<br/>  &gt; .git<br/>  &gt; app<br/>  &gt; bin<br/>  &gt; config<br/>  &gt; db<br/>  &gt; elm-stuff<br/>  &gt; lib<br/>  &gt; log<br/>  &gt; node_modules<br/>  &gt; public<br/>  &gt; test<br/>  &gt; tmp<br/>  &gt; vendor<br/>    .babelrc<br/>    .gitignore<br/>    .postcssrc.yml<br/>    config.ru<br/>    elm-package.json<br/>    Gemfile<br/>    Gemfile.lock<br/>    package.json<br/>    Rakefile<br/>    README.md<br/>    yarn.lock</strong></pre>
<p>Now that you are sure that you have successfully installed Rails, it's time to take it for a spin. Point your bash to the simple folder by running the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>cd simple</strong></pre>
<p>Now, type the command to spin up a Rails server:</p>
<pre><strong>rails s</strong></pre>
<p>You should get the following output in the console:</p>
<pre><strong>=&gt; Booting Puma</strong><br/><strong>=&gt; Rails 5.1.5 application starting in development</strong><br/><strong>=&gt; Run `rails server -h` for more startup options</strong><br/><strong>Puma starting in single mode...</strong><br/><strong>* Version 3.11.3 (ruby 2.5.0-p0), codename: Love Song</strong><br/><strong>* Min threads: 5, max threads: 5</strong>
<strong>* Environment: development</strong><br/><strong>* Listening on tcp://0.0.0.0:3000</strong><br/><strong>Use Ctrl-C to stop</strong></pre>
<p>Now's the time to look at our boilerplate Rails app running online. To do that, we'll need to reference the information we got after our Ubuntu container was created, that is, we need to check for the following information:</p>
<pre>To access an application running on your Container use the following link (ports 1024-9999 available):<br/><br/>http://&lt;containername&gt;-&lt;username&gt;&lt;123456&gt;.codeanyapp.com</pre>
<p>Note that when we ran the <kbd>rails s</kbd> command, the console output ended with this line:</p>
<pre>* Listening on tcp://0.0.0.0:3000</pre>
<p>That means that our Rails app is being served at the address that satisfies the following pattern:</p>
<pre>http://&lt;containername&gt;-&lt;username&gt;&lt;123456&gt;.codeanyapp.com:3000</pre>
<p>If you open a new tab in your browser and point it at this address, you'll see the Rails 5 splash screen greeting:</p>
<pre>&lt;Rails logo&gt;<br/>Yay! You’re on Rails!<br/>&lt;A drawing&gt;<br/>Rails version: 5.1.5<br/>Ruby version: 2.5.0 (x86_64-linux)</pre>
<p>In this section, we have successfully installed Rails. Not only that, but by providing the <kbd>--webpack=elm</kbd> flag to our Rails project creation command, we successfully integrated Elm with our new Rails project.</p>
<p>That's why we had to go through a relatively long installation of Rails 5.1.5 at the beginning of this chapter: to have a simple, painless integration of Rails and Elm.</p>
<p>In the next section, we'll start modifying our Rails app and start using Elm inside of it.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Integrating Elm with Rails 5.1.5</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>When running a <kbd>rails new &lt;projectname&gt;</kbd> command without passing any additional flags, the resultant Rails app that gets created is a default one, without Elm integration. It might be a good exercise to delete the folder of the new Rails project we made in the previous step and run a new Rails project creation command, this time without passing flags. However, to avoid the waste of time involved in doing such a thing, we are going to list here some of the additional files that get created when we pass the <kbd>--webpack=elm</kbd> flag to the <kbd>rails new &lt;projectname&gt;</kbd> command.</p>
<p>To understand how Elm integrates with Rails, the best place to start is the <kbd>app/javascript</kbd> folder, and inside that folder, the <kbd>hello_elm.js</kbd> file.</p>
<p>Here are the contents of <kbd>hello_elm.js</kbd>:</p>
<pre>// Run this example by adding &lt;%= javascript_pack_tag "hello_elm" %&gt; to the<br/>// head of your layout file, like app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.<br/>// It will render "Hello Elm!" within the page.<br/><br/>import Elm from '../Main'<br/><br/>document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () =&gt; {<br/>  const target = document.createElement('div')<br/><br/>  document.body.appendChild(target)<br/>  Elm.Main.embed(target)<br/>})</pre>
<p>This JavaScript file will take the view rendered by the <kbd>Main.elm</kbd> file and embed it inside a <kbd>div</kbd> element.</p>
<p>But where will this <kbd>div</kbd> element live? That is entirely up to us.</p>
<p>For example, the first three lines of <kbd>hello_elm.js</kbd> are actually one-line JavaScript comments, and they give us exact instructions on how to render the Elm-powered view in the layout file of our Rails site.</p>
<p>As the commented-out instruction reads, we need to go to the default layout view of our Rails app, which is <kbd>application.html.erb</kbd>.</p>
<p>The full path to this file is <kbd>simple/app/views/layouts/application.html.erb</kbd>.  So let's open this file and add <kbd>javascript_pack_tag</kbd> to its <kbd>head</kbd>, like this:</p>
<pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br/>&lt;html&gt;<br/>  &lt;head&gt;<br/>    &lt;title&gt;Simple&lt;/title&gt;<br/>    &lt;%= csrf_meta_tags %&gt;<br/><br/>    &lt;%= stylesheet_link_tag 'application', media: 'all', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %&gt;<br/>    &lt;%= javascript_include_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %&gt;<br/>     &lt;%= javascript_pack_tag "hello_elm" %&gt;<br/>  &lt;/head&gt;<br/>...</pre>
<p>Finally, to hook everything up, we need to make <kbd>application#index</kbd> the default route that our Rails app will open. We will do that by updating the <kbd>routes.rb</kbd> file, located inside the <kbd>simple/config/</kbd> folder:</p>
<pre>Rails.application.routes.draw do<br/>  # For details on the DSL available within this file, see http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html<br/>  root 'application#index'<br/>end</pre>
<p>In this file, we only added the <kbd>root 'application#index'</kbd> route, just above the last line of the file. Doing this says to our Rails app that we want to route it to the application controller's index action as the default route, or <em>root</em> route.</p>
<p>If we refresh our running app in the browser, at this point we will get the following error:</p>
<pre>Unknown action<br/>The action 'index' could not be found for ApplicationController</pre>
<p>That means that we need to add the index view for our <kbd>ApplicationController</kbd>. To do that, let's simply create a new folder inside the <kbd>views</kbd> folder. We'll call this new folder <kbd>application</kbd>. Next, inside the <kbd>application</kbd> folder, let's create a new file, which we'll call <kbd>index.html.erb</kbd>.</p>
<p>Note that in order to create folders and files in Codeanywhere, you need to right-click on the parent folder that should contain them. Then, choose either the <em>Create Folder</em> or the <em>Create File</em> command, depending on your needs. Once you make your choice, a modal will appear, and you will be able to input the name of your file or folder, depending on the command you picked.</p>
<p>Next, open the newly-created <kbd>index.html.erb</kbd> file and type only one line of code inside it:</p>
<pre>&lt;h1&gt;Successfully integrated Elm and Rails!&lt;/h1&gt;<br/>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<p>Next, save everything and refresh the page in which you are viewing your Rails app (which had the Rails splash screen).</p>
<p>Next, open the bash tab that has your Rails server running. Notice that the console is outputting the following messages:</p>
<pre><strong>[Webpacker] Compiling…</strong><br/><strong>[Webpacker] Compiled all packs in /home/cabox/workspace/simple/public/packs</strong><br/><strong>Completed 200 OK in 187478ms (Views: 187460.0ms)</strong></pre>
<p>These messages mean that the webpacker is at work, compiling your Elm code and integrating it inside your Rails project. As you can see from the output, it took about 188 seconds for this compilation to complete. Once it's done, you can refresh the page in which you are previewing your served Rails app, and now, instead of the default Rails app splash screen, you should see the following message in the upper-center part of the screen:</p>
<pre><strong>Hello Elm!</strong></pre>
<p>Having your Rails app serve this message in the default route means that you have successfully integrated Elm with Rails.</p>
<p>Now that we have successfully integrated Elm with our Rails app, let's further improve on our results by building something a bit more complex.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Adding our Elm weather app to our Rails app</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="mce-root">In this section, we will improve our Rails app by adding the Elm weather app to it. We will use the finished version of the weather app, as we had it at the end of <a href="5fdf7617-7e2c-4ff4-a7eb-28033a281ad5.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Adding More Features to the Weather App</em>.</p>
<p class="mce-root"> To do that, let's open the <kbd>elm-package.json</kbd> file in the root of our Rails app, and update it with additional dependencies, so that the complete updated file looks as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>{</strong><br/><strong>    "version": "1.0.0",</strong><br/><strong>    "summary": "helpful summary of your project, less than 80 characters",</strong><br/><strong>    "repository": "https://github.com/user/project.git",</strong><br/><strong>    "license": "BSD3",</strong><br/><strong>    "source-directories": [</strong><br/><strong>        "app/javascript"</strong><br/><strong>    ],</strong><br/><strong>    "exposed-modules": [],</strong><br/><strong>    "dependencies": {</strong><br/><strong>        "debois/elm-mdl": "8.1.0 &lt;= v &lt; 9.0.0",</strong><br/><strong>        "elm-lang/core": "5.0.0 &lt;= v &lt; 6.0.0",</strong><br/><strong>        "elm-lang/html": "2.0.0 &lt;= v &lt; 3.0.0",</strong><br/><strong>        "elm-lang/http": "1.0.0 &lt;= v &lt; 2.0.0",</strong><br/><strong>        "myrho/elm-round": "1.0.2 &lt;= v &lt; 2.0.0"</strong><br/><strong>    },</strong><br/><strong>    "elm-version": "0.18.0 &lt;= v &lt; 0.19.0"</strong><br/><strong>}</strong></pre>
<p>Next, we need to install the packages. We can't install them directly via Elm, but rather by using Yarn. The command we need to run is this:</p>
<pre><strong>yarn run elm package install</strong></pre>
<p>The console will print out the following to the screen:</p>
<pre><strong>yarn run v1.5.1</strong><br/><strong>$ /home/cabox/workspace/simple/node_modules/.bin/elm package install</strong><br/><strong>Some new packages are needed. Here is the upgrade plan.</strong><br/><br/><strong>  Install:</strong><br/><strong>    debois/elm-dom 1.2.3</strong><br/><strong>    debois/elm-mdl 8.1.0</strong><br/><strong>    elm-lang/dom 1.1.1</strong><br/><strong>    elm-lang/mouse 1.0.1</strong><br/><strong>    elm-lang/window 1.0.1</strong><br/><strong>    myrho/elm-round 1.0.2</strong><br/><br/><strong>Do you approve of this plan? [Y/n] y</strong><br/><strong>Starting downloads...</strong><br/><br/><strong>  ● debois/elm-dom 1.2.3</strong><br/><strong>  ● elm-lang/mouse 1.0.1</strong><br/><strong>  ● elm-lang/dom 1.1.1</strong><br/><strong>  ● debois/elm-mdl 8.1.0</strong><br/><strong>  ● elm-lang/window 1.0.1</strong><br/><strong>  ● myrho/elm-round 1.0.2</strong><br/><br/><strong>Packages configured successfully!</strong><br/><strong>Done in 25.23s.</strong></pre>
<p>Now, we need to make a new file, which we will call <kbd>WeatherApp.elm</kbd>. Next, we can simply copy and paste the complete weather app into this file. The only change we need to make to it is in the first line, which needs to look like this:</p>
<pre>module WeatherApp exposing (..)</pre>
<p>The complete code for the <kbd>WeatherApp.elm</kbd> file can be found in the code files for <a href="5fdf7617-7e2c-4ff4-a7eb-28033a281ad5.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Adding More Features to the Weather App</em>, (since we are using the code that can be found in the <kbd>Main.elm</kbd> file of the improved weather app we completed at the end of <a href="5fdf7617-7e2c-4ff4-a7eb-28033a281ad5.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Adding More Features to the Weather App</em>).</p>
<p>Next, we also need to add the JS file that will be the entry point for our <kbd>WeatherApp.elm</kbd> file. We'll name this JS file similar to <kbd>hello_elm.js</kbd>, meaning we'll separate the words using the underscore character, and we will not capitalize any letters in the filename. So, create a new file inside the <kbd>javascript/packs</kbd> folder and call it <kbd>weather_app.js</kbd>.</p>
<p>Next, add the following code to this new file:</p>
<pre>import Elm from './WeatherApp'<br/><br/>document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () =&gt; {<br/>  const target = document.getElementById('weather-app')<br/><br/>  Elm.WeatherApp.embed(target);<br/>})</pre>
<p>Next, we need to update our <kbd>views/application/index.html.erb</kbd> file by adding the <kbd>javascript_pack_tag</kbd> and passing it a <kbd>div</kbd> with the <kbd>id</kbd> attribute of <kbd>weather-app</kbd>:</p>
<pre>&lt;h1&gt;<br/>  Successfully integrated Elm and Rails!<br/>&lt;/h1&gt;<br/>&lt;%= javascript_pack_tag "weather_app" %&gt;<br/>&lt;div id="weather-app"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br/>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<p>Now, we can restart our Rails server:</p>
<pre>rails s</pre>
<p>Note that, this time, webpacker is going to take quite some time to compile all the newly-added packages (<kbd>Http</kbd>, <kbd>Material</kbd>, and <kbd>Round</kbd>). You should see this message in the console after running the <kbd>rails s</kbd> command:</p>
<pre><strong>rails s</strong><br/><strong>=&gt; Booting Puma</strong><br/><strong>=&gt; Rails 5.1.5 application starting in development</strong><br/><strong>=&gt; Run `rails server -h` for more startup options</strong><br/><strong>Puma starting in single mode...</strong><br/><strong>* Version 3.11.3 (ruby 2.5.0-p0), codename: Love Song</strong><br/><strong>* Min threads: 5, max threads: 5</strong><br/><strong>* Environment: development</strong><br/><strong>* Listening on tcp://0.0.0.0:3000</strong><br/><strong>Use Ctrl-C to stop</strong><br/><strong>Started GET "/" for ......... at 2018-03-10 04:04:30 -0500</strong><br/><strong>Cannot render console from .........!

<p>Finally, after the compilation is complete, we will see this message logged to the console:</p>
<pre><strong>[Webpacker] Compiled all packs in /home/cabox/workspace/simple/public/packs</strong><br/><strong>  Rendered application/index.html.erb within layouts/application (87118.0ms)</strong><br/><strong>Completed 200 OK in 97585ms (Views: 96676.2ms)</strong></pre>
<p>If we open our Rails app in the browser and refresh it, we will see the following web page:</p>
<div><img src="img/9e2957c8-074e-487a-b670-9a05826a00db.png" style="width:24.92em;height:14.08em;"/></div>
<p>As you can see, our Rails-powered website currently has three parts: a static <kbd>h1</kbd> heading and two separate Elm-powered apps, the weather app and the hello app.</p>
<p>This means that we have successfully added two separate Elm apps to our Rails app. This way, we can slowly start introducing Elm widgets to an existing Rails-powered website. This is great if we work in a team of developers who do not know Elm but want to see how it integrates with an existing project and learn from it. Another possible case where this approach would be useful is if the management in our company decides to give Elm a try without going all in.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this chapter, we covered the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting up a basic Rails 5.1.5 app using Codeanywhere</li>
<li>Installing Ruby 2.5.0 and Rails 5.1.5 on Codeanywhere</li>
<li>Creating a brand new Rails project</li>
<li>Integrating Elm with Rails 5.1.5</li>
<li>Adding our Elm weather app to our Rails app</li>
</ul>
<p>Armed with this knowledge, we can start adding standalone Elm-powered modules to our Rails apps.</p>
<p>This brings us to the end of this book. However, your journey with Elm is just beginning. Here are some useful resources if you are interested in learning more about this excellent language (the following links are listed in no particular order):</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Visit elmcasts.com</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>And finally, a brand new project started by the author of this book. A website dedicated to learning Elm.</p>
<p>In the tradition of sites such as <a href="http://railscasts.com">railscasts.com</a> and <a href="http://laracasts.com">laracasts.com</a>, I've decided to name it <a href="http://elmcasts.com"><strong>elmcasts.com</strong></a>. The website should be up and running by the time this book is on the market.</p>
