For this book, we will be using Node.js version 5.0.0. This means that the JavaScript code samples contained within will use ECMAScript 2015 (ES2015, more commonly known as ES6) features, which have been enabled in Node v5.0.0. For a full list of ES6 features enabled in Node.js version 5 and up, visit the Node.js website (<a class="ulink" href="https://nodejs.org/en/docs/es6/">https://nodejs.org/en/docs/es6/</a>).</p><p>This book, its techniques, and the code samples within are OS-agnostic, although for debugging purposes, either the Google Chrome or Opera browser is required.</p></div>
