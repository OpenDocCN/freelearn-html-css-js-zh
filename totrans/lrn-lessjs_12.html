You've spent hours creating your masterpiece, submitted it for approval… only to find that the Sales Director hates your choice of color. He doesn't think it works properly ("there's not enough contrast…"), so it's a case of back to the drawing board. Only you know that he is… shall we say... very picky about his choice of colors, which you know does not always work that well…</p><p class="calibre7">Sound familiar? What if we could pick our main color and have code (yes, code) automatically pick a color for you that not only works technically but also suits your chosen principal color? Sound impossible? Not with Less—welcome to the world of color processing! In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Introducing color management in Less</li><li class="listitem">Color spaces and formats</li><li class="listitem">Color functions</li><li class="listitem">Generating color palettes</li><li class="listitem">Examples of blending modes and parallels with Photoshop</li><li class="listitem">Working with W3C and WCAG standards for color management</li></ul></div><p class="calibre7">Intrigued? Let's start…</p></div>

<em class="calibre9">Printer profiles …colorimeters… sRGB… huh? You're probably a developer, thinking, "I know </em>
<a id="id827" class="calibre1"/>
<em class="calibre9">nothing about color management; what the </em>
<a id="id828" class="calibre1"/>
<em class="calibre9">heck does it all mean?"</em>
</p><p class="calibre7">Well, to put it into context: imagine you've taken a picture of a red flag on a boat (yes, I know, stay with me on this), which appears to take on an orange tone when viewed on screen, but starts to come out purple when printed. Now, I bet you're really confused… let me explain it all.</p><p class="calibre7">This is all about color management. In simple words, it's the art of making sure your printer, camera, and computer all display accurate shades of the same color. This sounds perfectly reasonable, right? After all, all devices should display the same color, no matter the device…</p><p class="calibre7">Wrong. The key to color management is that every device reproduces color differently. In a sense, they all speak different languages and are not as sophisticated as our own eyes; here's where we need that colorimeter to balance everything…!</p><p class="calibre7">Making <a id="id829" class="calibre1"/>sense now? However, where's the link <a id="id830" class="calibre1"/>with Less? Well, it's exactly the same principle in Less—we need to make sure that colors are correctly balanced; it's no good putting blues against purples, as they are too similar. Thankfully, Less has a range of functions that can help us with this. We can choose a primary color, such as purple, then use functions such as <code class="email">darken()</code> or <code class="email">lighten()</code> to choose suitable colors that complement our primary one. Less will then compile this function into valid CSS; for example, if we choose <code class="email">#6600FF</code> (a shade of purple), we can get Less to lighten it by 10 percent to produce <code class="email">#801AFF</code>. This value will then be rendered on screen when Less has compiled your code.</p><p class="calibre7">We will delve into the various functions that Less supports, but for a moment, let's turn our attention to a little theory to help us better understand more about the importance of color formats and spaces.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch12lvl1sec101" class="calibre1"/>Examining color spaces and formats</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">When <a id="id831" class="calibre1"/>we<a id="id832" class="calibre1"/> think of colors, most of us will probably think of red, green, or blue, but do we ever think of color spaces? If the answer is no, then think again; you've just mentioned one of several color spaces we can use.</p><p class="calibre7">Color <a id="id833" class="calibre1"/>spaces are a means of uniquely specifying color. The<a id="id834" class="calibre1"/> most well-known one is <strong class="calibre8">red, green, and blue</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">RGB</strong>). However, others are available, such as <strong class="calibre8">Hue, Saturation, Lightness </strong>(<strong class="calibre8">HSL</strong>), its cousin, which includes alpha support (HSLa) or <strong class="calibre8">HSV</strong> (<strong class="calibre8">Hue, Saturation, and Value</strong>). Less<a id="id835" class="calibre1"/> includes support for these and others; we will look at these in more detail shortly, but first, let's take a look at using basic mathematical operators to create new colors.</p></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_1"><a id="ch12lvl2sec93" class="calibre1"/>Working with arithmetic operators</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">How <a id="id836" class="calibre1"/>often have you spent hours fine-tuning a<a id="id837" class="calibre1"/> palette for a client, only to find they want to change the whole lot? It will be impossible to simply change one color, you will need to change them all…</p><p class="calibre7">We can use Less to help us with this. It contains support for a number of functions that we can use to automate the creation and manipulation of colors. We can pick the red, blue, or green shades from colors, or use HSL to get the hue, lightness, or saturation levels <a id="id838" class="calibre1"/>from a color. However, we can also<a id="id839" class="calibre1"/> do something that you might not expect to see, but which makes perfect sense: use simple math operators, such as <code class="email">+</code> or <code class="email">–</code> to create our colors.</p><p class="calibre7">Try this little experiment. If you have installed Crunch!, then add this to a new file within, and save it:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">@basecolor: #333;
.container {
  color: @basecolor *2;
  background-color: @basecolor - #111;
}</pre></div><p class="calibre7">When compiled, we get two colors, generated from one base color:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">.container { color: #666666; background-color: #222222; }</pre></div><p class="calibre7">This compiled line <a id="id840" class="calibre1"/>of code gives us….a very dark gray, and…another<a id="id841" class="calibre1"/> dark gray. Not quite the colors I had in mind, but hey, it shows the principle very well; we can easily create multiple colors from one single base color. The key to it is to ensure that we get the right balance of numbers, in terms of base colors against those we calculate using operators. Let's see whether we can improve on this, and start exploring the world of functions to create some more appealing colors.</p></div></div>

It is worth taking the time to familiarize yourself with the options available, particularly as it is possible to produce the same color using different methods!</p><p class="calibre7">The functions can be split into four groups—they cover color definition, channels, operations, and blending. Let's take a look at each group of functions in turn, starting with defining color formats.</p></div>

Less provides a number of methods to obtain colors using different formats, and these are the three that you will likely use the most:</p><div><table border="1" class="calibre15"><colgroup class="calibre16"><col class="calibre17"/><col class="calibre17"/><col class="calibre17"/></colgroup><thead class="calibre18"><tr class="calibre19"><th valign="bottom" class="calibre20">

Instead, we can choose our master color, assign it to a variable, and use functions to generate the remaining colors.

Let's say we<a id="id887" class="calibre1"/> have a number of text styles on our site, which use <a id="id888" class="calibre1"/>different shades of the same color.</p><p class="calibre7">We could <a id="id889" class="calibre1"/>easily set the colors within our CSS, but this would miss out on a major key part of Less; why set them explicitly, when we can get Less to do this for us? To see what this means, let's knock up a quick demo that creates some different styles for the standard <code class="email">H1</code> to <code class="email">H6</code> markup as shown here:</p><div><img src="img/00117.jpeg" alt="Making text darker or lighter in color" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">Let's start:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem" value="1">For this demo, we need to download a copy of the code that accompanies this book.

With a little work and one single color, we've set all of the styles automatically, using Less. Our demo is creating the styles dynamically, but we can easily precompile the Less statements into valid CSS code, and use this instead. All we need to do is just use the right <code class="email">H</code> attribute when designing our pages!</p><p class="calibre7">Let's move on now and take a look at some more of the functions of Less that we can use—the blending group. These functions work in a similar fashion to those options available within<a id="id890" class="calibre1"/> graphics packages<a id="id891" class="calibre1"/> such <a id="id892" class="calibre1"/>as Photoshop or GIMP.

<div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_1"><a id="ch12lvl2sec97" class="calibre1"/>Comparing Less with Photoshop</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">Working <a id="id898" class="calibre1"/>with blend modes in CSS is<a id="id899" class="calibre1"/> likely to raise a very important point—how does<a id="id900" class="calibre1"/> Less stack up against applications such as Photoshop?</p><p class="calibre7">Well, the good news is that for those already familiar with blend modes in Photoshop, the same values exist within Less, although the range is not as extensive as Photoshop. We can use values such as lighten, darken, hardlight, and so on, to produce similar effects to creating images in Photoshop.</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="tip28" class="calibre1"/>Tip</h3><p class="calibre7">Two good <a id="id901" class="calibre1"/>examples of how we can use blending modes can be found at <a class="calibre1" href="http://css-tricks.com/basics-css-blend-modes/">http://css-tricks.com/basics-css-blend-modes/</a>; have a look also at <a class="calibre1" href="http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/photoshop-ccs-blending-modes.html">http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/photoshop-ccs-blending-modes.html</a> to get a feel for how these modes fit in with the other blend modes available in the latest version of Photoshop (CC at the time of writing this).</p></div><p class="calibre7">The downside is that support for blend modes is still very new; for example, support for <code class="email">background-blend-mode</code> (at the time of writing this) is limited to the latest versions of modern browsers, with the exception of IE.</p><p class="calibre7">This limitation aside, it is definitely worth spending time getting familiar with how we can replicate the same effects from Photoshop within Less/CSS. As we've already seen, there are a host of blend values we can use. As a tester of what is possible using CSS, have a look at the excellent gradients produced by Bennett Feely, which use <code class="email">background-blend-mode</code>. You can <a id="id902" class="calibre1"/>see the gradients at <a class="calibre1" href="http://bennettfeely.com/gradients/">http://bennettfeely.com/gradients/</a>.</p><p class="calibre7">To really get a feel of how we can use blend modes in Less, it is strongly recommended that you understand at least these three: <code class="email">screen</code>, <code class="email">multiply</code>, and <code class="email">overlay</code>. The others will follow in due course. Let's take a moment to cover these three modes in more detail:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><code class="email">Screen</code>: This <a id="id903" class="calibre1"/>ignores blacks and makes images appear lighter with light tones appearing washed out.</li><li class="listitem"><code class="email">Multiply</code>: This<a id="id904" class="calibre1"/> is the direct opposite, with darker tones reinforced, while light will pass through anything that is clear or bright.</li><li class="listitem"><code class="email">Overlay</code>: This is a balance between screen and multiply; it ignores midtones, making the <a id="id905" class="calibre1"/>blended result lighter and darker at the same time, to increase contrast.</li></ul></div><p class="calibre7">Let's change tack at this point and move on. We can easily use blend modes to help produce new colors, or interesting effects (particularly with images!); this won't be truly effective unless we've worked out what our site's palette will look like.</p><p class="calibre7">It's at<a id="id906" class="calibre1"/> this point we can really put Less<a id="id907" class="calibre1"/> to good use, in calculating suitable values for <a id="id908" class="calibre1"/>our palette. Before we do so, let's begin with a primer on creating successful palettes to help set the scene.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch12lvl1sec104" class="calibre1"/>Introducing palettes</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">We all work <a id="id909" class="calibre1"/>with colors as part of designing a site. Colors are key to making or breaking our design. The creation of a cohesive and interesting website relies on the right choice of colors that form our palette. Historically, we frequently used either a white or color background; as our tastes have evolved, so has the need to choose the right colors to form our palette.</p><p class="calibre7">The key to any successful palette, and that is even before we get into the depths of producing it, is to really understand how color works. The theory of color is a complex subject, where we can get to grips with understanding how different shades and hues interact with each other and the effect this has on the visitor to the site.</p><p class="calibre7">To help us<a id="id910" class="calibre1"/> through the minefield of choosing the right colors to create our palette, there are a number of tips we can use:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Try to choose a palette type that creates suitable colors, based on a color of your choice. There are several palette types available, but three of particular note are Analogous, Complementary, and Triadic.</li><li class="listitem">Instead, choose colors based on current trends. This might, for example, be muted pastel colors, which have become popular in producing soothing, flat designs.</li><li class="listitem">An alternative is to use bright colors, which are usually heavily saturated, to make elements really stand out. The range of colors is often limited, with lots of white or gray space, to help equalize the stark colors used in this palette.</li><li class="listitem">We can even go for a monochromatic design, which is often based around shades of black or gray, with specific elements highlighted in reds or blues. Monochrome palettes help convey an emotional or psychological message, whereas we can use an accent color to highlight important elements in the design.<div><h3 class="title2"><a id="note59" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre7">A great tool to use when choosing colors is Adobe's Kuler, which is available at <a class="calibre1" href="https://kuler.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/">https://kuler.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/</a>. It shows some other <a id="id911" class="calibre1"/>palettes that you can use, such as Triad or Compound; it is worth trying these once you've become familiar with creating palettes.</p></div></li></ul></div><p class="calibre7">Let's take a moment now to look at some of these palette types in more detail.</p></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_1"><a id="ch12lvl2sec98" class="calibre1"/>Analyzing color palette examples</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">It is<a id="id912" class="calibre1"/> surprising how consumers can frequently<a id="id913" class="calibre1"/> be guided by the colors used on a website; for example, a study found that between 60-80 percent of customers' purchasing decisions are influenced solely by color! Let's take a moment to consider a couple of examples to show the importance of choosing the right colors.</p><p class="calibre7">Trüf, a Los Angeles-based web design company, uses a monochromatic design, with red to highlight<a id="id914" class="calibre1"/> critical elements of their site—you can see their design at <a class="calibre1" href="http://www.trufcreative.com">http://www.trufcreative.com</a>.</p><p class="calibre7">A similar use <a id="id915" class="calibre1"/>of colors, but for a different site, Etch uses various shades in its bold background, with pink elements to make the design really stand out. Their site is at <a class="calibre1" href="http://www.etchapps.com">http://www.etchapps.com</a>.</p><p class="calibre7">To get a feel for the importance of choosing colors well, take a look at the infographic on Column Five Media's site, at <a class="calibre1" href="http://www.columnfivemedia.com/work-items/infographic-true-colors-what-your-brand-colors-say-about-your-business">http://www.columnfivemedia.com/work-items/infographic-true-colors-what-your-brand-colors-say-about-your-business</a>; there are some very revealing facts!</p><p class="calibre7">It is worth noting though that accessibility must be considered where practical; this will often be determined by the appeal of the product or service on offer to visually impaired visitors; Geri Coady has produced a useful guide in the form of an e-book, which is available for sale at <a class="calibre1" href="http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/products/colour-accessibility">http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/products/colour-accessibility</a>.</p><p class="calibre7">Let's move on now and turn our attention to what we've been waiting for—choosing some colors.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_2"><a id="ch12lvl2sec99" class="calibre1"/>Choosing our colors</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">So far, we've<a id="id916" class="calibre1"/> learned about the importance of choosing our colors<a id="id917" class="calibre1"/> carefully and the impact this will have on our site's visitors; getting it wrong will be disastrous! In comparison, once we know which colors we want to use, creating our palette is really easy.</p><p class="calibre7">The first stage is to choose our primary color. Column Five Media's infographic suggests that only 5 percent of the world's top 100 brands use more than two colors; the key here is to use as many colors as is suitable for your project. A good rule of thumb is to choose at least 2-3 colors to work with, alongside a neutral light or dark color for the background. We<a id="id918" class="calibre1"/> can then use Less to produce any shade <a id="id919" class="calibre1"/>needed from your choice of principal colors.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_3"><a id="ch12lvl2sec100" class="calibre1"/>Using a photo as our source</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">How <a id="id920" class="calibre1"/>often <a id="id921" class="calibre1"/>have you wondered where you will get that inspiration for a design? I'll bet the answer is frequently, and I'm willing to bet that photos will feature somewhere in this list of sources!</p><p class="calibre7">Photos are perfect as a source of inspiration. We can pick a principal color from it, then manually choose colors that would work. It can be a little hit and miss though; not every color scheme will work, but the key to using this method is experimenting until you find colors that would provide a good harmony in your design.</p><p class="calibre7">We can take a more pragmatic route though. Adobe released Kuler, a brilliant app (and website), to help choose suitable colors according to the type of palette we use.</p><p class="calibre7">We can either choose a color, then get Kuler to choose appropriate colors for us, or we can upload a photo of our choice and select suitable colors from it. In the following screenshot, we can see the results of selecting a color from a photo, such as the one used in my first book, <em class="calibre9">jQuery Tools UI Library</em>, published by <em class="calibre9">Packt Publishing</em>.</p><div><img src="img/00118.jpeg" alt="Using a photo as our source" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">In comparison, if we take the purple from far left (<code class="email">#a67097</code>) and use it in Kuler's color wheel, we get a completely different result, using the Analogous palette:</p><div><img src="img/00119.jpeg" alt="Using a photo as our source" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre7">It really <a id="id922" class="calibre1"/>comes down to what your project needs in terms <a id="id923" class="calibre1"/>of color; to help with this and understand the impact on your visitors, it is worth reading an article by Rachel Shillcock, on Tuts+, at <a class="calibre1" href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/understanding-the-qualities-and-characteristics-of-color--webdesign-13292">http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/understanding-the-qualities-and-characteristics-of-color--webdesign-13292</a>.</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="tip29" class="calibre1"/>Tip</h3><p class="calibre7">For a good <a id="id924" class="calibre1"/>source of inspiration, take a look at the palettes created on Kuler by others; they are at <a class="calibre1" href="https://kuler.adobe.com/explore/newest/">https://kuler.adobe.com/explore/newest/</a>.</p></div><p class="calibre7">Choosing a color using a tool, such as Kuler, can be an interesting experience. It opens up a world of possibilities, although one person's idea of harmony might not align with others! Choices, choices…</p><p class="calibre7">To help take some of the guesswork out of creating palettes, we can easily use the power of Less to create a suitable palette, based on our choice of color. Let's take a look at how this will work in practice.</p></div></div>

There are no hard and fast rules on format, but consistency and reuse is very much the order of the day!</p></div><p class="calibre7">So, we've seen how easy it is to produce color palettes and that Jimmy's tool makes it a cinch to <a id="id936" class="calibre1"/>get<a id="id937" class="calibre1"/> the <a id="id938" class="calibre1"/>all-important calculations needed to create each color. This gives me an idea… what if we were to ditch Photoshop and design in the browser instead?</p></div></div>

No—that would be absolutely impossible, I hear you say! We can't do that…</p><p class="calibre7">Or can we…? Well, surprising as it might sound, it is perfectly possible; what's more, Less can help<a id="id939" class="calibre1"/> make this a painless process. Let me explain.</p><p class="calibre7">Historically, designers<a id="id940" class="calibre1"/> and developers have relied on using Photoshop to create mockups of sites. "Nothing wrong in this", I hear you say. However, it doubles the work; clients can't use the design to see how it looks and works, and changes cannot be made on the fly. Also, Photoshop is expensive. We need a high-end PC or Mac just to get the full benefit from using it; can developers working on small sites, where costs are a concern, really justify the cost?</p><p class="calibre7">In contrast, designing straight into the browser makes the process more dynamic; we can make changes quickly and easily, particularly if Less has been used! We can even produce several style sheets that can completely alter the appearance of a site with just a few clicks; creating designs in Photoshop means recreating the base view from the ground up for each subsequent design. With the best will in the world, there is always a risk that each design will have some slight differences, despite following the same process in each case!</p><p class="calibre7">However, we should not forget that the real key to design is actually not to concentrate on the color, but the content first. If we get that right, then the colors will fall easily into place.</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="note61" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre7">To help get the feel of the mindset of designing in the browser, Creative Bloq has published an interview with web developer, Sean Fioritto, which is available at <a class="calibre1" href="http://www.creativebloq.com/css3/why-web-developers-should-sketch-css-not-photoshop-51411711">http://www.creativebloq.com/css3/why-web-developers-should-sketch-css-not-photoshop-51411711</a>. This makes for an interesting <a id="id941" class="calibre1"/>read!</p></div><p class="calibre7">If, however, we really cannot afford to stop using Photoshop, then we can at least make our development workflow smarter. CSS Hat has made a plugin that can convert any design into the<a id="id942" class="calibre1"/> equivalent Less code and export them as Less files. It's available at <a class="calibre1" href="http://www.csshat.com">http://www.csshat.com</a>, and versions are available for both Windows and Mac with licenses priced at 35 USD for both versions.</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="note62" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre7">To see it in action, Kezz Bacey has written a two-part tutorial that shows how easy it is to use the plugin to produce Less code; part 1 of the tutorial is available at <a class="calibre1" href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-improve-your-photoshop-workflow-with-csshat-and-pnghat--cms-20786">http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-improve-your-photoshop-workflow-with-csshat-and-pnghat--cms-20786</a> and part 2 at <a class="calibre1" href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-code-a-photoshop-layout-with-csshat-lesshat-and-pnghat--cms-20997">http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-code-a-photoshop-layout-with-csshat-lesshat-and-pnghat--cms-20997</a>.</p></div><p class="calibre7">We're almost<a id="id943" class="calibre1"/> at the end of our mini journey of working <a id="id944" class="calibre1"/>with colors in Less. Before we finish and move to look at animation in the next chapter, we need to take a look at some legal requirements that every designer should consider within their designs. This is, of course, the WCAG standards; let's take a look at these in more detail.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_6"><a id="ch12lvl2sec103" class="calibre1"/>Working with W3C and WCAG standards</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">Throughout this <a id="id945" class="calibre1"/>chapter, we've been on a journey<a id="id946" class="calibre1"/> of discovery, seeing how various<a id="id947" class="calibre1"/> different functions within Less can help simplify the <a id="id948" class="calibre1"/>work required to create new colors. There is one important part of creating colors that we have yet to cover  and which designers must be aware of: the need to ensure compliance with the WCAG guidelines for accessibility.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_7"><a id="ch12lvl2sec104" class="calibre1"/>Overcoming blocks on access to a site</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">In <a id="id949" class="calibre1"/>this modern age, one would hope that all sites <a id="id950" class="calibre1"/>would be accessible to everyone; the truth is that this is not always the case. Access can be blocked for a number of reasons, and in terms of color, they are:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Visitors who cannot differentiate between particular colors and therefore can't access information that relies on the use of those colors to convey meaning (for example, red/green color blindness)</li><li class="listitem">Visitors<a id="id951" class="calibre1"/> who need to use devices <a id="id952" class="calibre1"/>that can't display information that uses color</li><li class="listitem">Visitors with color deficiencies, who struggle to see sites that have foreground and background colors that are very close in hue</li></ul></div><p class="calibre7">So, how can we get around these issues and ensure we produce a site that is accessible?</p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_8"><a id="ch12lvl2sec105" class="calibre1"/>Introducing WCAG</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">WCAG has<a id="id953" class="calibre1"/> compiled <a id="id954" class="calibre1"/>an extensive list of guidelines to help guide designers through ensuring compliance, which can be viewed at <a class="calibre1" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/">http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/</a>. These need to be followed, although designers can opt to choose<a id="id955" class="calibre1"/> compliance at either A, Double-A, or Triple-A grade levels.</p><p class="calibre7">The WCAG <a id="id956" class="calibre1"/>recommendations make for dry reading, and there are, nevertheless, two key factors to consider, which in summary are:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Colors should not be used as the only means of conveying any information; a green button marked <strong class="calibre8">OK</strong> is preferable to a simple green circle</li><li class="listitem">Text (and images of text) should have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except when large-scale text is used, or the text forms part of a decorative image or brand logo</li></ul></div><p class="calibre7">To ensure that information is not likely to fall foul of WCAG compliance, we can use several guidelines:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Avoid using colored text or strong background colors</li><li class="listitem">Black text on white background is recommended (avoid using underlined text as your customers might think the text is a hyperlink when it is not)</li><li class="listitem">Use standard fonts (for example, Arial, Times New Roman)</li><li class="listitem">Uppercase text should not be used for entire page headings or blocks of text</li></ul></div><p class="calibre7">In addition, we can use a number of tools to help us decide whether we have the right contrast levels. Two<a id="id957" class="calibre1"/> such examples are available at <a class="calibre1" href="http://www.dasplankton.de/ContrastA/">http://www.dasplankton.de/ContrastA/</a> and <a class="calibre1" href="http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/</a>.</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="note63" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre7">There are plenty of resources available online for further reading, including case examples and guidelines issued for specific companies or government organizations. Some examples include:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><a class="calibre1" href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/">http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/</a></li><li class="listitem"><a class="calibre1" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/">http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/</a></li><li class="listitem"><a class="calibre1" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/">http://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/</a></li></ul></div></div><p class="calibre7">It is worth noting that the Less library has been modified to help compliance. Although it is not completely compliant yet, one example of change to help towards compliance is the pull request issued at <a class="calibre1" href="https://github.com/less/less.js/pull/1704">https://github.com/less/less.js/pull/1704</a>; this deals with changes made to color functions within Less, such as multiply or overlay.</p></div></div>

While researching for this book, I came across a brilliant discussion on Stack Overflow, which talks about ensuring compliance to the WCAG guidelines and why adhering to them can actually be detrimental to your site.</p><p class="calibre7">In a nutshell, the responder to the original question discusses the good work being done by the team behind the guidelines even though they are not perfect. He talks about the need to apply the guidelines with care and that only those that best suit a website should be used. He mentions that many people with disabilities will often find ways around information that is otherwise hidden from view, and that in some respects, they are the perfect individuals to help test the usability of a site!</p><div><h3 class="title2"><a id="note64" class="calibre1"/>Note</h3><p class="calibre7">You<a id="id960" class="calibre1"/> can read the full discussion at <a class="calibre1" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21415785/wcag-vs-real-users-opinions">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21415785/wcag-vs-real-users-opinions</a>.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_0"><a id="ch12lvl1sec105" class="calibre1"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre7">Color management in Less can be seen as something of a paradox; while the tools are relatively simple to use, they can be used to produce complex designs that are only limited by the bounds of your imagination. Throughout this chapter, we've covered a number of tools that you can use to extract, mix, and blend colors. Let's take a moment to review what we have learned throughout this chapter.</p><p class="calibre7">We began with a little theory to set the scene and introduce color management; we also learned a little about color spaces and formats. Our delve into using Less began with a look at using simple arithmetic operators such as multiplication or division; this was swiftly followed by an introduction to the various color functions available in Less and how these functions compared to working with Photoshop.</p><p class="calibre7">Next up was an introduction to palettes and an analysis of some examples, to illustrate the importance of choosing colors carefully. This included using photos as a potential color source, which we then used to create a color palette using Less.</p><p class="calibre7">Next up came something that some might see as controversial, which was a look at ditching old habits and moving to using something like Less to develop straight into the browser. While some may argue this is not sensible, we covered some of the reasons why this practice might turn out to be beneficial; for those who couldn't face the move, we looked at a simple way of getting the Less styles created automatically from Photoshop. To close out the chapter, we took a look at how developers must adhere to the WCAG guidelines on the use of color, why they were devised, and how we need to be careful in applying them to our sites.</p><p class="calibre7">Phew! We certainly covered a lot! Let's move onto our next chapter, which will take a look at how we can use Less to simplify development of animation within our projects.</p></div></body></html>
