    a bit more robust. By using Sencha Touch Charts, we can also display complex graphical

    Our overall details view will contain three similar charts and a radar chart.
    Since we don't want to create the same chart over and over, we need a view we
    can call up with a different configuration for each of our charts. This will be
    a simple bar style chart with two axes; one for the date and one for the amount.

    the panel using `Ext.apply(this, config);`. This is where we will set an individual
    `title`, `dataField`, `goalField`, and `colorSet` for each chart.
