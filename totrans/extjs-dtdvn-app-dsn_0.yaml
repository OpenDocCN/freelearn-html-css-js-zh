- en: Ext JS is a leading JavaScript framework that comes with a wealth of components,
    APIs, and extensive documentation that you can harness to build powerful and interactive
    desktop applications. By using Ext JS, you also quickly develop rich desktop web
    applications that are compatible with all major browsers. This book will take
    you step-by-step through building a clear and user-friendly sales database in
    Ext JS using information from an existing database.

    the book you will have a working application that is ready to customize. You can

    improve maintenance, and expand applications with ease.
