<h1 class="chapterTitle" id="_idParaDest-138">Using Text and Balloon Tools</h1>
<p class="normal">One of the brilliant things about manga and comic creations is you can make your characters have dialog! Lettering for this media can be a complex and nuanced topic that could fill an entire book of its own. The rules and conventions for lettering a comic are varied, and lettering in and of itself is a skill that takes lots of time and practice to master. Back in the days before computers, a comic would have a dedicated letterer who would draw all the dialog boxes, balloons, and words by hand using various tools. Thankfully, we can use Clip Studio Paint and the fonts installed on our computer to handle lettering, rather than having to draw every letter on our own!</p>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we will take this basic theory of speech in comics and learn how to apply it using the Text and Balloon tools in Clip Studio Paint. Since Clip Studio is made for comic book artists, it naturally has tools to make the creation of speech balloons easy, as well as tools to create different balloon tails, and more.</p>
<p class="normal">The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList">The basic theory of speech bubbles</li>
<li class="bulletList">Text tool basics</li>
<li class="bulletList">Advanced text settings</li>
<li class="bulletList">Creating custom text tools</li>
<li class="bulletList">Making and editing speech balloons</li>
<li class="bulletList">Connecting speech balloons</li>
<li class="bulletList">Using speech balloon materials</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Let’s get started!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-139">Technical requirements</h1>
<p class="normal">To get started, you need Clip Studio Paint already installed on your device and a new canvas open, and preferably, one character should already be drawn on it. Any size is fine, but I recommend creating a 300 dpi square canvas to go through the content in this chapter.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-140">The basic theory of speech bubbles</h1>
<p class="normal">Before we learn how to<a id="_idIndexMarker524"/> create speech bubbles, let’s think a little about where<a id="_idIndexMarker525"/> to place them.</p>
<p class="normal">It is important to consider speech bubbles and text boxes as part of a manga panel and its composition on a page. Even as early as the sketching stage, we need to think of these elements as part of the composition along with the characters and environment.</p>
<p class="normal">This means that, first of all, the text (and the panels they are a part of) must be in an order that’s easy to follow. This may seem obvious, but it makes a big difference to how people read your comic. Who is replying to who? Are the characters speaking before, during, or after the action shown in the artwork? Is it clear, from one panel to another, how much time has passed? Reading is, after all, a linear experience, and it’s important that we handle the flow of information to the reader effectively.</p>
<p class="normal">Perhaps more important, though, is to consider the impact of text boxes and balloons on a composition as a whole. The text must be placed <em class="italic">around </em>the center of the piece, rather than in the middle of it.</p>
<p class="normal">With these two aspects in mind – the sequence of the dialog and its incorporation into the composition – we should look at some examples. The following samples show text in a Western comic on the left and Japanese manga on the right:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_07_7.1.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.1: A sketch and a manga page with text</p>
<p class="normal">You can see from these examples that the placement of text boxes is influenced by the direction of reading – from left to right in the Western comic and from right to left in the Japanese manga. In both cases, the boxes generally flow from top to bottom and<a id="_idIndexMarker526"/> are near the character who is speaking. In neither <a id="_idIndexMarker527"/>case, however, do they overlap with important parts of the art piece.</p>
<p class="normal">Generally, text boxes are for announcements and speech balloons are for character dialog. For example, you may have seen text boxes used to announce details like the passage of time from one panel to another. As we can see in the left example, announcements about the passage of time are typically placed in the corners of the composition.</p>
<p class="normal">Speech balloons can be created using different shapes, depending on the tones and pacing of the dialog. In the previous examples, the character’s pondering in the Western comic is shown with round bubbles with small tails. In comparison, the action-packed manga uses zig-zagging shapes and larger text.</p>
<p class="normal">Now, let’s start <a id="_idIndexMarker528"/>learning how to create these balloons.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-141">The basics of the Text tool</h1>
<p class="normal">In this section, we’re<a id="_idIndexMarker529"/> going to learn the basics of how to use the <a id="_idIndexMarker530"/>Text tools and their basic settings, before building on our knowledge in the sections that follow. Let’s add some text to a drawing using the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Open a blank canvas or a drawing to add some text to.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Choose the <strong class="screenText">Text</strong> category of the tools from the toolbar.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Make sure that the <strong class="screenText">Text</strong> subcategory is chosen in the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> palette.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Select the <strong class="screenText">Text</strong> tool.</li>
<li class="numberedList">In the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette, select the desired font from the drop-down menu. This menu will populate with fonts that have been installed on your computer system.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Select the size of the font by using the slider or the up and down arrows.</li>
<li class="numberedList">The alignment of the text (left, center, or right) can be set in the Justify section of the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Set <strong class="screenText">Text Direction</strong> to either Horizontal or Vertical.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Set <strong class="screenText">Text Color</strong> using the options shown. <strong class="screenText">Text Color</strong> can either be the currently selected main color, the currently selected sub color, or a user color.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on the canvas where you’d like to place the text, and type out your desired dialog or words.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">Figure 7.2 shows a panel from my manga<em class="italic"> </em>with the dialog text added.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_07_7.2.png"/> </figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.2: A comic panel with text</p>
<p class="normal">The text in the screenshot on the left is center justified and set at a size of 9.0 points. Depending on the font you use, as well as your style of writing and art, a larger or smaller size may be more appropriate for you. However, keep readability in mind, as you don’t want to make your words so small that they are illegible! If you are<a id="_idIndexMarker531"/> posting your comic to the internet and also <a id="_idIndexMarker532"/>printing it, make sure to check that your text is legible in both formats. Sometimes, text that is legible in print can become illegible on the internet.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Once your text is typed out, you can resize it on the fly by using the control boxes around the text. In the preceding screenshot, they are the circular and rectangular handles around the outside of the box surrounding the text. Clicking and dragging on one of these boxes will make the text inside larger or smaller.</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Those are the basic controls to make words in Clip Studio Paint. In the next section, we will <a id="_idIndexMarker533"/>take a deeper look at the text settings to make<a id="_idIndexMarker534"/> finer adjustments to things such as line and character spacing.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-142">Exploring advanced text settings</h1>
<p class="normal">In some cases, you may <a id="_idIndexMarker535"/>need to adjust parts of the font <a id="_idIndexMarker536"/>that you use. Whether that is the spacing between individual characters or the spacing between lines of text, Clip Studio Paint gives you options to fine-tune your fonts to perfection. Whether letters look too condensed together or the lines seem too close, you just need to use the following settings to deal with them. Any settings I think important are marked as <strong class="screenText">Important</strong>, which are <strong class="screenText">Font</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Font size</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Alignmen</strong>t, and <strong class="screenText">Text color</strong>. Let’s look at these settings now. To access the settings, open the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool Detail</strong> palette from the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette in the user interface.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-143">Editing properties settings</h2>
<p class="normal">The left-hand side <a id="_idIndexMarker537"/>of the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool Detail</strong> palette <a id="_idIndexMarker538"/>contains categories of options. Each added category contains options for whether the changes in the <strong class="screenText">Tool Property</strong> palette apply to new or selected text. Figure 7.3 shows this category of <strong class="screenText">Editing properties</strong> options.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_07_7.3.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.3: Editing properties options in the Text tool’s Sub Tool Detail palette</p>
<p class="normal">Sometimes, you may want to change a font or the size of letters of only the new text without altering the existing text in the same sentence. The <strong class="screenText">Editing properties</strong> option deals with this issue! When you select <strong class="screenText">New Only</strong>, changes in <strong class="screenText">the Tool Property</strong> will not affect any selected text. It is useful when you want to emphasize only<a id="_idIndexMarker539"/> some parts of the text in<a id="_idIndexMarker540"/> the same speech balloon/text box. When set to <strong class="screenText">Selected text</strong>, the properties will apply to new and selected text. Normally, I set it as <strong class="screenText">Selected text.</strong></p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-144">Operation settings</h2>
<p class="normal">The second <a id="_idIndexMarker541"/>category is <strong class="screenText">Operation</strong> settings. This<a id="_idIndexMarker542"/> is also a very useful new function. These settings let you decide how to operate previously typed-in text. Figure 7.4 shows the <strong class="screenText">Operation</strong> settings options.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_07_7.4.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.4: Operation options in the Text tool’s Sub Tool Detail palette</p>
<p class="normal">The first <strong class="screenText">Operation</strong> option is <strong class="screenText">Drag</strong>, which allows you to decide whether you want to create a text box.</p>
<p class="normal">If you select <strong class="screenText">Create text box</strong> from the drop-down menu, a text box with word wrapping is created. Word wrapping is a great new function to align text inside a created frame! When the option is set to <strong class="screenText">Select text</strong>, any text in the area will be selected to drag around on the canvas. When set to <strong class="screenText">None</strong>, either of the above options <a id="_idIndexMarker543"/>are <a id="_idIndexMarker544"/>applied. I normally set this as <strong class="screenText">None</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-145">Font settings</h2>
<p class="normal">This category<a id="_idIndexMarker545"/> contains options for the font and size<a id="_idIndexMarker546"/> of characters, word and character spacing, and the style of the font.</p>
<p class="normal">Figure 7.5 shows this category of font options and the following list describes each of those options:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_07_7.5.png"/></figure>

<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Font (important)</strong>:<strong class="screenText"> </strong>This drop-down menu lists the currently selected font. This list is populated with fonts that have been installed on your computer’s operating system.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Mixing font</strong>: This option is used mainly when mixing Japanese and Chinese characters with English characters, so we will not use it in this book.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Size </strong>(important): Sets the size of the font.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Horizontal ratio</strong>: This option sets the horizontal spread of the letters, making them wider or thinner.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Vertical ratio</strong>: Use this option to control the vertical ratio of the font, making the letters taller or shorter.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Kerning</strong>: sets the spacing between kerning pairs. When you select <strong class="screenText">Manual</strong> from the drop-down menu, you can adjust the spacing of chosen kerning pairs by setting a number. Selecting <strong class="screenText">Matrix</strong> will automatically adjust the spacing of specific kerning pairs based on the font information. If there is no information in the font, the characters will be spaced as standard.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Character spacing</strong>: Adjusts the spacing between the letters of the font.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Condense text</strong>: Specifies the ratio of the gap on either side of each character.</li>

<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Outline</strong>: Turns the font into an outline-only font, where the letters are not filled in with a solid color.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Ligatures</strong>: Turns ligatures on or off. It’s a niche feature. The only likely use that you’ll <a id="_idIndexMarker547"/>encounter is needing to<a id="_idIndexMarker548"/> turn ligatures off because small letters stick together and are illegible when printed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-146">Line space/alignment settings</h2>
<p class="normal">The fourth <a id="_idIndexMarker549"/>category<a id="_idIndexMarker550"/> of options in the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool Detail</strong> palette is <strong class="screenText">Line space/alignment</strong>, which gives you control over editing lines. This category of options is shown in Figure 7.6.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_07_7.6.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.6: Line spacing options in the Text tool’s Sub Tool Detail palette</p>
<p class="normal">These settings are<a id="_idIndexMarker551"/> described in the <a id="_idIndexMarker552"/>following bulleted list:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Alignment </strong>(important): Set the alignment of the lines of text to <strong class="screenText">Left</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Center</strong>, or <strong class="screenText">Right</strong>.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Wrap text at frame</strong>: By ticking this box, text will wrap within the frame. When it’s off, the size of the frame will adjust to fit the text.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Justify</strong>: Aligns text so that it aligns with both sides of the text box. This setting is only available when <strong class="screenText">Wrap text at frame</strong> is turned on.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Position in frame</strong>: Sets where the text is placed inside the frame. This setting is only available when <strong class="screenText">Wrap text at frame</strong> is turned on.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Line space</strong>: Adjusts line space by length when selecting <strong class="screenText">Length</strong> in <strong class="screenText">How to specify</strong>, but by percentage when selecting <strong class="screenText">Percentage</strong> in <strong class="screenText">How to specify</strong>.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">How to specify</strong>: This drop-down menu controls how to specify the <strong class="screenText">Line space</strong> option. It can be set to either <strong class="screenText">Specify length</strong> or <strong class="screenText">By percentage</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Now, you<a id="_idIndexMarker553"/> know how to edit <a id="_idIndexMarker554"/>lines. Next, we are going to explore more detailed settings of text appearances.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-147">Text settings</h2>
<p class="normal">In this section, we <a id="_idIndexMarker555"/>will look at the <strong class="screenText">Text</strong> category, which grants <a id="_idIndexMarker556"/>us control over even more detailed settings, such as text directions and background colors. Figure 7.7 shows the <strong class="screenText">Text</strong> category of the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool Detail</strong> palette.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_07_7.7.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.7: Text options in the Text tool’s Sub Tool Detail palette</p>
<p class="normal">Each of the <strong class="screenText">Text</strong> settings is described in the following list:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Text direction</strong>: Sets the text direction to either <strong class="screenText">Horizontal</strong> or <strong class="screenText">Vertical</strong>.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Anti-aliasing</strong>: Sets the anti-aliasing used for text. The options are <strong class="screenText">Canvas setting</strong>, <strong class="screenText">On</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Off</strong>.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Auto TateChuYoko (Horizontal in Vertical)</strong>: Sets how many consecutive half-width characters to show automatically in <strong class="screenText">TateChuYoko</strong> (Horizontal in Vertical). It only applies to the Japanese language, so we can skip this.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Use half-width punctuation marks</strong>: Having this checkbox selected uses punctuation marks that are half the width of the normal size, which is only effective in languages that use two-byte characters, such as Japanese.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Edge</strong>: Adds an outline around the selected text. The thickness of the outline can be controlled using the slider that is activated after the checkbox is clicked.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Edge color</strong>: Allows the user to select the color of the edge outline. Click on the rectangle to the right of the option name to select the color.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Background color</strong>: Sets a background color around the text.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Opacity</strong>: Controls the opacity of the background color.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">In the next section, we will look at <strong class="screenText">Edit</strong> <strong class="screenText">settings</strong>, skipping the <strong class="screenText">Reading</strong> settings, as they<a id="_idIndexMarker557"/> are <a id="_idIndexMarker558"/>specifically made for Japanese comics. <strong class="screenText">Edit</strong> <strong class="screenText">settings</strong> lets you decide the text color and which layer to add text to.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-148">Edit settings</h2>
<p class="normal">In this section, we<a id="_idIndexMarker559"/> will look at the text color <a id="_idIndexMarker560"/>settings and which layer to add text to. Figure 7.8 shows the <strong class="screenText">Edit</strong> <strong class="screenText">settings</strong> category of the <strong class="screenText">Text</strong> options:</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_07_7.8.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.8: Edit settings options in the Text tool’s Sub Tool Detail palette</p>
<p class="normal">The following explains these options:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Text color (</strong>important<strong class="screenText">)</strong>: Controls the text color by setting it to either the main color, sub color, or user color. The user color can be selected by clicking on the user color icon and then selecting the color with the color picker.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">How to add</strong>: This drop-down menu controls how Clip Studio Paint inserts text, such as always creating a new layer, adding to selected text, or detecting a position.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Now, we know what <strong class="screenText">Edit settings</strong> are. Did you know you can transform the text you have just typed <a id="_idIndexMarker561"/>in? Read on to find out.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-149">Circular text</h2>
<p class="normal">If you want to<a id="_idIndexMarker562"/> create a fun design with circular<a id="_idIndexMarker563"/> text that goes around a round shape, this is a function for it! By clicking the <strong class="screenText">Circular text </strong>box, the settings will become available, as shown in the Figure 7.9.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_07_7.9.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.9: Sample text and the Circular text options in the Text tool’s Sub Tool Detail palette</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Radius</strong>: You can adjust the radius of the circle where the text will be placed.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Direction</strong>: When set to <strong class="screenText">Clockwise </strong>from the drop-down menu, the characters will be arranged in a clockwise direction. When set to <strong class="screenText">Counter-clockwise</strong>, the characters are arranged so that the text reads counter-clockwise.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Space evenly</strong>:<strong class="screenText"> </strong>When this is turned on, characters or words will be spaced evenly between the start and end points. You can adjust the start and end<a id="_idIndexMarker564"/> points <a id="_idIndexMarker565"/>with handles on the canvas, as shown in the preceding screenshot.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-150">Transformation settings</h2>
<p class="normal">If you want to <a id="_idIndexMarker566"/>resize, rotate, and<a id="_idIndexMarker567"/> skew text, these settings come in handy. Figure 7.10 shows the transformation square with a handle, and the <strong class="screenText">Transformation settings</strong> category of the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool Detail</strong> palette.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_07_7.10.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.10: Transformation settings options in the Text tool’s Sub Tool Detail palette</p>
<p class="normal">The following list <a id="_idIndexMarker568"/>explains <a id="_idIndexMarker569"/>the <strong class="screenText">Transformation settings</strong> options:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Show resize handle</strong>: At the top part of the resize box, you can see the handle with a small ball at the end of a bar. By turning it on, you can resize text with the handle.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Mode</strong>: This drop-down menu controls how you want to transform text, such as <strong class="screenText">Scale/Rotate</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Scale</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Rotate</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Skew</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Scale/Rotate/Skew</strong>.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Keep aspect ratio</strong>: When this is turned on, it maintains the aspect ratio while transforming the text.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Rotation angle</strong>: Adjusts the rotation angle around the horizontal axis.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Skew (horizontal)</strong>: Adjusts the horizontal skew of the text.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Skew (vertical)</strong>: Adjusts the vertical skew of the text.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Flip</strong>: The left-hand side button flips the text horizontally, and the right-hand side button flips the text vertically.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Now, you can gain control of the transformation of text. Next, there is one last setting you might <a id="_idIndexMarker570"/>want to<a id="_idIndexMarker571"/> know about.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-151">Compatibility</h2>
<p class="normal">In some cases, fonts <a id="_idIndexMarker572"/>have slight differences in appearance, depending on the version of Clip Studio Paint you are using. For example, when you’re adding new text to a manga you created in version 1.13, the same fonts might have new designs in version 3.0.</p>
<p class="normal">If you want to keep all text in your manga consistent, the safest option is to use the same font in the same version. You can select the version you are using from the drop-down menu. The only other option would be to edit the settings manually, although this would be a losing battle.</p>
<p class="normal">Now that we’re familiar with all the different options available to edit and fine-tune our text, let’s create a custom text tool preset to save these settings for a specific comic project.</p>
<div><p class="normal"><strong class="keyWord">Tip</strong></p>
<p class="normal">Do you find yourself opening the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> <strong class="screenText">Detail</strong> window often to get to a setting? The <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool Detail</strong> settings for any tool can be added to the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette in the interface by clicking on the rectangle to the left of the setting name. Settings with an eye icon next to them will appear in the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette, making them easily accessible!</p>
</div>
<p class="normal">Wow, that was quite a lot to take in – the many, many text settings, such as alignment, line space, and text color! But they allow you the freedom to control how your text appears in your comic; you can also change them depending on the scenes, tones, and <a id="_idIndexMarker573"/>mood of your comics. How about having a fixed setting that is made by you, which you can use throughout your comic without resetting it each time? Let’s make that possible by reading the next section.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-152">Creating custom text tools</h1>
<p class="normal">For some projects, you <a id="_idIndexMarker574"/>may need to use the same set of text<a id="_idIndexMarker575"/> settings many times. Making a comic is just one example of when you may want to customize a text tool that saves your font, font size, justification, and other settings so that you don’t have to set them over and over again!</p>
<p class="normal">Creating a custom text tool is easy. Follow these steps to make a saved text tool:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Select the <strong class="screenText">Text</strong> sub tool.</li>
<li class="numberedList">At the bottom right of the <strong class="screenText">Sub Tool</strong> palette, click on the <strong class="screenText">Create copy of currently selected sub tool</strong> icon.</li>
<li class="numberedList">The <strong class="screenText">Duplicate sub tool</strong> window will appear, as shown in Figure 7.11.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated" src="img/B22275_07_7.11.png"/></figure>
<figure class="mediaobject">Figure 7.11: Duplicate sub tool</figure>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Enter a name for your new text tool in the <strong class="screenText">Name</strong> text entry box.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Select a tool icon, if desired.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on the <strong class="screenText">Background color of icon</strong> checkbox and select a color to display around the icon when this sub tool is selected.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on <strong class="screenText">OK</strong> to create the new sub tool.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Using the text settings and advanced settings, make changes to the new text tool to set the font, font size, and any other options to make the text look as desired.</li>
</ol>
<p class="normal">Now, whenever<a id="_idIndexMarker576"/> you need to create text with these settings, you<a id="_idIndexMarker577"/> can select your custom text tool preset and immediately start typing!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-153">Making and editing speech balloons</h1>
<p class="normal">Since Clip Studio Paint is<a id="_idIndexMarker578"/> made primarily for <a id="_idIndexMarker579"/>creating comics, there are tools included to create speech balloons easily in the program. With just a few clicks, we can make speech balloons and tails that can be edited like vector objects.</p>
<p class="normal">Follow these steps to create a speech balloon and a tail:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Add some text to your canvas using the directions that we gave in the first section of this chapter.</li>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.14: Balloon with a tail</p>
<p class="normal">The Object tool can be used to edit the look of the balloon tail as well as the balloon. The preceding instructions show us how to make a simple balloon and tail. Let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker584"/>take a <a id="_idIndexMarker585"/>few minutes now to look at the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> options for the <strong class="screenText">Ellipse balloon</strong> tool before we discuss the other balloon tools.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-154">The Ellipse balloon tool</h2>
<p class="normal">Figure 7.15<a id="_idIndexMarker586"/> shows the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> palette for the <strong class="screenText">Ellipse balloon</strong> tool, which is the most generic and easy balloon to create. In Clip Studio Paint, you can decide how speech balloons appear, such as their color, shape, and which layer to add them to. Let’s look at how to adjust the balloon’s appearance to your desired one.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_07_7.15.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.15: Ellipse balloon tool’s Tool property palette</p>
<p class="normal">The following list<a id="_idIndexMarker587"/> describes each of the options<a id="_idIndexMarker588"/> shown in the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> window:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Line color</strong>: The color of the outline around the edge of the balloon. Usually, we set it to use the main color, which is black.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Fill color</strong>: Sets the color of the inside of the speech balloon. Usually, we set it to use the sub color, which is white.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">How to add</strong>: Controls how the balloon will be added to the image. The options are <strong class="screenText">Create new layer</strong> and <strong class="screenText">Add to selected layer</strong>. I normally select <strong class="screenText">Add to selected layer</strong> to keep the amount of layers down.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Toning</strong>: Creates the balloon by using a dot tone effect.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Figure</strong>: Sets the shape of the balloon. A rectangle, ellipse, or polygon can be created. The most common use is ellipse.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Brush size</strong>: Controls the thickness of the outline. Thinner looks smart, while thicker makes it easier for the reader to identify areas to read texts. So again, you have to think about the composition as a whole.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Anti-aliasing</strong>: Sets the anti-aliasing level for the outline of the created balloon. Select <strong class="screenText">Weak</strong> for normal usage.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Brush shape</strong>: This dropdown allows a variety of effects to be applied to the outline of the balloon. In addition to the most common setting of <strong class="screenText">Pen</strong>, more settings are available, such as <strong class="screenText">Pencil</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Airbrush</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Spray</strong>, and watercolor designs such as <strong class="screenText">Waved</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Rough Edged</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Bumpy</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Dashed Line</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Dotted</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Heart</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Star</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Laced Ribbon</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Melody</strong> can be applied to the outline.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Isn’t it easy and simple enough to create your own preferred balloon? We will look at how to<a id="_idIndexMarker589"/> edit balloon tails, which is even <a id="_idIndexMarker590"/>simpler to do, in the following section!</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-155">The Balloon tail tool</h2>
<p class="normal">In a comic, especially<a id="_idIndexMarker591"/> when there are multiple<a id="_idIndexMarker592"/> characters in the same panel, we need to indicate which dialog comes from which character to avoid confusion. So it is necessary to have an accurate balloon tail for each dialog. Let’s look into what the balloon tail options are.</p>
<p class="normal">Figure 7.16 shows the options for the <strong class="screenText">Balloon tail</strong> tool.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_07_7.16.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.16: Balloon tail tool’s Tool property palette</p>
<p class="normal">The following list describes each of the options for the <strong class="screenText">Balloon tail</strong> tool:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">How to bend</strong>: Sets <a id="_idIndexMarker593"/>the type of tail to be<a id="_idIndexMarker594"/> created. These are <strong class="screenText">Straight line</strong>, <strong class="screenText">Polyline</strong>, and <strong class="screenText">Spline</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_07_7.17.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.17: Various Balloon tail tools</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Width of tail</strong>: Controls the width of the tail at the starting point. The width was set to 142.0 in the preceding screenshot.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Great, now you know how to set the balloon tail options! Let’s move on to different-shaped<a id="_idIndexMarker595"/> balloons, which come in handy when you need more than ellipse-shaped <a id="_idIndexMarker596"/>balloons.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-156">The Curve balloon tool</h2>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Curve balloon</strong><strong class="screenText"><a id="_idIndexMarker597"/></strong> tool is another way to create speech <a id="_idIndexMarker598"/>balloons, allowing for greater flexibility in shaping balloons. Figure 7.18 shows the options for this tool.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_07_7.18.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.18: Curve balloon tool’s Tool property palette</p>
<p class="normal">Many of these options are the same as the <strong class="screenText">Ellipse balloon</strong> tool. The following list explains the options that are unique to this tool:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Curve</strong>: Controls how to make the curves of the balloon. For a detailed description of each of the <strong class="screenText">Curve</strong> options, see the <em class="italic">Curve ruler</em> section in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 13</em>, <em class="italic">All About Rulers</em>.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Sharp angles</strong>: Changes corners from smooth curves to hard corners.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">So a balloon <a id="_idIndexMarker599"/>doesn’t have to be round all the time! Let’s look<a id="_idIndexMarker600"/> at even more different shapes of balloons in the next section.</p>
<h2 class="heading-2" id="_idParaDest-157">The Balloon pen tool</h2>
<p class="normal">Most of the time, the <a id="_idIndexMarker601"/>Clip Studio Paint tools to make<a id="_idIndexMarker602"/> ellipses, tails, and curves are sufficient to tell your story. If you use them right, they are customizable and easily legible.</p>
<p class="normal">However, sometimes you may want to create your own balloons. If you have a very ornate style of comic, then you will most likely want to create your own balloons and even start learning calligraphy. Alternatively, maybe you just want to draw your own balloon because you want to convey a tone, such as an angry or panicked character.</p>
<p class="normal">The <strong class="screenText">Balloon pen</strong> tool allows us to create speech balloons by drawing them freehand. Figure 7.19 shows the <strong class="screenText">Tool property</strong> options for this tool.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_07_7.19.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.19: Balloon pen tool’s Tool property palette</p>
<p class="normal">By now, we <a id="_idIndexMarker603"/>have seen most of these settings <a id="_idIndexMarker604"/>already. In fact, there is only one new option to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="screenText">Post correction</strong>: When this option is checked, the program will smooth out lines after they are drawn. The amount of correction is based on the value selected in the bar to the right of the option name. I normally put this setting at a minimum value, as the reason I use the <strong class="screenText">Balloon pen</strong> tool is to create hand-drawn lines, such as a shaky-lined balloon for a scared character’s dialog.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">That just leaves us with one more question: <em class="italic">what shape should I draw</em>? This is really a wonderful question, as it’s something you’ll always be learning. I’d suggest that you look through some of your favorite comics for inspiration, as well as the speech balloon materials available in Clip Studio Paint. If you need to, you can put these materials (or even images found online) onto a canvas and trace them for practice.</p>
<p class="normal">You now have mastery over speech balloons; using the options we have learned about, you can add balloons, change their shape and color, edit their tails, and even draw freehand-shaped balloons!</p>
<p class="normal">How about <a id="_idIndexMarker605"/>having more than one dialog in one panel? You <a id="_idIndexMarker606"/>can also connect them if they come from the same character! Isn’t that fun?</p>
<p class="normal">We will discuss how to do this in the next section!</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-158">Implementing connected speech balloons</h1>
<p class="normal">In this section, we <a id="_idIndexMarker607"/>are going to learn how to<a id="_idIndexMarker608"/> implement connected speech balloons. Connected speech balloons are used when you have dialog in multiple speech balloons that are connected together with balloon tails, as shown in Figure 7.20.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_07_7.20.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.20: Screenshot of connected balloons</p>
<p class="normal">This style of speech balloon is easy to do in Clip Studio Paint, but it does require a bit of forethought. Setting up connected speech balloons actually occurs during the text tool phase of making speech balloons. Follow these steps to create connected speech balloons:</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="1">Type in the text for the first speech balloon by using the <strong class="screenText">Text</strong> tool. Click on the<a id="_idIndexMarker609"/> checked-circle<a id="_idIndexMarker610"/> icon below the text entry to commit the text. This icon is shown in Figure 7.21.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_07_7.21.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.21: Text typing command bar</p>
<ol>
<li class="numberedList" value="2">With the <strong class="screenText">Text</strong> tool selected, move the cursor close to the box surrounding the first text you entered. A <strong class="screenText">+</strong> icon will appear next to the cursor when <a id="_idIndexMarker611"/>you are in the correct spot to make a connecting text box. Click and enter the text for the second balloon.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Click on the checked-circle icon once the second area of text is entered. A box will appear around any text areas that are connected, as shown in Figure 7.22.</li>
</ol>

<li class="numberedList" value="4">Create a <a id="_idIndexMarker612"/>balloon around each<a id="_idIndexMarker613"/> section of text, using the instructions in the <em class="italic">Making and editing speech balloons</em> section of this chapter.</li>
<li class="numberedList">Select the <strong class="screenText">Balloon tail</strong> tool and drag a tail from the first balloon to the second, as shown in Figure 7.23.</li>

<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.24: Connected speech balloons</p>
<p class="normal">Wow, the two dialogs are connected! Comic readers would perfectly understand that both balloons come from the same character!</p>
<p class="normal">Now, you know<a id="_idIndexMarker616"/> how to handle multiple balloons in one panel, so you won’t panic when there are multiple dialogs. You <a id="_idIndexMarker617"/>can just type the next dialog by clicking the <strong class="screenText">+</strong> icon under the first dialog, create balloons, and then connect them with tails.</p>
<p class="normal">In the next section, we are going to learn how to use ready-made special balloons. You might find one that is really suitable for your comic or manga creation.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-159">Using speech balloon materials</h1>
<p class="normal">In addition to having the <a id="_idIndexMarker618"/>speech balloon sub tools at your<a id="_idIndexMarker619"/> disposal, Clip Studio Paint also has a library of speech balloon materials for special dialog, emotional moments, and almost anything else you can imagine.</p>
<p class="normal">We will cover materials in more depth in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 10</em>, <em class="italic">Vector Layers and the Material Palette</em>, but let’s take a look at the specific speech balloons in the <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> palette<a id="_idIndexMarker620"/> now. </p>
<p class="normal">This section of the <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> palette is shown in Figure 7.25.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_07_7.25.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.25: Speech balloon materials</p>
<p class="normal">Balloon materials <a id="_idIndexMarker621"/>are located in the <strong class="screenText">Manga material</strong> category of the library. There are three subcategories of balloons, as detailed in the following list:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Dialog</strong>: <strong class="screenText">Dialog</strong> balloons include balloons for shouting, mumbling, announcements, whispering, thought clouds, and more.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Feeling</strong>: <strong class="screenText">Feeling</strong> balloons are more specialized, with color borders of flowers, stars, and more.</li>
<li class="bulletList"><strong class="keyWord">Narration</strong>: The <strong class="screenText">Narration</strong> category contains various rectangle balloons, perfect for narration in comics.</li>
</ul>
<p class="normal">Note that some of these materials may need to be downloaded from the Clip Studio Assets before use. For more information, please refer to <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 18</em>, <em class="italic">Exploring the Clip Studio Assets and Animation</em>.</p>
<p class="normal">To use a speech<a id="_idIndexMarker622"/> balloon material, select the material to highlight it, and then click on the <strong class="screenText">Paste selected material to canvas</strong> icon at the bottom of the <strong class="screenText">Material</strong> palette.</p>
<p class="normal">The icon is shown in Figure 7.26.</p>
<figure class="mediaobject"><img alt="" src="img/B22275_07_7.26.png"/></figure>
<p class="packt_figref">Figure 7.26: Paste selected material to canvas icon</p>
<p class="normal">Speech balloon materials will not automatically attach themselves to text that is present in an<a id="_idIndexMarker623"/> image, so the material may need to be<a id="_idIndexMarker624"/> repositioned and resized to fit the text.</p>
<h1 class="heading-1" id="_idParaDest-160">Summary</h1>
<p class="normal">In this chapter, we learned about how to use the <strong class="screenText">Text</strong> tool and the settings to edit and fine-tune text. We learned how to create a custom text tool to save text settings for our comic projects. Then, we learned how to create speech balloons with tails, how to connect speech balloons, and about the speech balloon materials.</p>
<p class="normal">These skills are great to have, not only for lettering and drawing speech balloons faster and more accurately but also so you can give dialog your own unique look. Text in comics and manga is indeed part of your creation and is as important as your art in telling a story.</p>
<p class="normal">As you read more manga and comics, you’ll notice how the fonts and their placement perfectly complement the scenes, pacing, and story themes. It’s good to know what is appropriate for your manga – if you are after overall artistic consistency, you should consider creating your own fonts. It’s a skillset of its own, but you will start seeing meaningful differences without being an expert in calligraphy and letter design! Having said that, we need to remember that the most important thing is readability; choose legible design over an artistic look to be able to tell your story, always.</p>
<p class="normal">In the next chapter, we will learn about some techniques to ink artwork while also looking at the many available inking tools.</p>
