- en: Type-driven development is an approach to programming that uses a static-type
    system to achieve desirable attributes, such as safety and efficiency. This book
    will cover type-driven development using the ReasonML language and explains how
    to put its type system to use in order to check that your code is logically consistent.
    We use types to express relationships and other assumptions directly in the code,
    and these assumptions are enforced by the ReasonML compiler before the code is
    run.

- en: 'If you''ve ever wrestled with this problem: *Undefined is not a function*,
    then this book might be for you. If you''re looking for a way to write less defensive
    code, fewer trivial tests, and not worry about breaking code if you try to refactor,
    then you may be interested in the concepts of type-driven development.'

- en: This book is for you if you are a programmer (it doesn't matter what kind) who's
    interested in writing safe, efficient code. There are many techniques and processes
    for achieving that, of course, but type-driven development is one of the most
    mainstream and accessible.

- en: That being said, this book presents type-driven development using a relatively
    unfamiliar language. I've tried to write as plainly as possible; but to follow
    along, you'll still need to learn the rules and logic of a powerful type system.
    You will reach a point where your mind works in tandem with the compiler, but
    that will take time and patience. The reward will be that the compiler becomes
    your friend in writing safer and more correct code.

    introduces a number of foundational concepts, such as types and values. It also
