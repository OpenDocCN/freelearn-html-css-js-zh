<h1 id="_idParaDest-220"><a id="_idTextAnchor220"/>Landing Your First Job</h1>
<p>Okay, so, you’ve spent a lot of time and expended a lot of calories learning the technical side of web development. You’ve built some code and you now think you’re ready for the next step: landing your first job and starting your web development career. But how do you actually <em class="italic">do</em> that?!</p>
<p>I’m old enough to remember a time when getting a job meant looking at wanted ads in physical newspapers (ugh, I hate writing that!), but nowadays, that’s rarely how people find jobs. And even then, once you find a job opening, the process of applying, interviewing, and ultimately getting a job isn’t usually just a one-time chat with a manager, particularly in web development. You may have to impress more than one person to become an employed web developer.</p>
<p>I’m also old enough and experienced enough in this field that I’ve been through several interviews myself, and perhaps more importantly, I’ve <em class="italic">conducted</em> hundreds of interviews. That means I know what it’s like to be on both sides of the table – I know how terrifying being the candidate can be, and I know how immensely difficult it is to conduct a good interview (seriously, it seems like it’s just asking questions, but doing it well and fairly is <em class="italic">so</em> much harder than it seems). I’m going to take all that knowledge and experience and roll it into this chapter, hopefully to your benefit!</p>
<p>With that in mind, this chapter will give you the knowledge you need to find job openings in web development, how to apply for them, what the interviews might be like, how you can effectively prep for them and handle them, and a few other topics that I feel are important to keep in the back of your mind, such as work/life balance.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding the FAANG/non-FAANG divide</li>
<li>Using the web to become a web developer!</li>
<li>Polishing your resume to a glistening sheen</li>
<li>Having repos, portfolios, and samples to show</li>
<li>Understanding a typical web developer interview</li>
<li>Handling common interview questions</li>
<li>Remembering that it’s not all about work</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-221"><a id="_idTextAnchor221"/>Understanding the FAANG/non-FAANG divide</h1>
<p>I touched on FAANG briefly in <a href="B18315_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, but let’s dig deeper and get into some related ideas.</p>
<p>If you go online right now and look at several of the most popular subreddits on Reddit, or on many other sites where people gather to discuss how to get a job in the IT field, you’ll very quickly come across a common term stating that there’s only one target and one way into this field, and that term is FAANG. What does it mean and why do people focus on it so much?</p>
<p><strong class="bold">FAANG</strong> stands for <strong class="bold">Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google</strong>. It began in stock market circles to refer to the<a id="_idIndexMarker875"/> largest, most<a id="_idIndexMarker876"/> well-known tech stocks. Nowadays, there are several other acronyms you might <a id="_idIndexMarker877"/>see, such as <strong class="bold">FAAMG</strong> (<strong class="bold">Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Google</strong>), <strong class="bold">MAMAA</strong> (<strong class="bold">Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet</strong>), and <strong class="bold">MATANA</strong> (<strong class="bold">Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, Alphabet, Nvidia, </strong><strong class="bold">and Amazon</strong>).</p>
<p>We’ll let the stock boys sort<a id="_idIndexMarker878"/> out which acronym they think makes the most sense for their realm, but for developers, FAANG is most often used to refer to the biggest, most well-paying, and best-for-your-career companies to work at. It’s less about specific companies and more so about companies that are viewed favorably from a tech employment standpoint. Some companies can still be considered a “FAANG company,” even if they’re not one of the five listed. Companies such as Airbnb, Samsung, Oracle, Adobe, Cisco, Qualcomm, eBay, and Uber might be considered FAANG companies by some people, for example.</p>
<p>Online, you’ll see a lot of conversations about joining FAANG companies – regardless of exactly which companies are represented in the acronym – talking about the companies that will look best on your resumes going forward. Or talking about the companies where the best and brightest tend to work. Or talking about the companies where you’ll bust your butt working but will be rewarded financially and in cache because other developers will almost look upon you with awe. Or all of the above!</p>
<p>To be clear: yes, these types of companies tend to pay very well. And yes, these companies do tend to look good on a resume. And yes, working there will be challenging but rewarding because you will be working with a lot of top-notch engineers and the latest tech, and you’ll be<a id="_idIndexMarker879"/> working on some exciting products that will probably affect a lot of people’s lives. But they aren’t the best choice for everyone, and most likely aren’t the best choice for someone just starting. Still, how do you make that decision for yourself? Let’s talk about that a bit.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-222"><a id="_idTextAnchor222"/>Calibrating your FAANG expectations</h2>
<p>What I’ve said so far is all good stuff and it’s easy to understand why so many developers are excited by the opportunity to work at such companies. But I see a lot of people in online discussions making a big mistake when it comes to FAANG: they think it’s the only way to fame<a id="_idIndexMarker880"/> and riches and they think there is nowhere else to work where you can do exciting work. Some also make the mistake of thinking that simply graduating college with a CS degree is enough to get you in the door in such companies.</p>
<p>None of that is true. There are great opportunities elsewhere, and most of them will be a lot easier to land than at FAANG companies.</p>
<p>To be blunt: as an entry-level developer, your odds of being hired at any FAANG or FAANG-like company are pretty low. These companies are looking for the cream of the crop and, more importantly, people who can <em class="italic">prove</em> they are just that. You could be the best developer out there right now but if you don’t have a track record, it may not be outright impossible to be hired at a FAANG, but it’s certainly not something you should bank on. Even people with a lot of experience and a proven track record of success often find it difficult to get hired at such companies because the interview process is so rigorous (a topic I’ll get into more later in this chapter).</p>
<p>Don’t let that blunt your enthusiasm, though! As I said, there are great opportunities outside of FAANG companies – positions that tend to be somewhat easier to get. While working at a FAANG will bolster your resume, working at a non-FAANG company will tend to offer you a gentler introduction to the professional IT world. Many companies are using the latest technology too, so you’ll have almost as much opportunity to learn on the job but with a bit less stress and high expectations as you will be when placed at a FAANG.</p>
<p>It’s not strictly FAANG <a id="_idIndexMarker881"/>versus non-FAANG, though. There’s another divide to be aware of besides FAANG versus non-FAANG, and that’s tech companies versus non-tech companies.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-223"><a id="_idTextAnchor223"/>Comparing tech companies to non-tech companies</h2>
<p>Tech companies are those that produce products – specifically tech products – and sell them to customers. Apple is a great example of this. They create iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks, among many other gadgets, all of <a id="_idIndexMarker882"/>which are tech products. Their entire focus is on making those products and developing the tech in them. Tech is therefore central to what they do because it essentially <em class="italic">is</em> the product.</p>
<p>By contrast, take a company such as Wells Fargo. They’re a financial company, so things such as checking accounts, credit cards, and mutual funds are their products. But there is a lot of tech that goes into making their products possible, it’s just that the tech isn’t the product they sell directly. Tech is something that enables their core product offerings. At such a company, you, as a developer, might create a system that’s used to reconcile daily account activity, but that system isn’t what gets sold to customers – likely, they wouldn’t even know about it. Wells Fargo is a non-tech company because while tech is a key ingredient in what they do, that tech isn’t the end product.</p>
<p>FAANG companies tend to be tech companies (some would blur the line certainly, but as a broad generality, this is true). And tech companies – I think it’s obvious to say – tend to have a higher bar for their tech people simply because it’s necessitated by the products they produce.</p>
<p>The conclusion from all of this is that when looking for your first job, my advice would be to look for non-tech, non-FAANG positions first. I don’t want to give a false impression that they’ll be easy to get – landing your first job in IT is going to be a challenge no matter what experience you have – but it will be comparatively a lot easier than a tech company, especially a FAANG. They will allow you to build up that experience, and your track record, at which point you can target tech companies and even FAANGs more effectively and up your odds of success in landing such a position.</p>
<p>Of course, that isn’t to say you should ignore such tech companies entirely. Definitely not! If a good opportunity presents itself then by all means, go for it! But you need to set realistic expectations and tailor your job search based on those expectations, and non-tech companies are often a better bet.</p>
<p>At this point, you understand<a id="_idIndexMarker883"/> what a FAANG is, and you understand tech companies versus non-tech companies. Now, let’s talk about how you can go about finding job opportunities out in the world regardless of the kind of company you want to apply to.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-224"><a id="_idTextAnchor224"/>Using the web to become a web developer!</h1>
<p>Being a web developer means being able to use the web, and that might as well start with finding a web developer job! Today, it’s probably more common to find a job online rather than any other way. Fortunately, because it’s so common, it has become pretty easy. To begin with, there are many sites dedicated to job hunting.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-225"><a id="_idTextAnchor225"/>Using job hunting sites</h2>
<p>There is no shortage of sites that list job <a id="_idIndexMarker884"/>openings on the web, and many will make the process of applying a snap. Of course, as a general rule, you’ll probably want to stick with the most well-known sites out there. As of this writing, in no particular order, those would include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic">Indeed</em> (<a href="http://indeed.com">indeed.com</a>): Generally, this is the largest site out there with the best coverage of most industries.</li>
<li><em class="italic">CareerBuilder</em> (<a href="http://careerbuilder.com">careerbuilder.com</a>): This site, like many of these, offers more than just job listings, including things such as a career advice blog and salary information.</li>
<li><em class="italic">ZipRecruiter</em> (<a href="http://ziprecruiter.com">ziprecruiter.com</a>): ZipRecruiter is good for job hunters as well as employers and has a lot of great features, including a resume database so that employers can search for the right candidate themselves.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Monster</em> (<a href="http://monster.com">monster.com</a>): Monster is one of the elder statesmen of job-hunting sites at this point, but it’s still a great site with an easy-to-use job search engine.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Glassdoor</em> (<a href="http://glassdoor.com">glassdoor.com</a>): Glassdoor is somewhat unique in that not only does it have job listings, but it also has anonymous feedback from current employees, giving you a good insight into what working at a given company might be like.</li>
<li><em class="italic">LinkedIn</em> (<a href="http://linkedin.com">linkedin.com</a>): I’m going to talk about LinkedIn specifically shortly, but suffice it to say that it can be a big help in hunting down a job, but in a slightly different way than most others.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Dice</em> (<a href="http://dice.com">dice.com</a>): Dice is a US-only <a id="_idIndexMarker885"/>tech-specific site, so while it’s not generally applicable like the others are, it’s perfect for you as a prospective web developer, assuming you’re in the US that is.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Upwork</em> (<a href="http://upwork.com">upwork.com</a>): This site is a bit different: if you want to do freelance work, this site will help you get matched up with people looking to hire a developer for a single project. This can be a good way to gain some experience while making some money and searching for something more permanent.</li>
</ul>
<p>As someone trying to get into the field for the first time, finding a job that fits you can be hard. But one piece of advice I’d give is don’t limit yourself too much. At first, you’ll have a natural tendency to filter by entry-level positions, or job listings that specify a lower skill level since it makes sense to think you’d have a better shot at such a position. But, while you definitely shouldn’t go off applying for every position listed, especially those that list a lot of skills you have no idea about, don’t be afraid to apply for a position that seems just a little beyond your grasp. Often, you can impress during an interview (which we’ll talk about later!), which can cause people to give you a shot, knowing they may have to train you a bit. It’s a fine line between jobs that are really beyond your reach at this point and those you can grow into if given a chance. Ultimately, the point is don’t sell yourself <em class="italic">too</em> short.</p>
<p>Getting back to the sites themselves, these sites offer a lot of other things too, not just job listings. They can help you write a good resume, give you job-hunting advice, provide insight into the companies you may apply to, and they can even proactively match you up with openings based on criteria you (and a prospective employer) set. All of this is helpful functionality that can help in your search.</p>
<p>But these sites aren’t the be-all, end-all of job hunting. There is another way to go that, yes, requires more time and effort on<a id="_idIndexMarker886"/> your part, but which can sometimes lead to paths you might miss otherwise, and that’s going directly to the websites of various companies.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-226"><a id="_idTextAnchor226"/>Going directly to company sites</h2>
<p>Most companies in the world have a website, and many of them have job postings listed there. The important thing to <a id="_idIndexMarker887"/>remember is that there may be job postings on company websites that aren’t on the major job hunt websites, or that may not appear on those sites until later. Therefore, you could potentially get moving on an opportunity before hundreds or thousands of others are even aware of it, which gives you a leg-up on the competition!</p>
<p>So, the first thing to do is to find companies you may want to work for. This will usually mean some online searches, and usually, that will be for companies in your area or a reasonable commuting distance. Of course, if you’re open to relocation, then your opportunities grow (my first job in IT was in a different US state, which required relocation). You’ll want to do some research, see what the company is all about, and maybe try to get some “insider” information from a site such as Glassdoor to work out if it’s somewhere you might want to work.</p>
<p>As part of that research, explore their website. You’ll most likely be able to find a link to job postings somewhere, perhaps in their <strong class="bold">human resources</strong> (<strong class="bold">HR</strong>) section. Failing that, you will probably be able to at<a id="_idIndexMarker888"/> least find a phone number or email address that will allow you to contact the company and inquire about openings. But let’s assume you find job postings online.</p>
<p>At that point, you’ll want to scrutinize the jobs listed and decide which are right for you. And again, while you shouldn’t apply to everything, don’t be too shy either. It’s often true that job listings are written by HR folks who don’t have a full or proper grasp of what a position requires. For example, the job listing may list a whole bunch of technical skills (languages and technologies), but in reality, only a subset is required. It may also be true that even a subset isn’t required, per se – if you can demonstrate your ability to learn, then you may get hired even minus all the listed skills.</p>
<p>The trick – and it’s a difficult one to pull off, to be honest about it – is to get past HR and get to the technical people who will ultimately decide whether to extend you an offer or not. This is true regardless of whether your initial contact starts directly from a company’s website or through a job search website. If you can manage it, though, you have an opportunity to impress someone, and that’s ultimately the goal.</p>
<p>So far, we have covered two main strategies for finding a job. However, there is a third that you may have more difficulty <a id="_idIndexMarker889"/>availing yourself of when trying to get your first job in the field, though you shouldn’t dismiss it entirely, and that’s networking.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-227"><a id="_idTextAnchor227"/>Building a network</h2>
<p>Getting into the field can be <a id="_idIndexMarker890"/>challenging, but once you’re in and have built up some experience, it gets a little easier to get your next job or advance to the next position. To be clear, it never outright gets <em class="italic">easy</em>, but certainly <em class="italic">easier</em>. One of the things that makes it easier even beyond experience is the people you meet along the way. There’s a famous saying that it’s not what you know but <em class="italic">who</em> you know, and while it may not be as absolute as the saying suggests, there is truth to it.</p>
<p>As you work in the industry, you’ll meet many people – coworkers, managers, and people you interact with on other teams. If you cultivate relationships with them, they become assets down the road when and if you are on the hunt for another job (hopefully voluntarily, but you never know). As these people move around to other companies, and you keep in touch with them, they become your “ins” – people you can go to to find out about openings before they become public perhaps, or simply to get your resume into the HR system faster.</p>
<p>This is your <strong class="bold">network</strong>, and building that network is called <strong class="bold">networking</strong>. The good news is no special skills are required: you just <a id="_idIndexMarker891"/>have to talk to people! I suppose that might be a special skill for some, but it’s one anyone can learn if so.</p>
<p>Note that this doesn’t mean you need to go to ballgames and their kids’ recitals all the time! I mean, making friends is great too, but this is a <em class="italic">professional</em> network, so what we mean is keeping contact information for people, ensuring it’s valid, and maybe an occasional “Hi, how are you?” touch base email to maintain the relationship.</p>
<p>Some websites can help you do this too, but one stands above the rest – LinkedIn. I mentioned it before, but it bears some further discussion because it’s more about building your network than it is job hunting – though it turns out to be great for the latter because of the former!</p>
<p>Once you join LinkedIn, you’ll build your profile there, which includes things such as schooling, work experience, and technical skills, but what’s helpful is that you can get others to endorse your skills, thereby showing the world what you know and that it’s not just you claiming that you’re good at these things. Then, you network with people you know, or companies you’re familiar with. LinkedIn will suggest people to you based on your profile data as well as your geographic location. You then <em class="italic">connect</em> with these people – assuming they reciprocate – and that starts to build a web of people you’re connected to.</p>
<p>One of the most helpful things <a id="_idIndexMarker892"/>you can do is connect with recruiters. Once you start building out your LinkedIn profile, you’ll almost certainly start getting connection invitations from recruiters before too long. These are people whose job it is to get people hired. It’s not out of the kindness of their hearts: recruiters get paid to do this, usually by employers, but sometimes by employees. They’ll take your profile (and resume) and work to find job listings that you match up with. They will sometimes have access to listings that aren’t public yet, which can make them a valuable asset. Recruiters – at least the good ones – will often help prep you a bit for your interview, giving you tips and pointers specific to the job you’re interviewing for. Afterward, they can get feedback from the company if you aren’t hired, and they can then use it to help you perform better next time.</p>
<p>Of course, as with most things, not all recruiters are equal, and not all are especially good. So, you must use your gut when dealing with them. Don’t sign anything unless you’re <em class="italic">really</em> comfortable with them! You don’t want to find yourself tied to one and only one recruiter because you signed an exclusivity contract, for example (thankfully, such tactics aren’t common). A good recruiter will be like a good car salesman: solid and helpful, but not overly forceful. It’s one of those “you’ll know a bad one when you see it” situations.</p>
<p>There’s another way you can start building your network even as a newcomer to the field, and it also happens to be free (in most cases), as well as fun and educational! I’m talking about the world of user groups and meetups.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-228"><a id="_idTextAnchor228"/>User groups and meetups</h2>
<p>Building a network is great in <a id="_idIndexMarker893"/>theory, but it can be a challenge if you aren’t already in the industry. One way you can overcome this difficulty is to attend user groups and meetups (user groups tend to be viewed as an older term, with meetups being the more common modern version of it, but they mean the same thing).</p>
<p>All around the world, you can find tech professionals, or just enthusiasts, who have meetings to discuss various topics in tech. You can often find such meetings where a professional developer – sometimes even someone well-known – will come in and give a presentation on a given topic. Maybe it’s how to use VMs more effectively, or maybe it’s an introduction to React. This can be a great way to learn things of course, but even better is the chance to meet people.</p>
<p>These meetings will often be <a id="_idIndexMarker894"/>accompanied by some pizza and snacks and will almost always have a period before and after when people can just mingle a bit. If you’re an outgoing person, you can simply walk up to people and introduce yourself beforehand. It’s a little easier after the presentation though since you can start a conversation about what you just heard.</p>
<p>It’s also an environment where eavesdropping can be very beneficial! Even if you keep to yourself, just hearing the discussions people are having can yield valuable insights. You may hear about some new technology taking the world by storm. Or you may hear interesting ways people are doing things at companies you’ve never heard of. And you may even catch some crosstalk about how someone is having trouble finding people to fill roles at their company. That could be a nugget of golden information for someone on the hunt for a job!</p>
<p>One of the main sites you can use to learn about meetups is, ironically, called Meetup (<a href="http://meetup.com">meetup.com</a>). Here, you can search for topics <a id="_idIndexMarker895"/>of interest to you, search geographically so you aren’t traveling super far, and you can sign up for different groups to get news about upcoming events. Conversations sometimes happen here – usually after a given event – that can also yield great information. It’s a free site to join, so I highly encourage you to do so.</p>
<p>You should be aware, however, that some meetups might have a (usually very small) cost associated with them. This is understandable when you realize that someone must pay for the food, the space it’s held in, and possibly the speaker on a given night. While it’s true that there is usually a sponsor (a sponsor whose purpose for sponsoring a meetup is explicitly to look for candidates for positions they’re trying to fill, by the way!), that isn’t always the case. So, don’t be surprised if you’re asked for a few dollars for entry – it will typically be a small amount (I think $5 is the most I’ve ever been asked for in all the hundreds of meetups I’ve attended) and you can think of it as a small investment in your job hunt.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-229"><a id="_idTextAnchor229"/>Perseverance is key</h2>
<p>One thing to keep in mind as you job hunt is that in today’s market, things may not come easy, no matter what path you work to find opportunities.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is not uncommon to <a id="_idIndexMarker896"/>hear nothing back when you submit a resume or otherwise contact a potential employer. This you can kind of understand – it’s not feasible to get back to everyone who submits a resume just to say no when a company is getting hundreds of them – but it’s something you have to understand going in; otherwise, it can be disheartening.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is not uncommon to even go through the entire interview process and then not hear anything back, not even a “we’ve decided to go with someone else” courtesy call. You’d think people would at least let you know that decision was a no just so you aren’t waiting around, but that’s often not the case (it’s probably <em class="italic">more</em> common to <em class="italic">not</em> hear anything honestly).</p>
<p>It’s also not uncommon, unfortunately, to have to apply dozens or maybe even hundreds of times before finding something. Especially as someone with no prior work experience, it’s not an easy road to land that first position.</p>
<p>That’s why it’s so important to not lose hope, always remain positive, and persevere until the right opportunity finally presents itself and all the hard work pays off. At the time of writing, the market is a bit on the tough side for new folks to get into the field. It’s not impossible, but you do have to have patience and keep going at it, even when it seems like you’re getting nowhere. You’ll get there, it just might take some time (then again, you might land the perfect job right out of the gate – you never know, so perseverance is an important trait to have).</p>
<p>Okay, so, you have some job-hunting sites to go to, you’ve checked out company websites directly, and you’ve built a network up by attending some meetups. Now, it’s time to apply for a position. That nearly always starts with the same input, and that’s your resume, so let’s talk about that now.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-230"><a id="_idTextAnchor230"/>Polishing your resume to a glistening sheen</h1>
<p>A resume – or <strong class="bold">Curriculum Vitae</strong> (<strong class="bold">CV</strong>), if you’re outside<a id="_idIndexMarker897"/> of America – is your passport, so to<a id="_idIndexMarker898"/> speak, to employment. It will nearly always be the first thing anyone sees of you when you apply for a job, and while in successful acquisition of said job, it’ll just be one component, and it can kill the opportunity right at the start if it’s not presented well.</p>
<p>Building a good resume largely comes down to following a few common guidelines, and then accentuating with the things that make you uniquely you. Let’s talk about the guidelines first.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-231"><a id="_idTextAnchor231"/>Building a solid resume</h2>
<p>There’s a lot of advice online and elsewhere about what goes into writing a good resume, but I think you’ll find that the <a id="_idIndexMarker899"/>following items are pretty much universal:</p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic">Keep it concise</em>: Especially when you have a lot of experience, it’s natural to want to put it all in there, and you can wind up with five to six pages describing everything you’ve ever done. You have to fight that urge though because it’s almost always counterproductive, and you should limit your resume to one or two pages. Keep in mind that the goal of a resume is essentially to open the door. If you do that, you’ll have time to get into all the details during the interview process. Until then, though, you want to avoid anything that might make people ignore your resume, and being overly long is often cited as one such thing. Resumes that are longer than about two pages will often just be thrown in the trash without even being looked at. It may seem unfair – and it probably <em class="italic">is</em> unfair – but it’s the reality, so you have to deal with it.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Clear layout</em>: You might think that the more unique your resume the better, so you might be inclined to play with crazy design decisions. And for some job postings, that might be helpful – for example, if you are applying as a graphic designer. But the general rule of thumb is that you should mostly keep it fairly pedestrian. Use clear, professional-looking, easy-to-read fonts. Use clear, descriptive, and generally short headings to denote the major parts of your resume. Use bullet points to denote lists. And generally, don’t get too creative with the overall layout.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Use keywords</em>: In a lot of companies, your resume will start by going through an automated screening process where it will often be eliminated before a human being even looks at it. This is most often done by looking for keywords. For example, if a vacant position is for a frontend developer with React skills, a resume that doesn’t like React may be eliminated immediately. Therefore, put some effort into using keywords in your resume that match up with the <em class="italic">specific</em> job opening you’re applying to, or if you aren’t applying to a specific position (maybe you are just putting <a id="_idIndexMarker900"/>your resume in at a company you especially want to work for without knowing if they have openings or not), then try to use as many keywords as possible that are also accurate. That’s because of the next bullet point here.</li>
<li><em class="italic">No lies or exaggerations</em>: Stick to the truth! You may well get away with a lie or stretching the truth here and there, but if you’re found out, it will destroy any chance you have of landing a position. It could hurt you even if you do get hired, if in no other way than reputationally. To be clear, there is a difference between describing things you’ve done in as positive a light as possible and being dishonest about it! A resume is, in part, a sales job, so it’s okay and encouraged to use language that is as positive as possible. But follow the simple rule that if it’s not true and if you can’t substantiate it if pressed then you shouldn’t put it on your resume.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Proofread</em>: Check the grammar and spelling in your resume a million times before sending it to anyone and use all tools you can to help with this! Some people will gloss over minor typos and not hold them against you, but others may outright disqualify you for them. Either way, it’s a bad look: one of the things you want to demonstrate when trying to get hired is attention to detail, and that starts with a resume that is flawless in terms of spelling and grammar. Have others read your resume before you send it anywhere too because a second (or third or fourth…) set of eyes is always a good thing.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Avoid irrelevant information</em>: It used to be the case that people recommended putting things such as personal hobbies on a resume because it showed that you have a life outside of work and that you may not be, to put it bluntly, a stiff. Always remember that people like to work with others that are pleasant to be around and that they have things in common with others outside of work because it gives them common ground and touchpoints to be social around. But a resume isn’t the place for that, so the current thinking is to skip this sort of stuff on a resume. The time for it is during and after an interview if things are and have gone well.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Contact details</em>: You’d be surprised how often you get a resume, think it looks pretty good, and then notice that there’s no information about contacting the candidate on it! That’s a sure way to miss out on an opportunity, so ensure these details are present and are current.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Use professional language</em>: You’re applying for a job, hopefully starting a career if all goes well, which <a id="_idIndexMarker901"/>means you’re communicating in a professional context. As such, avoid slang or casual phrases in your resume. Again, there is a time and place for such things later, because your personality does come into play during the interview process, and there comes a time when being a little less formal can be a good thing. But your resume isn’t the place to do that.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Highlight achievements</em>: You want to be as specific as possible about the things you’ve done and accomplished, and if you have metrics to support them, then so much the better. If you built a system that saved your employer $10,000 a month, then you’ll want to say that. Of course, if you don’t have any work experience yet then this will become more difficult. But there’s almost always <em class="italic">something</em>: did you contribute to an open-source project to get some experience? Did you build a personal website? Did you write a game? Did you work as a stock person at a big-box retail store? Achievements don’t necessarily have to be directly related to the field you’re entering (though it’s better if they are, of course) – you just have to know how to sell it. I’ll talk about this a bit more in the next section.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Tailor it</em>: Finally, whenever possible, customize your resume for the job you’re applying for. If you know a company is looking for someone to do some cloud development in AWS, then you may want to talk up your experience with cloud providers, even if it’s not AWS. If a company you’re applying to services mutual funds, then you might want to describe the time you worked as a teller in a bank in a bit more detail because it’s in the same financial industry. Again, don’t be dishonest about anything, but a resume that takes into account where you’re applying to is better than submitting the same generic resume you submit everywhere else (sometimes, you’ll have no choice but to do just that, but any time you can tailor your resume, do so).</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing you may also consider is engaging the services of a professional resume writing service, such as TopResume (<a href="http://topresume.com">topresume.com</a>). They will – for a price – work with you to produce a top-notch resume. They know all the best practices, they know what companies look for in<a id="_idIndexMarker902"/> resumes, and they know all the tips and tricks to get your resume to the top <a id="_idIndexMarker903"/>of the pile, or at least lower the odds as much as possible of it being ignored. If you aren’t comfortable with the prospect of putting a good resume together, then such services may be worth considering, But, if you’re comfortable doing it yourself, then you can save a few dollars. Such services typically offer different packages, ranging from a basic review of a resume you created to holding your hand through the entire writing process and even sometimes helping you get your resume submitted. Only you can decide if such a service is right for you, so do some research and see what you think.</p>
<p>Now, let’s talk about what you can do in the situation you’re in, which is that you have little to no real-world working experience in the field.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-232"><a id="_idTextAnchor232"/>Accentuating what you have</h2>
<p>It’s nice when you can describe a dozen high-profile projects that you’ve completed over the last 20 years of professional web <a id="_idIndexMarker904"/>development, but that’s not where anyone starts. Getting your first job in the field will require something else.</p>
<p>The trick is simple in theory but difficult in practice: you must build up whatever you do have, even if it’s not directly related.</p>
<p>What I mean is what I hinted at earlier. Let’s say you haven’t done any web development yet, at least nothing for pay. But maybe you have been a stock person at a Walmart or Target or another big-box retailer. How can you talk up that experience to make it relevant?</p>
<p>Well, a stock person has to have some degree of organizational skills. They must be able to determine the right products to put on the shelves in the proper locations. They might have to be able to put in purchase orders to replenish stocks without over-buying or under-buying. They will need to stock the shelves and do so efficiently, both in terms of time and in terms of how it looks when finished.</p>
<p>In other words, they must pay attention to details, and they must determine a plan of action to effectively reach a set goal. So, say things like that when you describe that work experience!</p>
<p>It’s not dishonest to talk up<a id="_idIndexMarker905"/> whatever work experience you have. By the same token, if you built a personal website, you could talk that up by describing the technology used, how you went about moving from wireframe to prototype to finished product, and how you implemented SEO effectively to raise your search ranking.</p>
<p>Or perhaps you haven’t been out of school very long. If that’s the case, did you do any especially complex assignments? If so, then you can talk about those, taking care to include comments about what you learned and the things you had to overcome to complete it successfully.</p>
<p>You should focus on the skills you’ve cultivated. This is generally true whether you have work experience or not, but it becomes more important if you don’t since you won’t have a lot of choice in the matter. Focus on the languages and technologies you’re proficient in or have experience with, no matter the form or extent of that experience.</p>
<p>You should also focus on “soft skills,” things such as teamwork, problem-solving, and adaptability. And here again, look for places where you can highlight those skills in any form. If you worked on a team project in school, that’s something to talk about in terms of teamwork. If you had to take on multiple sections of the store as a stock person when someone else quit, that’s a good example of adaptability and you can talk it up as such. You should also try to relate these skills and experiences to web development wherever you can, though that may not always be possible in a way that doesn’t seem overly contrived, so be careful with this.</p>
<p>The basic point here is that without a lot of demonstratable work experience in the web development field, you have to look for positives in yourself and in your work and life experiences that you can word in such a way that they show things about you that a prospective employer might find enticing. At the risk of repeating myself, don’t be dishonest in anything you say because that’s just not worth the potential negative consequences. But building yourself and your abilities up, selling yourself in words, that’s not dishonest – that’s just good salesmanship!</p>
<p>Naturally, having something that is web development to show is almost always better and will almost always carry more weight than flowery language alone. Fortunately, this is a field where you can gain such experience and have things to show without having professional work experience, and <a id="_idIndexMarker906"/>that’s where things such as repos, portfolios, and samples come into the picture.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-233"><a id="_idTextAnchor233"/>Having repos, portfolios, and samples to show</h1>
<p>When you go out for your first web developer job, you almost certainly don’t have a long track record to demonstrate your abilities. You may have <em class="italic">something</em> to show – you may have built a personal website, or maybe you built a website for your local church gratis. But you don’t have previous jobs to<a id="_idIndexMarker907"/> point to and say “Here, this shows what I can do.” So, to give yourself the best chance at being hired, you’ll want to build some stuff and make it available for people to see.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-234"><a id="_idTextAnchor234"/>Building websites</h2>
<p>As I just mentioned, a personal <a id="_idIndexMarker908"/>website is often the first thing someone creates, and they do it specifically to show their capabilities. The good thing about such a project is it’s all up to you! You get to decide what it looks like, how it works, what technologies you use to build it, and so on. However, it is certainly a project you should undertake when you feel up to it. To be clear, it doesn’t need to be the best website ever, but it definitely <em class="italic">should</em> be the best website <em class="italic">you can build at that point</em>. You want to be able to point to it and say, “This is what I can do right now.”</p>
<p>While this is a good start, look for opportunities to build for others too. There are frequently non-profit organizations that are more than happy to have a website built for them for free. This provides a needed service to them while allowing you to learn. But unlike a personal website, now, you must meet the needs of a “client,” which demonstrates a whole other set of abilities that a prospective employer would like to see since they, in effect, will be your client if you’re hired.</p>
<p>For the most part, building a website doesn’t let someone see your code, not in its source form at least, and not the backend code. This is where a GitHub repo can come into play.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-235"><a id="_idTextAnchor235"/>Building a GitHub repo</h2>
<p>Another thing you should look to do is build up a GitHub repo (or several). There is some debate online about this because some people you will encounter won’t ever look at these repos, but some will – ultimately, if you’re looking for an entry-level position, potential employees may look at <em class="italic">anything</em> they can find to gauge your skills.</p>
<p>If they do choose to look at it, having a GitHub repo allows an interviewer to see how you write code. They almost <a id="_idIndexMarker909"/>certainly won’t be looking at it super-critically because anyone hiring for an entry-level position has to set their expectations realistically. But seeing a repo from someone who has clean code (formatted well), commented well, and appears to be logically structured can provide them insight into your thought process.</p>
<p>What should you put in your repo? Well, the simple answer is anything! When I was hired the first time, I didn’t have a college degree, nor did I have any experience to point to, aside from some side jobs I had done. So, the code I provided for my interviewer to look at included some video games I had written, some small utilities I wrote for myself, and some demos I had written for some old <strong class="bold">Bulletin Board Systems</strong> (<strong class="bold">BBSs</strong>, which came before the internet). This was <a id="_idIndexMarker910"/>an interview at a financial company, so none of this was relevant to what I would be doing on the job. But what was shown to the interviewer was that I was able to write code, and was able to write it in a way they viewed as reasonable. They told me point-blank a few months later that all of that helped me get the job.</p>
<p>So, any code you write, so long as you ensure it’s written while following good coding practices, is solid content for your repo. It doesn’t matter if it’s related to the industry you’re applying to – it’s more input into the interview process.</p>
<p>But it’s not all about the code, is it? To an extent, it’s also about the artistic side of things, the creative side of things. That’s more what a portfolio is generally for.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-236"><a id="_idTextAnchor236"/>Building a portfolio of sample work</h2>
<p>In art-related jobs or other creative jobs, it’s not unusual to have a portfolio to present during an interview. For artists, this will <a id="_idIndexMarker911"/>frequently be a book with pages of your drawings, showing what you can do and what you can create.</p>
<p>Well, web development is part of art, especially when it comes to the frontend! As such, a portfolio can have some value for you as well. However, it likely won’t be a physical book like it is for an artist (though I bet many artists today don’t use a physical book anymore either!). It can simply be URLs to show websites you’ve built.</p>
<p>There can be some overlap between a portfolio and a GitHub repo. Your repo may also effectively be your portfolio because one of the capabilities GitHub offers is the ability to host websites. You can take a website in a GitHub repo and make it available as a working website.</p>
<p>Regardless, the point here is less about the technical aspect and more about the artistic aspect (though there can certainly be overlap). It’s one thing to see your code and that you wrote it well, but it’s another to look at what’s actually on the screen, what the website is, and see that you<a id="_idIndexMarker912"/> followed good design principles, for example. Or to see that what you created is aesthetically pleasing. This is more what a portfolio is for.</p>
<p>The bottom line in all of this is to look for ways to prove what you can do, to demonstrate your abilities. In working to get your first job, you may have to be a bit creative, and you’ll need to take initiative. It’s one thing when you have years of real-world work experience and can describe what you’ve done for other employers (though you typically can’t show it since it’s proprietary in most cases), but when you don’t have the benefit of that, you still need to provide as much evidence, for lack of a better word, that someone should take a chance on you. Build stuff, put it online – including the code – and use all of it to prove you’re worth hiring, even without that long track record!</p>
<p>At this point, you will hopefully have found some job postings, submitted your resume, prepared your GitHub repo, portfolio, and samples, and are – in theory – ready for an interview. Now, let’s look at interviews and what’s involved with getting through one successfully.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-237"><a id="_idTextAnchor237"/>Understanding a typical web developer interview</h1>
<p>There isn’t a <em class="italic">typical</em> web developer<a id="_idIndexMarker913"/> interview, per se – there is a lot of variety across interviews, and lots of ways people conduct them, so no two are the same generally – but there <em class="italic">are</em> some common patterns, some things that you’re more likely than not to experience. We can group those things and say they represent what we might refer to as a <em class="italic">typical</em> web development interview.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-238"><a id="_idTextAnchor238"/>Understanding the structure</h2>
<p>Most interviews involve multiple <a id="_idIndexMarker914"/>rounds of activity. These rounds may be conducted by one person or by many, individually or in a group setting. They may occur in one day or be spread across several days.</p>
<h3>The initial review round</h3>
<p>In the first round, it’s more likely than not that <a id="_idIndexMarker915"/>you will encounter a review of your resume, where you’ll be asked questions about previous projects and experience. These questions will typically be probing to ensure that what’s listed on your resume is accurate (for example, by asking you to describe how a specific technology listed for a given project was used) and to try to judge how deeply you know these topics. You may get questions such as “Oh, I see you used MongoDB on this project, can you tell me about the data structure you designed?” or maybe “How did you implement sharding in that database?”</p>
<p>At this point, answer the questions directly and try not to editorialize too much. You may find that your nerves start kicking in and you start rambling, or if not because of nerves, then because you think a longer answer must necessarily be better. Try to avoid that, but also avoid being <em class="italic">too</em> short. You don’t want to be seen as babbling on, but you also don’t want to be seen as either not knowing what you claim to know, or not knowing it in depth (unless you specifically say “Yes, I used MongoDB, but I didn’t get into it too deeply, so I can’t claim to be an expert in it,” which is a reasonable answer if it’s the truth).</p>
<h3>The technical round</h3>
<p>After this round, you’re likely to be asked some technical questions. Here, I’m talking about questions along the lines of “What<a id="_idIndexMarker916"/> function can you use to get a reference to a DOM node in JavaScript if you know the element’s ID?” Direct, knowledge-testing questions are what these are. These will, hopefully, be relevant to the job you’re applying for, though that, unfortunately, is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>My advice for handling these types of questions is to answer to the best of your ability, but if you simply don’t know something, then say so. Try to soften the blow as best you can though. For the previous question, you might say something like, “I’m sorry, that’s something I’ve not encountered before, but given a few minutes to research online, I know I could find that answer because I know that a DOM node is the JavaScript representation of an HTML element in the Document Object Model, and I’ve worked with JavaScript, so it should just be a matter of some quick research.” That tells the interviewer that you do have the basic knowledge they’re looking for, but you may have just blanked on the particular function, or it is something you’ve never used, and no one is expected to know every last detail.</p>
<p>During this round, you may be asked to code on a whiteboard (which is something almost everyone hates!). The interviewer may ask, for example, for you to write a bubble sort algorithm on the board in Python. Rest assured that most interviewers do not expect perfection here! Even if your solution is close, that will usually be good enough.</p>
<p>One of the best things you <a id="_idIndexMarker917"/>can do here is to “think out loud” as you work. Verbalize the internal dialogue going on in your head as you work through the problem. This does two things. First, it lets the interviewer have an insight into your thought process, which is good for you because even if your solution doesn’t turn out right, they can hear that you were at least on the right track, and you’ll still get points even for a failed attempt. Second, it will help calm your nerves since speaking out loud in such a situation tends to allow your body to release some of the stress.</p>
<p>And don’t be afraid to correct yourself either! If you start down a wrong path and realize it, saying something like “Oh wait, that won’t work because <em class="italic">X</em>; I need to do <em class="italic">Y</em> instead” is a great thing to hear.</p>
<h3>The getting-to-know-you round</h3>
<p>Most interviews tend to have a more relaxed round after this where it becomes a bit more personal, and a bit more freeform in<a id="_idIndexMarker918"/> nature. Here, you’re being evaluated for cultural fit and, frankly, just to see if you’re someone that people will enjoy interacting with. Here, the goal is simply to be friendly, open, and honest. However, try not to be <em class="italic">too</em> open. You don’t need to reveal all your inner secrets at this point, and you don’t need to talk about every unusual hobby you may have. You can’t prepare for this round in any concrete way other than practicing being a personable individual as best you can.</p>
<p>This is also the round where you generally get a chance to ask some questions about the job and the company. I’ll talk about this in the <em class="italic">Handling common interview questions</em> section, but for now, it’s enough to say that you should try and come prepared with a small handful of questions to ask. An especially good one is simply “Tell me a bit about the culture here; what it’s like to work here?” or something similar. It shows interest, will give the other person a chance<a id="_idIndexMarker919"/> to talk a bit to take a little pressure off you, and can net you some valuable insight into what accepting an offer at that company might mean for you day to day.</p>
<h3>The assignment round</h3>
<p>Another round that you may encounter is a take-home assignment or, sometimes, an on-site assignment. In either<a id="_idIndexMarker920"/> case, it’s when you’ll be asked to build something, some small project to demonstrate your abilities. These aren’t quite as common as the other rounds I’ve described, but some companies do them. You’ll usually be given an assignment that is job-relevant, and you’ll then be given access to a workstation (or you may be allowed to use your own). In most cases, you’ll have more or less free reign to decide what tools you use and how you build the assignment (you may be given some general parameters, such as “We want you to build this with React”). In most cases, you won’t be monitored as you work, but some companies may have someone watching over your shoulder.</p>
<p>There are no real tricks here – you simply have to do the best you can! Choose the tools and technologies you are most comfortable with and focus on writing good, clean code that you can present well – most of the time, that’s what will happen, and you’ll have to walk through your results with the interviewer. They may ask questions about why you did things the way you did, so make sure you can justify every decision.</p>
<p>I must caution you about these sorts of assignments, though: don’t let anyone take advantage of you! Your time is valuable, and some companies will take advantage of that by giving you unreasonable assignments that will take hours to do. Some especially unscrupulous companies may even try to get free work out of you by giving you an assignment that is something they need to get done! You have to use your gut here and decide what’s reasonable and what isn’t. My general rule of thumb is that if you realistically believe you can do the assignment in an hour or less, then that’s probably reasonable. If you think it’ll take longer, then you may want to say “I’m sorry, but I think that assignment will take me an inordinate amount of time to accomplish, so I’m not comfortable with it. Is there something else you can ask of me that won’t take quite as long?”</p>
<p>Some companies may also be willing to pay you for the time spent on the assignment. That’s not common and I’d say you probably shouldn’t expect it, but it’s nice when it happens. In such cases, your tolerance for how long it’ll take may be greater. I would also say that you shouldn’t take on a longer assignment unless you feel like the rest of the interview has gone well and you’re excited about the opportunity the company presents. There’s probably no sense in spending 6 hours coding a login page if it’s a company you were kind of half-hearted about in the first place.</p>
<p>Now that you have some idea <a id="_idIndexMarker921"/>of what an interview might look like, let’s talk about some general things you can do to prepare for a coding-centric interview, aside from the advice I gave in this section.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-239"><a id="_idTextAnchor239"/>Preparing for coding interviews</h2>
<p>A coding interview, or a technical interview generally, can be a very stressful event. It largely comes down, in the simplest terms, to <a id="_idIndexMarker922"/>whether you know the stuff, and proving that you do. When I interview people, that’s the primary thing I’m looking for because whether they have the skills required for the position, what I’m trying to fill is what matters most. It’s not <em class="italic">all</em> that matters, not by a long shot, but it’s the first thing on the list.</p>
<p>One thing that <em class="italic">doesn’t</em> matter, paradoxically, is that a candidate has every answer right on the tip of their tongue. First, we work in a field where that’s a practical impossibility. And second, it’s a field where researching and using reference material is a must. Yes, there are some things I expect that every candidate knows off the top of their head. For example, if I’m trying to hire a frontend developer, I certainly would expect that they can tell me something about the CSS box model. If I’m hiring a Java developer, I’d expect they can tell me what string interning is all about.</p>
<p>But what I’m <em class="italic">not</em> looking for is, for example, if they can tell me every method available on the JavaScript string object or if they know the arguments required for a specific array method. These are things that I expect people to look up when needed (you tend to remember only what you’re using the most and the most recently, so people will tend to know some of this sort of stuff, but never all of it). So, as a candidate, you can relax a little bit in that interviewers aren’t going to expect you to know everything cold.</p>
<p>But at the same time, it’s important that you know as much as possible and be able to demonstrate your abilities.</p>
<p>One of the ways interviewers often try and gauge this is with websites that present coding challenges for you to solve. Two of the most famous are HackerRank (<a href="http://hackerrank.com">hackerrank.com</a>) and LeetCode (<a href="http://leetcode.com">leetcode.com</a>). You may be asked to do some of these challenges during an interview. They usually come in the form of tasks that require you to write some small piece of code, and then the platform confirms if it functions correctly. In theory, it doesn’t matter how you write the code per se – what matters is that it has the specified result, so they aren’t generally looking for specific solutions, just <em class="italic">working</em> solutions (they can, however – and unfortunately – be a bit finicky).</p>
<p>The good news is that these sites are available to you outside of interviews, and they are great ways to not only prepare for an interview that will use them, but also for interviews that won’t, and just<a id="_idIndexMarker923"/> generally to learn about writing code. I most definitely encourage you to use these sites. Work through the challenges and get familiar with how they work and what they look for in your solution. That way, if you are confronted with them in an interview, it won’t be your first time encountering them.</p>
<p>More generally, studying <strong class="bold">data structure and algorithms</strong> (<strong class="bold">DS&amp;A</strong>)  is an important step. If you’ve never heard these terms<a id="_idIndexMarker924"/> before, let me explain.</p>
<p>In simplest terms, <strong class="bold">data structures</strong> are standard ways of storing data. For example, an array is a data structure – one that is <a id="_idIndexMarker925"/>built into almost every programming language. You can use the basic capabilities of a language and build more advanced structures – things such as lists (a more robust form of array in essence), stacks (also like an array, but where elements can only go in or come out in well-defined specific ways,) and maps (which equate a key to a value, allowing you to look up values by their keys). These are some of the simplest examples.</p>
<p>And the term <strong class="bold">algorithms</strong> is just a complex way of saying a set of programming instructions to perform a specific task. For <a id="_idIndexMarker926"/>example, there are many ways you can sort data and many different algorithms that you can choose from. Some will work better if your data is already mostly in order, others might slow down the more data there is to sort, and still others will use more CPU power to get the job done regardless. Knowing these different algorithms and their trade-offs is something you may be expected to know during an interview and on the job.</p>
<p>But during an interview specifically, you might be asked to implement a two-way linked list. However, it’s more important to know what that is and how and when to apply it than it is to know how to implement it yourself – in most cases on the job, you wouldn’t be implementing it yourself, you would use a ready-made version. While it’s valuable to know how to invert a binary tree because that could be something you’re asked to do on a whiteboard, it’s even more valuable to know what a binary tree is and why we use them and be able to explain that because that’s what you’ll need on the job. Sites such as HackerRank and LeetCode are largely based on requiring you to implement such DS&amp;A solutions, so studying<a id="_idIndexMarker927"/> them more generally will help you handle those sites and tests on them.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Finding more information on DS&amp;A</p>
<p class="callout">The topic of data structures and algorithms is an expansive one and is a bit outside the scope of this book except in general terms. However, to dig deeper, some resources you may consider are MIT’s OpenCourseWare website (<a href="https://ocw.mit.edu">https://ocw.mit.edu</a>), which provides free courses with interactive content from the famous Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Harvard’s <em class="italic">CS50: Introduction to Computer Science</em> material (<a href="https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science">https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science</a>); and good ‘ole YouTube! Just search for “data structure and algorithms” and you’ll find a whole host of good content (be sure to always choose those with a lot of upvotes since that <em class="italic">tends</em> to indicate quality, as judged by the community of viewers at least).</p>
<p>Now, let’s look at one of the biggest challenges that you’ll face during a technical interview, beyond the technical knowledge itself, and that’s dealing with the stress of it all!</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-240"><a id="_idTextAnchor240"/>Dealing with the stress</h2>
<p>I have mentioned a few times that interviews can be stressful situations. Most people aren’t especially comfortable being what <a id="_idIndexMarker928"/>may feel like being interrogated.  There isn’t any magic bullet solution that will make most interviews easy, but knowing what to expect going in and having some coping strategies is helpful. Let’s look at some of them now:</p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic">Preparation</em>: Obviously, studying and knowing your stuff is a key thing to do. Take some time to review the basics – it’s easy to get flummoxed when you’re asked a question that you know is basic and easy, but you blank on it, and this happens to everyone! Also, be sure to bone up on any specific technologies mentioned in the job description, even if you don’t have much (or any) experience with them. I can tell you that for my first interview, I was asked questions about Visual FoxPro. I had never used that before, but because it was listed in the job description, I bought a book about it and read it before the interview. As a result, I was able to answer some questions that the interviewer later told me no one else could.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Do mock interviews</em>: If you have friends or family willing to do so, let them play interviewer and run you<a id="_idIndexMarker929"/> through the wringer! Some websites can help you do mock interviews, including Pramp (<a href="http://pramp.com">pramp.com</a>) <a href="http://interviewing.io">interviewing.io</a> (that’s both the site name and the URL!), and even HackerRank and LeetCode offer some of this functionality. These might be better choices than your friends or family since you may be a bit too comfortable <a id="_idIndexMarker930"/>with friends and family, and the goal here is to <em class="italic">not</em> be comfortable in a more controlled setting than a real interview.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Mindfulness techniques</em>: Breathing exercises or meditation before the interview can help calm your nerves and get you into a good headspace.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Shifting your perspective</em>: Remember that an interview is a two-way street. You’re also assessing if the company is a good fit for you. This can emotionally give you a small sense of power, which can lead to not feeling overwhelmed.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Stay positive</em>: No matter how you think the interview is going, focus on learning from the experience right from the start. If you’re sitting there thinking “I’m bombing this!” then take a moment to ask yourself exactly what’s going wrong. Obviously, in the middle of an interview, you’re probably not going to be able to sit there with a blank stare on your face while you consider the question! But you can kind of subconsciously process the question, and whether that allows you to make adjustments on the fly or simply consider what you’ll do better next time, it can reframe what’s happening more positively.</li>
<li><em class="italic">Post-interview analysis</em>: Regardless of the outcome, be sure to reflect on what went well and what could be improved for next time when you’re done. This is an extension of the previous point, but it’s more focused on lessons learned and improving, not on helping you during the interview.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next thing to consider is the impression you give to the interviewer, and what you can do to ensure it’s a positive one.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-241"><a id="_idTextAnchor241"/>Presenting the best you</h2>
<p>As you work your way through the interview process, in whatever form it takes, always remember to present yourself both <a id="_idIndexMarker931"/>professionally and friendly. Smile, make eye contact, and stay in the moment. Don’t let anything else into your mind beyond that interview because, in that moment, it’s all that matters.</p>
<p>Make sure you dress for success too. Even if you know that the environment of the company is casual dress, wear professional attire for the interview (I would suggest doing this even if you’re explicitly told you can dress casually, though that is perhaps debatable). We’re not talking about a tuxedo here, or even a suit and tie or an expensive pantsuit. Slacks and a collared shirt will be acceptable for both women and men in most environments.</p>
<p>Ensure your grooming is impeccable as well. It’s all about presenting a picture of yourself that is positive to most people. You can never be sure how someone will react to you, but you can’t control that – you can only control yourself. Ensuring you don’t look slovenly is something you can control.</p>
<p>This will make you come across as someone who is professional and focused and who has good attention to detail thinking, which is exactly what you want to get across when you’re trying for a position where those things matter, as they do in web development.</p>
<p>But no matter how well-prepared you are, it’s still entirely possible that you’ll run into a bad interviewer. Given that, let’s talk about what you might be able to do if you find yourself in that unenviable position.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-242"><a id="_idTextAnchor242"/>Protecting yourself</h2>
<p>At the end of the day, being interviewed is difficult. But so too is conducting interviews. It may not seem like it should be, but it is. Asking good questions is difficult. Judging people is difficult. Ensuring fairness<a id="_idIndexMarker932"/> is difficult. It’s a skill all of its own that takes time to cultivate and develop, and unfortunately, before that happens, many people are not very good at it. Given that, as a candidate, you should take steps to protect yourself as best as you can.</p>
<p>For example, you may sometimes run into an interviewer who doesn’t want to be there. Maybe they have a ton of work to do themselves and feel like they don’t have the time to do an interview. They may be distracted, constantly checking their phone, for example. As a result, they may rush through the interview and wind up not giving you a fair shake. There frankly isn’t a whole lot you can do in such a situation. Your best bet is to remain friendly and try to provide succinct but still meaningful answers. Be careful not to meander since that will likely just exacerbate the situation. If, on the other hand, they sense that you’re trying to be respectful of their time, their demeanor may change.</p>
<p>Or you may run into someone who doesn’t know how to construct good questions. They may ask you very open-ended questions (which sometimes is done on purpose, but often not), or things that are highly opinion-based (which, again, can be valid questions in some cases). They may ask questions that are worded confusingly, or that you judge to have no real valid answer. The best thing you can probably do in such cases is ask for clarification (politely and <a id="_idIndexMarker933"/>respectfully, of course). Make sure you understand what’s being asked as best you can by confirming your understanding. “Okay, so I think what you’re asking me is how does a closure in JavaScript work, is that right?” is a good question to ask to make sure you’re understanding what’s being asked.</p>
<p>You may occasionally run into an interviewer who is more interested in impressing you with what they know, or otherwise being intimidating. There’s no easy answer to dealing with this, but it generally comes down to believing in yourself and having confidence. Be sure to maintain good eye contact and a steady posture because body language most definitely matters during an interview. If you sense that they’re trying to impress you with their knowledge, go ahead and let them use it as a learning opportunity! They may very well have a lot they could teach you, so you might as well pay attention and remain positive about the situation by viewing it as a chance to grow your knowledge.</p>
<p>Being asked irrelevant questions is something else that often happens with bad interviewers. To them, of course, the questions <em class="italic">are</em> relevant, but probably not in a way that makes much sense. To handle these, ask for clarification first, because maybe the questions <em class="italic">are</em> relevant in a way you just haven’t seen. If not, do your best to steer the conversation back to your skills and abilities relevant to the role. And always remember that if a question strikes you as offensive or overly personal, you have every right to simply refuse to answer it. How best to do that is tricky, but I would go with something like “I’m sorry but I’m not comfortable answering that question” and leave it at that.</p>
<p>Beyond the stress, potentially poor interviewers, and needing to know your technical material, there are some fairly common questions that you may encounter, and having a game plan for answering them going in is a good idea, so let’s tackle some of those now.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-243"><a id="_idTextAnchor243"/>Handling common interview questions</h1>
<p>Aside from the technical angle, some non-technical questions tend to be asked during interviews, and at least some of them are pretty common. They may be asked in varying ways, but they kind of boil down to the same basic question regardless. Here, I’ll attempt to generalize them as <a id="_idIndexMarker934"/>much as possible and talk about how you might want to answer them (with an underlying point being that you always want to answer them <em class="italic">truthfully</em>, of course).</p>
<p>Note that this is in no way meant to be an exhaustive list. What I’ve done is, through a bit of research, coupled with my personal experience on both sides of the table, come up with what are probably the 10 most popular such questions. Naturally, you must be ready for others, or indeed none of them! It’s not a given that you’ll be asked such questions during an interview, and it’s certainly not a given it’ll be these specific questions. But they are common enough that I think they’re worth calling out, and if nothing else, they should get you to start thinking about such questions, which should help prepare you for any others that may come up.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-244"><a id="_idTextAnchor244"/>Tell me about yourself</h2>
<p>This is a completely open-ended question that you could go many ways with. But primarily, you should focus on your professional journey, highlighting relevant experiences and achievements. When you don’t have much (or any) professional experience yet, highlight whatever you can. For example, if you’re very into contributing to open source projects, then certainly mention that. If you love writing games, talk about that a bit.</p>
<p>In general, try to convey that you are enthusiastic about the field, technology, and learning. You can get into your personal life a little bit but try to relate it to professional life. There’s nothing wrong per se with talking about your hobbies – unless they might be considered inappropriate of course – but that’s probably not what the interviewer is interested in hearing. They want to hear about how you’re the type of person who will do well in the role you’re interviewing for, so focus on that in any way you can.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-245"><a id="_idTextAnchor245"/>Why do you want to work here?</h2>
<p>This can be looked at as a bit of a trick question because the obvious answer for all of us is “Because I need to earn money and you’ve got an opening!” But in reality, this is an opportunity to demonstrate that this isn’t just another job interview for you (even if it is). To do that, show that you’ve researched the company a bit. Talk about how the company’s mission aligns with your values and how you’d love to be a part of making that mission a success.</p>
<p>As I’ve said several times, don’t be dishonest here. If your values don’t align with those of the company, you probably shouldn’t be applying there in the first place. But if the mission of the company doesn’t exactly excite you, it’s still possible to say something like “I like solving problems and building complex things, and the mission of this company will give me a<a id="_idIndexMarker935"/> chance to exercise those skills.” But if you haven’t researched the company at all, then you couldn’t say something like that.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-246"><a id="_idTextAnchor246"/>What are your greatest strengths?</h2>
<p>The key to answering this question well is to choose strengths that are relevant to the role you’re applying for and be able to give examples to demonstrate those strengths.</p>
<p>For example, for a web developer position, you should think about strengths that demonstrate your ability to solve problems, your ability to take rough designs and translate them to finished products, your ability to be creative, and your ability to learn new things. This could be done by, for example, telling a story about a project you worked on where you had to pick up new skills as you designed and built a personal website, or programmed a game.</p>
<p>If you’ve done your research and know that the company uses cloud providers, you might want to put additional focus on the time you experimented with Microsoft Azure, even if what you built wasn’t anything special. Then, take this specific example and say something more generic, such as the fact that you had never worked with Azure before, so you had to learn as you went, and along the way, you had to solve how to set up authentication, for example.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-247"><a id="_idTextAnchor247"/>What is your greatest weakness?</h2>
<p>This is a question that people typically like to try and answer in a “tricky” way. For example, you might say that sometimes, you get so engrossed in what you’re doing that you work longer hours than you should because that makes it seem like you’re dedicated. In other words, you might try to turn a negative into a positive. To be sure, that <em class="italic">can</em> work if done properly. However, there’s a great chance that you’ll come across as insincere or cagey, and that’s something you want to avoid at all costs during an interview.</p>
<p>Instead, since not a single one of us is perfect, try to find a real weakness in yourself and present it honestly. Granted, you probably don’t want to choose a <em class="italic">big</em> one (“I like to take office supplies home every chance I get!” probably isn’t in your best interest, for example). You probably don’t want to say that you frequently enjoy crashing your car into coffee shops! But it’s not usually hard to find something that isn’t monstrous that is a weakness. You might say something like “I sometimes find myself temporarily panicking if I don’t know something immediately,” which is something we all experience.</p>
<p>Then – and this is <a id="_idIndexMarker936"/>the key – talk about how you’re working to improve yourself in that area. Maybe you might say “To try and deal with that panic, I’ve been actively seeking out situations where I’ll be forced to deal with new technologies so that I can work to overcome it.” It shows that you’re honest, introspective, and willing to make corrections as needed.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-248"><a id="_idTextAnchor248"/>Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</h2>
<p>This is another one of those open-ended questions where there are not any right or wrong answers. The trick is to simply <em class="italic">have</em> an answer.</p>
<p>You probably shouldn’t be overly grandiose with your answer. It’s perfectly fine if, in your mind, your answer would be “I want to be the CEO!” but that’s probably not the best answer to give.</p>
<p>First, it’ll probably not be seen as realistic – a trait that most people generally tend to value in people who work for them – and might even get you laughed at (if only silently). It’s good to have big goals, but there are a lot of steps between that goal and where you are now, and people want to see that you aren’t looking too far over the horizon and being unrealistic.</p>
<p>Second, that answer may imply that you’ll be looking to move up or even out of the company as quickly as possible in the interest of your career goals. Look at it from their perspective: why put in all the time and effort to hire you, train you, get you up to speed and ready to be productive in the position they need filling, just to see you move on to another position (whether to another company or just to another position in the same company) at the first chance you get? From their perspective, that’s a lot of wasted time and effort at that point, depending on how long you were in that role.</p>
<p>So, you want to strike a balance between being ambitious and not being so ambitious that they think you won’t want to do the job they’re<a id="_idIndexMarker937"/> hiring for, and they’ll lose you before they get a decent <strong class="bold">return on investment</strong> (<strong class="bold">ROI</strong>). Because remember, you very much <em class="italic">are</em> an investment from their perspective!</p>
<p>You should also try to align your career goals with opportunities at the company, and this again comes from research. It’s okay to say something like “In 5 years, I hope to be a team lead” because it shows you have ambition but that those ambitions will likely keep you there for a while, and it’s not an unrealistic goal either. They may appreciate such a goal because it probably indicates you’re going to work hard and produce good results in the interests of your <a id="_idIndexMarker938"/>career advancement, but that effort will be aiding them all along. Demonstrating a win-win situation if you’re hired is a good goal to keep in mind!</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-249"><a id="_idTextAnchor249"/>Why should we hire you?</h2>
<p>For this type of question, you’ll want to explain how you can contribute to what the company does, and how your skills and experiences line up with the job requirements. Obviously, for a web development position, spelling out how you have learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and how you can put them to work building real websites, is key.</p>
<p>You’ll also want to demonstrate enthusiasm for the position, though without going overboard to the point of it sounding forced. Something along the lines of “I enjoy the challenges inherent in web development and I believe my skills will allow me to do that effectively for you” might be a good starting point.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-250"><a id="_idTextAnchor250"/>Describe a challenge you faced and how you overcame it</h2>
<p>This is one of the easier questions to answer because, let’s face it, we’ve all had challenges to overcome – and hopefully we’ve all overcome them! Here, we’re talking about challenges that would be work-related, whether that was on the job or not.</p>
<p>Be sure to use specific examples and to focus on your problem-solving approach and the eventual outcome. The challenges you discuss – one or two will suffice – could be big or small, so long as they demonstrate how you dealt with them effectively. Maybe you could talk about the time you spent hours fighting with some CSS to get a website’s layout just right. Or it could be the time your PC was acting weird, and you had to do a bunch of research and registry editing to get the problem resolved. Anything that shows you can tackle problems, fight through them, research, learn, and reason is what’s important.</p>
<p>Note that you usually wouldn’t want to discuss any sort of personal challenges here. However, as someone looking for an entry-level position, this may be all you have. Maybe your car broke down and you had to deal with that. Or perhaps there was a bad rainstorm and your house’s roof was leaking and you had to put together a makeshift patch to keep your house from flooding. So long as you highlight how you overcame the challenges and how you approached them, as well as your thought process for dealing with them, they can be okay as an answer if it’s all you have.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-251"><a id="_idTextAnchor251"/>How do you handle stress or pressure?</h2>
<p>This question goes along hand-in-hand with the previous one because when we’re facing technical challenges, we’re also facing some level of stress and pressure. How you handle that is something a prospective employer will want to know.</p>
<p>The way to answer this is just like the last question: provide specific examples of tough situations and explain how and why they made you feel tense. Then, explain any coping mechanisms you <a id="_idIndexMarker939"/>utilized to deal with them. Maybe you regularly use various breathing exercises. Or your answer could be that you sought assistance from someone with more knowledge of the topic at hand than you had. Anything that demonstrates that you know how to handle stress and won’t wilt under pressure is what someone is looking for here.</p>
<p>You also might want to mention any proactive stress management techniques you use, and this is an area where getting a little bit personal is probably more acceptable. For example, if you like to fish because it’s relaxing, that’s okay to mention. However, remember that primarily, the goal is to show what you’ll be able to do and handle on the job, so trying to relate your answer to a work environment will be helpful.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-252"><a id="_idTextAnchor252"/>What are your salary expectations?</h2>
<p>This is always a difficult question and leads to the much larger topic of negotiations, which is something that many people aren’t comfortable with. To help answer this question, be sure to research industry standards and norms before getting to the interview so that you have realistic expectations (I covered this in the first few chapters, but this is data that changes all the time, so you’ll want to research a bit right before the interview).</p>
<p>You’ll want to be honest about what you’re looking for but be open to some degree of negotiating. There is usually some flexibility from the hiring side when it comes to salary, but it will depend on a lot of factors, some of which you’ll have no control over. So, avoid saying something like ‘Well, I know web developers make <em class="italic">X</em>, so this is what I want.” Instead, say something like “Well, based on my research, a range of <em class="italic">X</em> to <em class="italic">Y</em> seems to be the norm, so I’m looking for something in that range.” Just be sure that the low end of that range is a number you’ll be happy with because it’s natural for the hirer to want to be closer to that end of the range.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it’s up to you whether to accept any offer, so you can be as firm with this answer or as flexible with it as you want. If you price yourself way out of their comfort zone, then that’s a position you weren’t going to get anyway to be blunt, so while some flexibility is good, don’t allow yourself to be lowballed either.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-253"><a id="_idTextAnchor253"/>Do you have any questions for us?</h2>
<p>Finally, we come to<a id="_idIndexMarker940"/> a question that will normally be the last one asked in most interviews, and it’s one you should prepare for with research. You’ll want to have two to three good questions queued up. If you don’t have any questions at all, then it tends to imply a lack of interest or engagement, something you don’t want to ever show in an interview.</p>
<p>You can ask about things such as team structure, what the company culture is like, what a typical workday would be like for your position, or about specific projects if your research turned up any. You can ask about work/life balance (which is coming up next!) and what’s on the horizon for the company in terms of projects that you might be involved with.</p>
<p>Don’t go overboard, though! If you ask too many questions, or questions that require long, in-depth answers, then you run the risk of being seen as not respectful of the interviewer’s time. So, two to three questions is a good rule of thumb, assuming they can all be answered in a minute or two. And it’s okay to ask follow-up questions based on the answers, but again, remember to not start taking up too much of the interviewer’s time.</p>
<p>So, let’s say that you’ve landed your first web developer job through a lot of hard work and preparation. Congratulations! There’s one last thing I want to discuss, and that’s the idea of work/life balance.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-254"><a id="_idTextAnchor254"/>Remembering that it’s not all about work</h1>
<p>This chapter is focused on getting you a job, getting you to attain gainful employment in the web development field. But as Homer Simpson said, “All work and no play make Homer something something.” That, of course, was a humorous reference to the famous movie The Shining, where the main character goes crazy, ostensibly from focusing too much on work (well, it may have had something to do with the spirits living in the inn he was at too, but we’ll put that part aside for our purposes here!).</p>
<p>So, while this section isn’t about landing your first job, I believe it’s about something that is an important enough consideration that you should have it in the back of your mind all along, even as you’re on<a id="_idIndexMarker941"/> the hunt for that first job: work/life balance.</p>
<p>Burnout can be a big problem in any “knowledge worker” industry, including IT (probably in any industry generally, but it seems to be a bigger problem for knowledge workers). This is especially true when you love solving problems and creating things because you’ll work longer and harder than you probably should in service of those goals just because you get so wrapped up in what you’re doing. You’ll hear about “the zone” sometimes, or “the flow,” and it’s a real thing. It takes time to build up mental models of what you’re working on, and any interruption sets you back, but it also means that once you’re in that flow state, you tend to forget the world around you a little bit.</p>
<p>And to be clear, to a certain extent, there’s nothing wrong with that! There’s nothing wrong with loving what you do, with enjoying the work. There’s nothing wrong with being engrossed with what you’re doing.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-255"><a id="_idTextAnchor255"/>Loving your work too much</h2>
<p>But it’s easy to take that too far, especially when “crunch time” hits, and that’s when it becomes dangerous. This is where your work/life balance sometimes goes out of whack.</p>
<p>You’ll sometimes encounter the phrase “death march” when it comes to development projects. That’s when there’s a looming deadline that <em class="italic">must</em> be met, and you’ll sometimes find people working very long hours. You’ll sometimes see people putting in 12 or 14 hours a day, 7 days a week, to meet that date.</p>
<p>This, simply put, is dangerous, and it’s also counterproductive. You can’t keep your brain in high gear for too long or your productivity begins to drop precipitously. Even if that weren’t the case, humans are emotional beings, and the emotional toll of putting so much focus on your working life and neglecting the rest of your life leads to bad consequences at some point.</p>
<p>It’s a difficult thing to do when you’re starting because you don’t quite understand why it can be so destructive, and you also want to put on a good performance, so to speak. You don’t want to appear to be the developer who doesn’t put in the extra effort. You were hired, and now you’ve got to produce, and if that means extra hours, then so be it – that’s the mentality people tend to have naturally.</p>
<p>But I strongly encourage you to fight that urge and push back when necessary. Don’t allow the job to become your life, unless that’s explicitly what you want, of course. Some people do want to live, eat, and sleep the job. If that’s you, then forget what I’m saying here and carry on! But that is generally not most people. Most people want a life outside of work, and you’ve<a id="_idIndexMarker942"/> got to fight for that sometimes.</p>
<p>To be clear, a few extra hours here and there shouldn’t be too big a deal. Sometimes, it’s necessary. Especially if there is a major problem with your production system, the system that the world is using to conduct business, you may have to put in a little extra time and effort to right the ship, so to speak. But even then, good companies will compensate you for your time – if not financially, then at least by letting you, for example, leave a bit early the next day to balance the scales. And you shouldn’t be shy about asking for that either.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-256"><a id="_idTextAnchor256"/>Sussing out bad companies</h2>
<p>Not all companies are good, unfortunately, so you can’t expect it, but that’s where this part of the conversation does have some bearing on the job hunt: always remember that you’re interviewing the prospective employer just as much as they’re interviewing you!</p>
<p>Ask questions about work/life balance and gauge their responses. Sometimes, there will be hints of a bad situation… phrases like “well, we expect everyone to put in the effort required here”, or something along those lines, might indicate an environment that doesn’t value work/life balance. Why? Because of how one person defines “required” versus how another does. Of course, every employer expects a solid effort from the employees, and that’s perfectly reasonable. But expecting you to always go above and beyond probably isn’t. So, you have to figure out what they mean.</p>
<p>You can do that by probing a bit more in such situations and decide for yourself because there are no absolutes here, no definitive statements that will always be a red flag (aside from obvious things like “we always expect everyone to work more than 40 hours a week,” but it’ll rarely be <em class="italic">that</em> obvious!). Companies do often give away their lack of work/life balance in what they say during interviews in sometimes subtle ways – that’s the key point – and you should always be looking for such clues and probe a bit. Asking, for example, “How often do your engineers have to work extra hours on weekends?” might be one such probing question you could ask. An answer along the lines of “It’s very rare, only in extreme emergencies” is very different from “Well, it depends on how tight our deadlines our.” The former is generally reasonable, but the latter, in my mind at least, would tend to indicate a company that doesn’t manage projects well and expects developers to pick<a id="_idIndexMarker943"/> up the slack frequently. It probably won’t equate to a pleasant environment to work in.</p>
<p>Couple that with researching the company yourself and you can reach a valid conclusion. Sites such as Glassdoor (<a href="http://glassdoor.com">glassdoor.com</a>) are good for this because you can find anonymous feedback about <a id="_idIndexMarker944"/>a company there from actual employees of the company that can provide you solid insight into what working there might be like.</p>
<p>You’ll be inclined early on in your job hunt to dismiss such concerns, but I implore you not to! You don’t want to find yourself hating your job a year later because you’re always having to work long hours that drain your non-working hours away. That’s something that leads to burnout in a hurry. So, don’t be afraid to ask probing questions during the interview process – do some research before and after an interview, and trust your gut. If an opportunity gives you pause then, no matter how much you may need a job, it’s probably best to keep looking. Work/life balance is too important to sacrifice in my opinion.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-257"><a id="_idTextAnchor257"/>Reviewing the roadmap</h1>
<p>As we wrap up the technical-focused<a id="_idIndexMarker945"/> part of this book, you’ve got a few more items uncovered. In <em class="italic">Figure 9</em><em class="italic">.1</em>, you can see the updated web developer roadmap:</p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.1: The roadmap, with a few more boxes filled in</p>
<p>With this chapter, you started to <a id="_idIndexMarker946"/>uncover the <strong class="bold">Career Path</strong> branch, along with the <strong class="bold">Demonstrated Abilities</strong>, <strong class="bold">Interview Skills</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Code Tests</strong> squares. In the next chapter, we should be able to complete the entire <strong class="bold">Career </strong><strong class="bold">Path</strong> branch!</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-258"><a id="_idTextAnchor258"/>Summary</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we discussed finding your first job in the web development world. We looked at the term FAANG, what it means, and how it impacts your job search. We looked at some ways to find job openings online, and we looked at building a good resume in preparation for applying. We also discussed Git repos, portfolios, and samples to show and demonstrate your abilities. We then talked about interviews, what they might be like, how to handle them, and how to answer some common questions that come up, generally preparing you for the interview experience. Finally, we talked about how it’s important to keep work in balance with your non-work life to avoid burnout.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we’ll talk about what comes after you land that first job and things you can do to help ensure your success. We’ll look at the good habits of good developers and the things you should keep in mind as you build experience in the field to help build your career.</p>
