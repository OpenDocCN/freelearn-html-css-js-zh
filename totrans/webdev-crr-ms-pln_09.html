<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.1">Okay, so, you’ve spent a lot of time and expended a lot of calories learning the technical side of web development. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.2">You’ve built some code and you now think you’re ready for the next step: landing your first job and starting your web development career. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.3.3">But how do you actually </span><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.4.1">do</span></em></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.5.1"> that?!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.1">I’m old enough to remember a time when getting a job meant looking at wanted ads in physical newspapers (ugh, I hate writing that!), but nowadays, that’s rarely how people find jobs. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.2">And even then, once you find a job opening, the process of applying, interviewing, and ultimately getting a job isn’t usually just a one-time chat with a manager, particularly in web development. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.6.3">You may have to impress more than one person to become an employed </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.7.1">web developer.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.8.1">I’m also old enough and experienced enough in this field that I’ve been through several interviews myself, and perhaps more importantly, I’ve </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.9.1">conducted</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.1"> hundreds of interviews. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.10.2">That means I know what it’s like to be on both sides of the table – I know how terrifying being the candidate can be, and I know how immensely difficult it is to conduct a good interview (seriously, it seems like it’s just asking questions, but doing it well and fairly is </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.11.1">so</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.1"> much harder than it seems). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.12.2">I’m going to take all that knowledge and experience and roll it into this chapter, hopefully to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.13.1">your benefit!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.14.1">With that in mind, this chapter will give you the knowledge you need to find job openings in web development, how to apply for them, what the interviews might be like, how you can effectively prep for them and handle them, and a few other topics that I feel are important to keep in the back of your mind, such as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.15.1">work/life balance.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.33.1">I touched on FAANG briefly in </span><a href="B18315_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><span class="No-Break"><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.34.1">Chapter 1</span></em></span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.35.1">, but let’s dig deeper and get into some </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.36.1">related ideas.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.1">If you go online right now and look at several of the most popular subreddits on Reddit, or on many other sites where people gather to discuss how to get a job in the IT field, you’ll very quickly come across a common term stating that there’s only one target and one way into this field, and that term is FAANG. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.37.2">What does it mean and why do people focus on it </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.38.1">so much?</span></span></p>
<p><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.39.1">FAANG</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.40.1"> stands for </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.41.1">Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.42.2">It began in stock market circles to refer to the</span><a id="_idIndexMarker875"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.43.1"> largest, most</span><a id="_idIndexMarker876"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.1"> well-known tech stocks. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.44.2">Nowadays, there are several other acronyms you might </span><a id="_idIndexMarker877"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.45.1">see, such as </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.46.1">FAAMG</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.47.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.48.1">Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Google</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.49.1">), </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.50.1">MAMAA</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.51.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.52.1">Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.53.1">), and </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.54.1">MATANA</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.55.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.56.1">Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, Alphabet, Nvidia, </span></strong><span class="No-Break"><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.57.1">and Amazon</span></strong></span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.58.1">).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.59.1">We’ll let the stock boys sort</span><a id="_idIndexMarker878"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.1"> out which acronym they think makes the most sense for their realm, but for developers, FAANG is most often used to refer to the biggest, most well-paying, and best-for-your-career companies to work at. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.2">It’s less about specific companies and more so about companies that are viewed favorably from a tech employment standpoint. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.3">Some companies can still be considered a “FAANG company,” even if they’re not one of the five listed. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.60.4">Companies such as Airbnb, Samsung, Oracle, Adobe, Cisco, Qualcomm, eBay, and Uber might be considered FAANG companies by some people, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.61.1">for example.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.1">Online, you’ll see a lot of conversations about joining FAANG companies – regardless of exactly which companies are represented in the acronym – talking about the companies that will look best on your resumes going forward. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.2">Or talking about the companies where the best and brightest tend to work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.3">Or talking about the companies where you’ll bust your butt working but will be rewarded financially and in cache because other developers will almost look upon you with awe. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.62.4">Or all of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.63.1">the above!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.1">To be clear: yes, these types of companies tend to pay very well. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.2">And yes, these companies do tend to look good on a resume. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.64.3">And yes, working there will be challenging but rewarding because you will be working with a lot of top-notch engineers and the latest tech, and you’ll be</span><a id="_idIndexMarker879"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.1"> working on some exciting products that will probably affect a lot of people’s lives. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.2">But they aren’t the best choice for everyone, and most likely aren’t the best choice for someone just starting. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.3">Still, how do you make that decision for yourself? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.65.4">Let’s talk about that </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.66.1">a bit.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-222"><a id="_idTextAnchor222"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.67.1">Calibrating your FAANG expectations</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.1">What I’ve said so far is all good stuff and it’s easy to understand why so many developers are excited by the opportunity to work at such companies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.68.2">But I see a lot of people in online discussions making a big mistake when it comes to FAANG: they think it’s the only way to fame</span><a id="_idIndexMarker880"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.1"> and riches and they think there is nowhere else to work where you can do exciting work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.69.2">Some also make the mistake of thinking that simply graduating college with a CS degree is enough to get you in the door in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.70.1">such companies.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.1">None of that is true. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.71.2">There are great opportunities elsewhere, and most of them will be a lot easier to land than at </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.72.1">FAANG companies.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.1">To be blunt: as an entry-level developer, your odds of being hired at any FAANG or FAANG-like company are pretty low. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.73.2">These companies are looking for the cream of the crop and, more importantly, people who can </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.74.1">prove</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.1"> they are just that. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.2">You could be the best developer out there right now but if you don’t have a track record, it may not be outright impossible to be hired at a FAANG, but it’s certainly not something you should bank on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.75.3">Even people with a lot of experience and a proven track record of success often find it difficult to get hired at such companies because the interview process is so rigorous (a topic I’ll get into more later in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.76.1">this chapter).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.1">Don’t let that blunt your enthusiasm, though! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.2">As I said, there are great opportunities outside of FAANG companies – positions that tend to be somewhat easier to get. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.3">While working at a FAANG will bolster your resume, working at a non-FAANG company will tend to offer you a gentler introduction to the professional IT world. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.77.4">Many companies are using the latest technology too, so you’ll have almost as much opportunity to learn on the job but with a bit less stress and high expectations as you will be when placed at </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.78.1">a FAANG.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.79.1">It’s not strictly FAANG </span><a id="_idIndexMarker881"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.1">versus non-FAANG, though. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.80.2">There’s another divide to be aware of besides FAANG versus non-FAANG, and that’s tech companies versus </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.81.1">non-tech companies.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-223"><a id="_idTextAnchor223"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.82.1">Comparing tech companies to non-tech companies</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.1">Tech companies are those that produce products – specifically tech products – and sell them to customers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.2">Apple is a great example of this. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.83.3">They create iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks, among many other gadgets, all of </span><a id="_idIndexMarker882"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.1">which are tech products. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.2">Their entire focus is on making those products and developing the tech in them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.84.3">Tech is therefore central to what they do because it essentially </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.85.1">is</span></em> <span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.86.1">the product.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.1">By contrast, take a company such as Wells Fargo. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.2">They’re a financial company, so things such as checking accounts, credit cards, and mutual funds are their products. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.3">But there is a lot of tech that goes into making their products possible, it’s just that the tech isn’t the product they sell directly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.4">Tech is something that enables their core product offerings. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.5">At such a company, you, as a developer, might create a system that’s used to reconcile daily account activity, but that system isn’t what gets sold to customers – likely, they wouldn’t even know about it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.87.6">Wells Fargo is a non-tech company because while tech is a key ingredient in what they do, that tech isn’t the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.88.1">end product.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.1">FAANG companies tend to be tech companies (some would blur the line certainly, but as a broad generality, this is true). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.89.2">And tech companies – I think it’s obvious to say – tend to have a higher bar for their tech people simply because it’s necessitated by the products </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.90.1">they produce.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.1">The conclusion from all of this is that when looking for your first job, my advice would be to look for non-tech, non-FAANG positions first. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.2">I don’t want to give a false impression that they’ll be easy to get – landing your first job in IT is going to be a challenge no matter what experience you have – but it will be comparatively a lot easier than a tech company, especially a FAANG. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.91.3">They will allow you to build up that experience, and your track record, at which point you can target tech companies and even FAANGs more effectively and up your odds of success in landing such </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.92.1">a position.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.1">Of course, that isn’t to say you should ignore such tech companies entirely. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.2">Definitely not! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.3">If a good opportunity presents itself then by all means, go for it! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.93.4">But you need to set realistic expectations and tailor your job search based on those expectations, and non-tech companies are often a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.94.1">better bet.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.95.1">At this point, you understand</span><a id="_idIndexMarker883"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.1"> what a FAANG is, and you understand tech companies versus non-tech companies. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.96.2">Now, let’s talk about how you can go about finding job opportunities out in the world regardless of the kind of company you want to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.97.1">apply to.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-224"><a id="_idTextAnchor224"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.98.1">Using the web to become a web developer!</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.1">Being a web developer means being able to use the web, and that might as well start with finding a web developer job! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.2">Today, it’s probably more common to find a job online rather than any other way. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.3">Fortunately, because it’s so common, it has become pretty easy. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.99.4">To begin with, there are many sites dedicated to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.100.1">job hunting.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.1">Getting back to the sites themselves, these sites offer a lot of other things too, not just job listings. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.2">They can help you write a good resume, give you job-hunting advice, provide insight into the companies you may apply to, and they can even proactively match you up with openings based on criteria you (and a prospective employer) set. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.149.3">All of this is helpful functionality that can help in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.150.1">your search.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.1">But these sites aren’t the be-all, end-all of job hunting. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.151.2">There is another way to go that, yes, requires more time and effort on</span><a id="_idIndexMarker886"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.152.1"> your part, but which can sometimes lead to paths you might miss otherwise, and that’s going directly to the websites of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.153.1">various companies.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-226"><a id="_idTextAnchor226"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.154.1">Going directly to company sites</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.1">Most companies in the world have a website, and many of them have job postings listed there. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.155.2">The important thing to </span><a id="_idIndexMarker887"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.1">remember is that there may be job postings on company websites that aren’t on the major job hunt websites, or that may not appear on those sites until later. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.156.2">Therefore, you could potentially get moving on an opportunity before hundreds or thousands of others are even aware of it, which gives you a leg-up on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.157.1">the competition!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.1">So, the first thing to do is to find companies you may want to work for. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.2">This will usually mean some online searches, and usually, that will be for companies in your area or a reasonable commuting distance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.3">Of course, if you’re open to relocation, then your opportunities grow (my first job in IT was in a different US state, which required relocation). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.158.4">You’ll want to do some research, see what the company is all about, and maybe try to get some “insider” information from a site such as Glassdoor to work out if it’s somewhere you might want </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.159.1">to work.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.1">As part of that research, explore their website. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.160.2">You’ll most likely be able to find a link to job postings somewhere, perhaps in their </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.161.1">human resources</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.162.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.163.1">HR</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.1">) section. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.164.2">Failing that, you will probably be able to at</span><a id="_idIndexMarker888"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.1"> least find a phone number or email address that will allow you to contact the company and inquire about openings. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.165.2">But let’s assume you find job </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.166.1">postings online.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.1">At that point, you’ll want to scrutinize the jobs listed and decide which are right for you. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.2">And again, while you shouldn’t apply to everything, don’t be too shy either. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.3">It’s often true that job listings are written by HR folks who don’t have a full or proper grasp of what a position requires. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.4">For example, the job listing may list a whole bunch of technical skills (languages and technologies), but in reality, only a subset is required. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.167.5">It may also be true that even a subset isn’t required, per se – if you can demonstrate your ability to learn, then you may get hired even minus all the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.168.1">listed skills.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.1">The trick – and it’s a difficult one to pull off, to be honest about it – is to get past HR and get to the technical people who will ultimately decide whether to extend you an offer or not. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.2">This is true regardless of whether your initial contact starts directly from a company’s website or through a job search website. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.169.3">If you can manage it, though, you have an opportunity to impress someone, and that’s ultimately </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.170.1">the goal.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.1">So far, we have covered two main strategies for finding a job. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.171.2">However, there is a third that you may have more difficulty </span><a id="_idIndexMarker889"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.172.1">availing yourself of when trying to get your first job in the field, though you shouldn’t dismiss it entirely, and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.173.1">that’s networking.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-227"><a id="_idTextAnchor227"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.174.1">Building a network</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.175.1">Getting into the field can be </span><a id="_idIndexMarker890"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.1">challenging, but once you’re in and have built up some experience, it gets a little easier to get your next job or advance to the next position. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.176.2">To be clear, it never outright gets </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.177.1">easy</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.178.1">, but certainly </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.179.1">easier</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.2">One of the things that makes it easier even beyond experience is the people you meet along the way. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.180.3">There’s a famous saying that it’s not what you know but </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.181.1">who</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.182.1"> you know, and while it may not be as absolute as the saying suggests, there is truth </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.183.1">to it.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.1">As you work in the industry, you’ll meet many people – coworkers, managers, and people you interact with on other teams. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.2">If you cultivate relationships with them, they become assets down the road when and if you are on the hunt for another job (hopefully voluntarily, but you never know). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.184.3">As these people move around to other companies, and you keep in touch with them, they become your “ins” – people you can go to to find out about openings before they become public perhaps, or simply to get your resume into the HR </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.185.1">system faster.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.186.1">This is your </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.187.1">network</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.188.1">, and building that network is called </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.189.1">networking</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.190.2">The good news is no special skills are required: you just </span><a id="_idIndexMarker891"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.1">have to talk to people! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.191.2">I suppose that might be a special skill for some, but it’s one anyone can learn </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.192.1">if so.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.1">Note that this doesn’t mean you need to go to ballgames and their kids’ recitals all the time! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.193.2">I mean, making friends is great too, but this is a </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.194.1">professional</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.1"> network, so what we mean is keeping contact information for people, ensuring it’s valid, and maybe an occasional “Hi, how are you?” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.195.2">touch base email to maintain </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.196.1">the relationship.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.1">Some websites can help you do this too, but one stands above the rest – LinkedIn. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.197.2">I mentioned it before, but it bears some further discussion because it’s more about building your network than it is job hunting – though it turns out to be great for the latter because of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.198.1">the former!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.1">Once you join LinkedIn, you’ll build your profile there, which includes things such as schooling, work experience, and technical skills, but what’s helpful is that you can get others to endorse your skills, thereby showing the world what you know and that it’s not just you claiming that you’re good at these things. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.2">Then, you network with people you know, or companies you’re familiar with. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.3">LinkedIn will suggest people to you based on your profile data as well as your geographic location. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.199.4">You then </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.200.1">connect</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.201.1"> with these people – assuming they reciprocate – and that starts to build a web of people you’re </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.202.1">connected to.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.203.1">One of the most helpful things </span><a id="_idIndexMarker892"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.1">you can do is connect with recruiters. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.2">Once you start building out your LinkedIn profile, you’ll almost certainly start getting connection invitations from recruiters before too long. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.3">These are people whose job it is to get people hired. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.4">It’s not out of the kindness of their hearts: recruiters get paid to do this, usually by employers, but sometimes by employees. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.5">They’ll take your profile (and resume) and work to find job listings that you match up with. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.6">They will sometimes have access to listings that aren’t public yet, which can make them a valuable asset. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.7">Recruiters – at least the good ones – will often help prep you a bit for your interview, giving you tips and pointers specific to the job you’re interviewing for. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.204.8">Afterward, they can get feedback from the company if you aren’t hired, and they can then use it to help you perform better </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.205.1">next time.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.1">Of course, as with most things, not all recruiters are equal, and not all are especially good. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.2">So, you must use your gut when dealing with them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.206.3">Don’t sign anything unless you’re </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.207.1">really</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.1"> comfortable with them! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.2">You don’t want to find yourself tied to one and only one recruiter because you signed an exclusivity contract, for example (thankfully, such tactics aren’t common). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.3">A good recruiter will be like a good car salesman: solid and helpful, but not overly forceful. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.208.4">It’s one of those “you’ll know a bad one when you see </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.209.1">it” situations.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.1">There’s another way you can start building your network even as a newcomer to the field, and it also happens to be free (in most cases), as well as fun and educational! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.210.2">I’m talking about the world of user groups </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.211.1">and meetups.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-228"><a id="_idTextAnchor228"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.212.1">User groups and meetups</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.213.1">Building a network is great in </span><a id="_idIndexMarker893"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.1">theory, but it can be a challenge if you aren’t already in the industry. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.214.2">One way you can overcome this difficulty is to attend user groups and meetups (user groups tend to be viewed as an older term, with meetups being the more common modern version of it, but they mean the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.215.1">same thing).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.1">All around the world, you can find tech professionals, or just enthusiasts, who have meetings to discuss various topics in tech. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.2">You can often find such meetings where a professional developer – sometimes even someone well-known – will come in and give a presentation on a given topic. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.3">Maybe it’s how to use VMs more effectively, or maybe it’s an introduction to React. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.216.4">This can be a great way to learn things of course, but even better is the chance to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.217.1">meet people.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.218.1">These meetings will often be </span><a id="_idIndexMarker894"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.1">accompanied by some pizza and snacks and will almost always have a period before and after when people can just mingle a bit. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.2">If you’re an outgoing person, you can simply walk up to people and introduce yourself beforehand. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.219.3">It’s a little easier after the presentation though since you can start a conversation about what you </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.220.1">just heard.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.1">It’s also an environment where eavesdropping can be very beneficial! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.2">Even if you keep to yourself, just hearing the discussions people are having can yield valuable insights. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.3">You may hear about some new technology taking the world by storm. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.4">Or you may hear interesting ways people are doing things at companies you’ve never heard of. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.5">And you may even catch some crosstalk about how someone is having trouble finding people to fill roles at their company. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.221.6">That could be a nugget of golden information for someone on the hunt for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.222.1">a job!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.223.1">One of the main sites you can use to learn about meetups is, ironically, called Meetup (</span><a href="http://meetup.com"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.224.1">meetup.com</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.225.2">Here, you can search for topics </span><a id="_idIndexMarker895"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.1">of interest to you, search geographically so you aren’t traveling super far, and you can sign up for different groups to get news about upcoming events. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.2">Conversations sometimes happen here – usually after a given event – that can also yield great information. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.226.3">It’s a free site to join, so I highly encourage you to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.227.1">do so.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.1">You should be aware, however, that some meetups might have a (usually very small) cost associated with them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.2">This is understandable when you realize that someone must pay for the food, the space it’s held in, and possibly the speaker on a given night. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.3">While it’s true that there is usually a sponsor (a sponsor whose purpose for sponsoring a meetup is explicitly to look for candidates for positions they’re trying to fill, by the way!), that isn’t always the case. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.228.4">So, don’t be surprised if you’re asked for a few dollars for entry – it will typically be a small amount (I think $5 is the most I’ve ever been asked for in all the hundreds of meetups I’ve attended) and you can think of it as a small investment in your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.229.1">job hunt.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-229"><a id="_idTextAnchor229"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.230.1">Perseverance is key</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.231.1">One thing to keep in mind as you job hunt is that in today’s market, things may not come easy, no matter what path you work to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.232.1">find opportunities.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.233.1">Unfortunately, it is not uncommon to </span><a id="_idIndexMarker896"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.1">hear nothing back when you submit a resume or otherwise contact a potential employer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.234.2">This you can kind of understand – it’s not feasible to get back to everyone who submits a resume just to say no when a company is getting hundreds of them – but it’s something you have to understand going in; otherwise, it can </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.235.1">be disheartening.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.1">Unfortunately, it is not uncommon to even go through the entire interview process and then not hear anything back, not even a “we’ve decided to go with someone else” courtesy call. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.236.2">You’d think people would at least let you know that decision was a no just so you aren’t waiting around, but that’s often not the case (it’s probably </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.237.1">more</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.238.1"> common to </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.239.1">not</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.240.1"> hear </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.241.1">anything honestly).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.1">It’s also not uncommon, unfortunately, to have to apply dozens or maybe even hundreds of times before finding something. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.242.2">Especially as someone with no prior work experience, it’s not an easy road to land that </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.243.1">first position.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.1">That’s why it’s so important to not lose hope, always remain positive, and persevere until the right opportunity finally presents itself and all the hard work pays off. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.2">At the time of writing, the market is a bit on the tough side for new folks to get into the field. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.3">It’s not impossible, but you do have to have patience and keep going at it, even when it seems like you’re getting nowhere. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.244.4">You’ll get there, it just might take some time (then again, you might land the perfect job right out of the gate – you never know, so perseverance is an important trait </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.245.1">to have).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.1">Okay, so, you have some job-hunting sites to go to, you’ve checked out company websites directly, and you’ve built a network up by attending some meetups. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.2">Now, it’s time to apply for a position. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.246.3">That nearly always starts with the same input, and that’s your resume, so let’s talk about </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.247.1">that now.</span></span></p>

<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.263.1">Keep it concise</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.1">: Especially when you have a lot of experience, it’s natural to want to put it all in there, and you can wind up with five to six pages describing everything you’ve ever done. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.2">You have to fight that urge though because it’s almost always counterproductive, and you should limit your resume to one or two pages. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.3">Keep in mind that the goal of a resume is essentially to open the door. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.4">If you do that, you’ll have time to get into all the details during the interview process. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.5">Until then, though, you want to avoid anything that might make people ignore your resume, and being overly long is often cited as one such thing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.6">Resumes that are longer than about two pages will often just be thrown in the trash without even being looked at. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.264.7">It may seem unfair – and it probably </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.265.1">is</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.266.1"> unfair – but it’s the reality, so you have to deal </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.267.1">with it.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.268.1">Clear layout</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.1">: You might think that the more unique your resume the better, so you might be inclined to play with crazy design decisions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.2">And for some job postings, that might be helpful – for example, if you are applying as a graphic designer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.3">But the general rule of thumb is that you should mostly keep it fairly pedestrian. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.4">Use clear, professional-looking, easy-to-read fonts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.5">Use clear, descriptive, and generally short headings to denote the major parts of your resume. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.6">Use bullet points to denote lists. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.269.7">And generally, don’t get too creative with the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.270.1">overall layout.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.271.1">Use keywords</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.1">: In a lot of companies, your resume will start by going through an automated screening process where it will often be eliminated before a human being even looks at it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.2">This is most often done by looking for keywords. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.3">For example, if a vacant position is for a frontend developer with React skills, a resume that doesn’t like React may be eliminated immediately. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.272.4">Therefore, put some effort into using keywords in your resume that match up with the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.273.1">specific</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.274.1"> job opening you’re applying to, or if you aren’t applying to a specific position (maybe you are just putting </span><a id="_idIndexMarker900"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.1">your resume in at a company you especially want to work for without knowing if they have openings or not), then try to use as many keywords as possible that are also accurate. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.275.2">That’s because of the next bullet </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.276.1">point here.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.277.1">No lies or exaggerations</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.1">: Stick to the truth! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.2">You may well get away with a lie or stretching the truth here and there, but if you’re found out, it will destroy any chance you have of landing a position. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.3">It could hurt you even if you do get hired, if in no other way than reputationally. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.4">To be clear, there is a difference between describing things you’ve done in as positive a light as possible and being dishonest about it! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.5">A resume is, in part, a sales job, so it’s okay and encouraged to use language that is as positive as possible. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.278.6">But follow the simple rule that if it’s not true and if you can’t substantiate it if pressed then you shouldn’t put it on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.279.1">your resume.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.280.1">Proofread</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.1">: Check the grammar and spelling in your resume a million times before sending it to anyone and use all tools you can to help with this! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.2">Some people will gloss over minor typos and not hold them against you, but others may outright disqualify you for them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.3">Either way, it’s a bad look: one of the things you want to demonstrate when trying to get hired is attention to detail, and that starts with a resume that is flawless in terms of spelling and grammar. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.281.4">Have others read your resume before you send it anywhere too because a second (or third or fourth…) set of eyes is always a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.282.1">good thing.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.283.1">Avoid irrelevant information</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.1">: It used to be the case that people recommended putting things such as personal hobbies on a resume because it showed that you have a life outside of work and that you may not be, to put it bluntly, a stiff. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.2">Always remember that people like to work with others that are pleasant to be around and that they have things in common with others outside of work because it gives them common ground and touchpoints to be social around. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.3">But a resume isn’t the place for that, so the current thinking is to skip this sort of stuff on a resume. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.284.4">The time for it is during and after an interview if things are and have </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.285.1">gone well.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.286.1">Contact details</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.1">: You’d be surprised how often you get a resume, think it looks pretty good, and then notice that there’s no information about contacting the candidate on it! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.287.2">That’s a sure way to miss out on an opportunity, so ensure these details are present and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.288.1">are current.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.289.1">Use professional language</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.290.1">: You’re applying for a job, hopefully starting a career if all goes well, which </span><a id="_idIndexMarker901"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.1">means you’re communicating in a professional context. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.2">As such, avoid slang or casual phrases in your resume. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.3">Again, there is a time and place for such things later, because your personality does come into play during the interview process, and there comes a time when being a little less formal can be a good thing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.291.4">But your resume isn’t the place to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.292.1">do that.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.293.1">Highlight achievements</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.294.1">: You want to be as specific as possible about the things you’ve done and accomplished, and if you have metrics to support them, then so much the better. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.294.2">If you built a system that saved your employer $10,000 a month, then you’ll want to say that. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.294.3">Of course, if you don’t have any work experience yet then this will become more difficult. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.294.4">But there’s almost always </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.295.1">something</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.1">: did you contribute to an open-source project to get some experience? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.2">Did you build a personal website? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.3">Did you write a game? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.4">Did you work as a stock person at a big-box retail store? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.5">Achievements don’t necessarily have to be directly related to the field you’re entering (though it’s better if they are, of course) – you just have to know how to sell it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.296.6">I’ll talk about this a bit more in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.297.1">next section.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.298.1">Tailor it</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.1">: Finally, whenever possible, customize your resume for the job you’re applying for. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.2">If you know a company is looking for someone to do some cloud development in AWS, then you may want to talk up your experience with cloud providers, even if it’s not AWS. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.3">If a company you’re applying to services mutual funds, then you might want to describe the time you worked as a teller in a bank in a bit more detail because it’s in the same financial industry. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.299.4">Again, don’t be dishonest about anything, but a resume that takes into account where you’re applying to is better than submitting the same generic resume you submit everywhere else (sometimes, you’ll have no choice but to do just that, but any time you can tailor your resume, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.300.1">do so).</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.301.1">One thing you may also consider is engaging the services of a professional resume writing service, such as TopResume (</span><a href="http://topresume.com"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.302.1">topresume.com</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.2">They will – for a price – work with you to produce a top-notch resume. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.303.3">They know all the best practices, they know what companies look for in</span><a id="_idIndexMarker902"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.304.1"> resumes, and they know all the tips and tricks to get your resume to the top </span><a id="_idIndexMarker903"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.305.1">of the pile, or at least lower the odds as much as possible of it being ignored. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.305.2">If you aren’t comfortable with the prospect of putting a good resume together, then such services may be worth considering, But, if you’re comfortable doing it yourself, then you can save a few dollars. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.305.3">Such services typically offer different packages, ranging from a basic review of a resume you created to holding your hand through the entire writing process and even sometimes helping you get your resume submitted. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.305.4">Only you can decide if such a service is right for you, so do some research and see what </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.306.1">you think.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.307.1">Now, let’s talk about what you can do in the situation you’re in, which is that you have little to no real-world working experience in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.308.1">the field.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-232"><a id="_idTextAnchor232"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.309.1">Accentuating what you have</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.310.1">It’s nice when you can describe a dozen high-profile projects that you’ve completed over the last 20 years of professional web </span><a id="_idIndexMarker904"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.1">development, but that’s not where anyone starts. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.311.2">Getting your first job in the field will require </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.312.1">something else.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.313.1">The trick is simple in theory but difficult in practice: you must build up whatever you do have, even if it’s not </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.314.1">directly related.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.315.1">What I mean is what I hinted at earlier. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.315.2">Let’s say you haven’t done any web development yet, at least nothing for pay. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.315.3">But maybe you have been a stock person at a Walmart or Target or another big-box retailer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.315.4">How can you talk up that experience to make </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.316.1">it relevant?</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.1">Well, a stock person has to have some degree of organizational skills. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.2">They must be able to determine the right products to put on the shelves in the proper locations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.3">They might have to be able to put in purchase orders to replenish stocks without over-buying or under-buying. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.317.4">They will need to stock the shelves and do so efficiently, both in terms of time and in terms of how it looks </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.318.1">when finished.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.319.1">In other words, they must pay attention to details, and they must determine a plan of action to effectively reach a set goal. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.319.2">So, say things like that when you describe that </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.320.1">work experience!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.321.1">It’s not dishonest to talk up</span><a id="_idIndexMarker905"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.322.1"> whatever work experience you have. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.322.2">By the same token, if you built a personal website, you could talk that up by describing the technology used, how you went about moving from wireframe to prototype to finished product, and how you implemented SEO effectively to raise your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.323.1">search ranking.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.324.1">Or perhaps you haven’t been out of school very long. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.324.2">If that’s the case, did you do any especially complex assignments? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.324.3">If so, then you can talk about those, taking care to include comments about what you learned and the things you had to overcome to complete </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.325.1">it successfully.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.1">You should focus on the skills you’ve cultivated. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.2">This is generally true whether you have work experience or not, but it becomes more important if you don’t since you won’t have a lot of choice in the matter. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.326.3">Focus on the languages and technologies you’re proficient in or have experience with, no matter the form or extent of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.327.1">that experience.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.1">You should also focus on “soft skills,” things such as teamwork, problem-solving, and adaptability. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.2">And here again, look for places where you can highlight those skills in any form. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.3">If you worked on a team project in school, that’s something to talk about in terms of teamwork. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.4">If you had to take on multiple sections of the store as a stock person when someone else quit, that’s a good example of adaptability and you can talk it up as such. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.328.5">You should also try to relate these skills and experiences to web development wherever you can, though that may not always be possible in a way that doesn’t seem overly contrived, so be careful </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.329.1">with this.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.330.1">The basic point here is that without a lot of demonstratable work experience in the web development field, you have to look for positives in yourself and in your work and life experiences that you can word in such a way that they show things about you that a prospective employer might find enticing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.330.2">At the risk of repeating myself, don’t be dishonest in anything you say because that’s just not worth the potential negative consequences. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.330.3">But building yourself and your abilities up, selling yourself in words, that’s not dishonest – that’s just </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.331.1">good salesmanship!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.1">Naturally, having something that is web development to show is almost always better and will almost always carry more weight than flowery language alone. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.332.2">Fortunately, this is a field where you can gain such experience and have things to show without having professional work experience, and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker906"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.333.1">that’s where things such as repos, portfolios, and samples come into </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.334.1">the picture.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-233"><a id="_idTextAnchor233"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.335.1">Having repos, portfolios, and samples to show</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.336.1">When you go out for your first web developer job, you almost certainly don’t have a long track record to demonstrate your abilities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.336.2">You may have </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.337.1">something</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.1"> to show – you may have built a personal website, or maybe you built a website for your local church gratis. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.338.2">But you don’t have previous jobs to</span><a id="_idIndexMarker907"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.1"> point to and say “Here, this shows what I can do.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.339.2">So, to give yourself the best chance at being hired, you’ll want to build some stuff and make it available for people </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.340.1">to see.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-234"><a id="_idTextAnchor234"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.341.1">Building websites</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.342.1">As I just mentioned, a personal </span><a id="_idIndexMarker908"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.1">website is often the first thing someone creates, and they do it specifically to show their capabilities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.2">The good thing about such a project is it’s all up to you! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.3">You get to decide what it looks like, how it works, what technologies you use to build it, and so on. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.4">However, it is certainly a project you should undertake when you feel up to it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.343.5">To be clear, it doesn’t need to be the best website ever, but it definitely </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.344.1">should</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.345.1"> be the best website </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.346.1">you can build at that point</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.347.1">. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.347.2">You want to be able to point to it and say, “This is what I can do </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.348.1">right now.”</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.349.1">While this is a good start, look for opportunities to build for others too. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.349.2">There are frequently non-profit organizations that are more than happy to have a website built for them for free. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.349.3">This provides a needed service to them while allowing you to learn. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.349.4">But unlike a personal website, now, you must meet the needs of a “client,” which demonstrates a whole other set of abilities that a prospective employer would like to see since they, in effect, will be your client if </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.350.1">you’re hired.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.351.1">For the most part, building a website doesn’t let someone see your code, not in its source form at least, and not the backend code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.351.2">This is where a GitHub repo can come </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.352.1">into play.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-235"><a id="_idTextAnchor235"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.353.1">Building a GitHub repo</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.1">Another thing you should look to do is build up a GitHub repo (or several). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.354.2">There is some debate online about this because some people you will encounter won’t ever look at these repos, but some will – ultimately, if you’re looking for an entry-level position, potential employees may look at </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.355.1">anything</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.356.1"> they can find to gauge </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.357.1">your skills.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.1">If they do choose to look at it, having a GitHub repo allows an interviewer to see how you write code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.358.2">They almost </span><a id="_idIndexMarker909"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.1">certainly won’t be looking at it super-critically because anyone hiring for an entry-level position has to set their expectations realistically. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.359.2">But seeing a repo from someone who has clean code (formatted well), commented well, and appears to be logically structured can provide them insight into your </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.360.1">thought process.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.1">What should you put in your repo? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.2">Well, the simple answer is anything! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.3">When I was hired the first time, I didn’t have a college degree, nor did I have any experience to point to, aside from some side jobs I had done. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.361.4">So, the code I provided for my interviewer to look at included some video games I had written, some small utilities I wrote for myself, and some demos I had written for some old </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.362.1">Bulletin Board Systems</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.363.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.364.1">BBSs</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.365.1">, which came before the internet). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.365.2">This was </span><a id="_idIndexMarker910"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.366.1">an interview at a financial company, so none of this was relevant to what I would be doing on the job. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.366.2">But what was shown to the interviewer was that I was able to write code, and was able to write it in a way they viewed as reasonable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.366.3">They told me point-blank a few months later that all of that helped me get </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.367.1">the job.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.368.1">So, any code you write, so long as you ensure it’s written while following good coding practices, is solid content for your repo. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.368.2">It doesn’t matter if it’s related to the industry you’re applying to – it’s more input into the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.369.1">interview process.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.370.1">But it’s not all about the code, is it? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.370.2">To an extent, it’s also about the artistic side of things, the creative side of things. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.370.3">That’s more what a portfolio is </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.371.1">generally for.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-236"><a id="_idTextAnchor236"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.372.1">Building a portfolio of sample work</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.373.1">In art-related jobs or other creative jobs, it’s not unusual to have a portfolio to present during an interview. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.373.2">For artists, this will </span><a id="_idIndexMarker911"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.374.1">frequently be a book with pages of your drawings, showing what you can do and what you </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.375.1">can create.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.1">Well, web development is part of art, especially when it comes to the frontend! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.2">As such, a portfolio can have some value for you as well. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.3">However, it likely won’t be a physical book like it is for an artist (though I bet many artists today don’t use a physical book anymore either!). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.376.4">It can simply be URLs to show websites </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.377.1">you’ve built.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.378.1">There can be some overlap between a portfolio and a GitHub repo. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.378.2">Your repo may also effectively be your portfolio because one of the capabilities GitHub offers is the ability to host websites. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.378.3">You can take a website in a GitHub repo and make it available as a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.379.1">working website.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.380.1">Regardless, the point here is less about the technical aspect and more about the artistic aspect (though there can certainly be overlap). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.380.2">It’s one thing to see your code and that you wrote it well, but it’s another to look at what’s actually on the screen, what the website is, and see that you</span><a id="_idIndexMarker912"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.1"> followed good design principles, for example. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.2">Or to see that what you created is aesthetically pleasing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.381.3">This is more what a portfolio </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.382.1">is for.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.1">The bottom line in all of this is to look for ways to prove what you can do, to demonstrate your abilities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.2">In working to get your first job, you may have to be a bit creative, and you’ll need to take initiative. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.3">It’s one thing when you have years of real-world work experience and can describe what you’ve done for other employers (though you typically can’t show it since it’s proprietary in most cases), but when you don’t have the benefit of that, you still need to provide as much evidence, for lack of a better word, that someone should take a chance on you. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.383.4">Build stuff, put it online – including the code – and use all of it to prove you’re worth hiring, even without that long </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.384.1">track record!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.1">At this point, you will hopefully have found some job postings, submitted your resume, prepared your GitHub repo, portfolio, and samples, and are – in theory – ready for an interview. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.385.2">Now, let’s look at interviews and what’s involved with getting through </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.386.1">one successfully.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.388.1">There isn’t a </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.389.1">typical</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.390.1"> web developer</span><a id="_idIndexMarker913"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.391.1"> interview, per se – there is a lot of variety across interviews, and lots of ways people conduct them, so no two are the same generally – but there </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.392.1">are</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.393.1"> some common patterns, some things that you’re more likely than not to experience. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.393.2">We can group those things and say they represent what we might refer to as a </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.394.1">typical</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.395.1"> web </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.396.1">development interview.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-238"><a id="_idTextAnchor238"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.397.1">Understanding the structure</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.398.1">Most interviews involve multiple </span><a id="_idIndexMarker914"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.1">rounds of activity. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.2">These rounds may be conducted by one person or by many, individually or in a group setting. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.399.3">They may occur in one day or be spread across </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.400.1">several days.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.401.1">The initial review round</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.402.1">In the first round, it’s more likely than not that </span><a id="_idIndexMarker915"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.403.1">you will encounter a review of your resume, where you’ll be asked questions about previous projects and experience. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.403.2">These questions will typically be probing to ensure that what’s listed on your resume is accurate (for example, by asking you to describe how a specific technology listed for a given project was used) and to try to judge how deeply you know these topics. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.403.3">You may get questions such as “Oh, I see you used MongoDB on this project, can you tell me about the data structure you designed?” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.403.4">or maybe “How did you implement sharding in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.404.1">that database?”</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.1">At this point, answer the questions directly and try not to editorialize too much. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.2">You may find that your nerves start kicking in and you start rambling, or if not because of nerves, then because you think a longer answer must necessarily be better. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.405.3">Try to avoid that, but also avoid being </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.406.1">too</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.407.1"> short. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.407.2">You don’t want to be seen as babbling on, but you also don’t want to be seen as either not knowing what you claim to know, or not knowing it in depth (unless you specifically say “Yes, I used MongoDB, but I didn’t get into it too deeply, so I can’t claim to be an expert in it,” which is a reasonable answer if it’s </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.408.1">the truth).</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.409.1">The technical round</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.410.1">After this round, you’re likely to be asked some technical questions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.410.2">Here, I’m talking about questions along the lines of “What</span><a id="_idIndexMarker916"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.411.1"> function can you use to get a reference to a DOM node in JavaScript if you know the element’s ID?” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.411.2">Direct, knowledge-testing questions are what these are. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.411.3">These will, hopefully, be relevant to the job you’re applying for, though that, unfortunately, is </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.412.1">not guaranteed.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.413.1">My advice for handling these types of questions is to answer to the best of your ability, but if you simply don’t know something, then say so. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.413.2">Try to soften the blow as best you can though. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.413.3">For the previous question, you might say something like, “I’m sorry, that’s something I’ve not encountered before, but given a few minutes to research online, I know I could find that answer because I know that a DOM node is the JavaScript representation of an HTML element in the Document Object Model, and I’ve worked with JavaScript, so it should just be a matter of some quick research.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.413.4">That tells the interviewer that you do have the basic knowledge they’re looking for, but you may have just blanked on the particular function, or it is something you’ve never used, and no one is expected to know every </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.414.1">last detail.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.415.1">During this round, you may be asked to code on a whiteboard (which is something almost everyone hates!). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.415.2">The interviewer may ask, for example, for you to write a bubble sort algorithm on the board in Python. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.415.3">Rest assured that most interviewers do not expect perfection here! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.415.4">Even if your solution is close, that will usually be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.416.1">good enough.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.417.1">One of the best things you </span><a id="_idIndexMarker917"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.1">can do here is to “think out loud” as you work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.2">Verbalize the internal dialogue going on in your head as you work through the problem. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.3">This does two things. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.4">First, it lets the interviewer have an insight into your thought process, which is good for you because even if your solution doesn’t turn out right, they can hear that you were at least on the right track, and you’ll still get points even for a failed attempt. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.418.5">Second, it will help calm your nerves since speaking out loud in such a situation tends to allow your body to release some of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.419.1">the stress.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.420.1">And don’t be afraid to correct yourself either! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.420.2">If you start down a wrong path and realize it, saying something like “Oh wait, that won’t work because </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.421.1">X</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.422.1">; I need to do </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.423.1">Y</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.424.1"> instead” is a great thing </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.425.1">to hear.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.426.1">The getting-to-know-you round</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.427.1">Most interviews tend to have a more relaxed round after this where it becomes a bit more personal, and a bit more freeform in</span><a id="_idIndexMarker918"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.428.1"> nature. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.428.2">Here, you’re being evaluated for cultural fit and, frankly, just to see if you’re someone that people will enjoy interacting with. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.428.3">Here, the goal is simply to be friendly, open, and honest. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.428.4">However, try not to be </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.429.1">too</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.430.1"> open. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.430.2">You don’t need to reveal all your inner secrets at this point, and you don’t need to talk about every unusual hobby you may have. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.430.3">You can’t prepare for this round in any concrete way other than practicing being a personable individual as best </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.431.1">you can.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.432.1">This is also the round where you generally get a chance to ask some questions about the job and the company. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.432.2">I’ll talk about this in the </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.433.1">Handling common interview questions</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.434.1"> section, but for now, it’s enough to say that you should try and come prepared with a small handful of questions to ask. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.434.2">An especially good one is simply “Tell me a bit about the culture here; what it’s like to work here?” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.434.3">or something similar. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.434.4">It shows interest, will give the other person a chance</span><a id="_idIndexMarker919"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.435.1"> to talk a bit to take a little pressure off you, and can net you some valuable insight into what accepting an offer at that company might mean for you day </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.436.1">to day.</span></span></p>
<h3><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.437.1">The assignment round</span></h3>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.438.1">Another round that you may encounter is a take-home assignment or, sometimes, an on-site assignment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.438.2">In either</span><a id="_idIndexMarker920"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.439.1"> case, it’s when you’ll be asked to build something, some small project to demonstrate your abilities. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.439.2">These aren’t quite as common as the other rounds I’ve described, but some companies do them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.439.3">You’ll usually be given an assignment that is job-relevant, and you’ll then be given access to a workstation (or you may be allowed to use your own). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.439.4">In most cases, you’ll have more or less free reign to decide what tools you use and how you build the assignment (you may be given some general parameters, such as “We want you to build this with React”). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.439.5">In most cases, you won’t be monitored as you work, but some companies may have someone watching over </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.440.1">your shoulder.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.1">There are no real tricks here – you simply have to do the best you can! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.2">Choose the tools and technologies you are most comfortable with and focus on writing good, clean code that you can present well – most of the time, that’s what will happen, and you’ll have to walk through your results with the interviewer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.441.3">They may ask questions about why you did things the way you did, so make sure you can justify </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.442.1">every decision.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.443.1">I must caution you about these sorts of assignments, though: don’t let anyone take advantage of you! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.443.2">Your time is valuable, and some companies will take advantage of that by giving you unreasonable assignments that will take hours to do. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.443.3">Some especially unscrupulous companies may even try to get free work out of you by giving you an assignment that is something they need to get done! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.443.4">You have to use your gut here and decide what’s reasonable and what isn’t. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.443.5">My general rule of thumb is that if you realistically believe you can do the assignment in an hour or less, then that’s probably reasonable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.443.6">If you think it’ll take longer, then you may want to say “I’m sorry, but I think that assignment will take me an inordinate amount of time to accomplish, so I’m not comfortable with it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.443.7">Is there something else you can ask of me that won’t take quite </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.444.1">as long?”</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.445.1">Some companies may also be willing to pay you for the time spent on the assignment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.445.2">That’s not common and I’d say you probably shouldn’t expect it, but it’s nice when it happens. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.445.3">In such cases, your tolerance for how long it’ll take may be greater. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.445.4">I would also say that you shouldn’t take on a longer assignment unless you feel like the rest of the interview has gone well and you’re excited about the opportunity the company presents. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.445.5">There’s probably no sense in spending 6 hours coding a login page if it’s a company you were kind of half-hearted about in the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.446.1">first place.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.447.1">Now that you have some idea </span><a id="_idIndexMarker921"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.448.1">of what an interview might look like, let’s talk about some general things you can do to prepare for a coding-centric interview, aside from the advice I gave in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.449.1">this section.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-239"><a id="_idTextAnchor239"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.450.1">Preparing for coding interviews</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.451.1">A coding interview, or a technical interview generally, can be a very stressful event. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.451.2">It largely comes down, in the simplest terms, to </span><a id="_idIndexMarker922"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.1">whether you know the stuff, and proving that you do. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.2">When I interview people, that’s the primary thing I’m looking for because whether they have the skills required for the position, what I’m trying to fill is what matters most. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.452.3">It’s not </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.453.1">all</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.454.1"> that matters, not by a long shot, but it’s the first thing on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.455.1">the list.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.456.1">One thing that </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.457.1">doesn’t</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.458.1"> matter, paradoxically, is that a candidate has every answer right on the tip of their tongue. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.458.2">First, we work in a field where that’s a practical impossibility. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.458.3">And second, it’s a field where researching and using reference material is a must. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.458.4">Yes, there are some things I expect that every candidate knows off the top of their head. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.458.5">For example, if I’m trying to hire a frontend developer, I certainly would expect that they can tell me something about the CSS box model. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.458.6">If I’m hiring a Java developer, I’d expect they can tell me what string interning is </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.459.1">all about.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.460.1">But what I’m </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.461.1">not</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.462.1"> looking for is, for example, if they can tell me every method available on the JavaScript string object or if they know the arguments required for a specific array method. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.462.2">These are things that I expect people to look up when needed (you tend to remember only what you’re using the most and the most recently, so people will tend to know some of this sort of stuff, but never all of it). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.462.3">So, as a candidate, you can relax a little bit in that interviewers aren’t going to expect you to know </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.463.1">everything cold.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.464.1">But at the same time, it’s important that you know as much as possible and be able to demonstrate </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.465.1">your abilities.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.466.1">One of the ways interviewers often try and gauge this is with websites that present coding challenges for you to solve. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.466.2">Two of the most famous are HackerRank (</span><a href="http://hackerrank.com"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.467.1">hackerrank.com</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.468.1">) and LeetCode (</span><a href="http://leetcode.com"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.469.1">leetcode.com</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.470.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.470.2">You may be asked to do some of these challenges during an interview. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.470.3">They usually come in the form of tasks that require you to write some small piece of code, and then the platform confirms if it functions correctly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.470.4">In theory, it doesn’t matter how you write the code per se – what matters is that it has the specified result, so they aren’t generally looking for specific solutions, just </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.471.1">working</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.472.1"> solutions (they can, however – and unfortunately – be a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.473.1">bit finicky).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.474.1">The good news is that these sites are available to you outside of interviews, and they are great ways to not only prepare for an interview that will use them, but also for interviews that won’t, and just</span><a id="_idIndexMarker923"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.475.1"> generally to learn about writing code. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.475.2">I most definitely encourage you to use these sites. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.475.3">Work through the challenges and get familiar with how they work and what they look for in your solution. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.475.4">That way, if you are confronted with them in an interview, it won’t be your first time </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.476.1">encountering them.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.477.1">More generally, studying </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.478.1">data structure and algorithms</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.479.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.480.1">DS&amp;A</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.481.1">)  is an important step. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.481.2">If you’ve never heard these terms</span><a id="_idIndexMarker924"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.482.1"> before, let </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.483.1">me explain.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.484.1">In simplest terms, </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.485.1">data structures</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.486.1"> are standard ways of storing data. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.486.2">For example, an array is a data structure – one that is </span><a id="_idIndexMarker925"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.487.1">built into almost every programming language. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.487.2">You can use the basic capabilities of a language and build more advanced structures – things such as lists (a more robust form of array in essence), stacks (also like an array, but where elements can only go in or come out in well-defined specific ways,) and maps (which equate a key to a value, allowing you to look up values by their keys). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.487.3">These are some of the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.488.1">simplest examples.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.489.1">And the term </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.490.1">algorithms</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.491.1"> is just a complex way of saying a set of programming instructions to perform a specific task. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.491.2">For </span><a id="_idIndexMarker926"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.492.1">example, there are many ways you can sort data and many different algorithms that you can choose from. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.492.2">Some will work better if your data is already mostly in order, others might slow down the more data there is to sort, and still others will use more CPU power to get the job done regardless. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.492.3">Knowing these different algorithms and their trade-offs is something you may be expected to know during an interview and on </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.493.1">the job.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.494.1">But during an interview specifically, you might be asked to implement a two-way linked list. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.494.2">However, it’s more important to know what that is and how and when to apply it than it is to know how to implement it yourself – in most cases on the job, you wouldn’t be implementing it yourself, you would use a ready-made version. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.494.3">While it’s valuable to know how to invert a binary tree because that could be something you’re asked to do on a whiteboard, it’s even more valuable to know what a binary tree is and why we use them and be able to explain that because that’s what you’ll need on the job. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.494.4">Sites such as HackerRank and LeetCode are largely based on requiring you to implement such DS&amp;A solutions, so studying</span><a id="_idIndexMarker927"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.495.1"> them more generally will help you handle those sites and tests </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.496.1">on them.</span></span></p>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-240"><a id="_idTextAnchor240"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.510.1">Dealing with the stress</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.511.1">I have mentioned a few times that interviews can be stressful situations. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.511.2">Most people aren’t especially comfortable being what </span><a id="_idIndexMarker928"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.512.1">may feel like being interrogated.  </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.512.2">There isn’t any magic bullet solution that will make most interviews easy, but knowing what to expect going in and having some coping strategies is helpful. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.512.3">Let’s look at some of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.513.1">them now:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.514.1">Preparation</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.515.1">: Obviously, studying and knowing your stuff is a key thing to do. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.515.2">Take some time to review the basics – it’s easy to get flummoxed when you’re asked a question that you know is basic and easy, but you blank on it, and this happens to everyone! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.515.3">Also, be sure to bone up on any specific technologies mentioned in the job description, even if you don’t have much (or any) experience with them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.515.4">I can tell you that for my first interview, I was asked questions about Visual FoxPro. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.515.5">I had never used that before, but because it was listed in the job description, I bought a book about it and read it before the interview. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.515.6">As a result, I was able to answer some questions that the interviewer later told me no one </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.516.1">else could.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.517.1">Do mock interviews</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.518.1">: If you have friends or family willing to do so, let them play interviewer and run you</span><a id="_idIndexMarker929"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.519.1"> through the wringer! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.519.2">Some websites can help you do mock interviews, including Pramp (</span><a href="http://pramp.com"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.520.1">pramp.com</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.521.1">) </span><a href="http://interviewing.io"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.522.1">interviewing.io</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.1"> (that’s both the site name and the URL!), and even HackerRank and LeetCode offer some of this functionality. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.523.2">These might be better choices than your friends or family since you may be a bit too comfortable </span><a id="_idIndexMarker930"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.524.1">with friends and family, and the goal here is to </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.525.1">not</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.526.1"> be comfortable in a more controlled setting than a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.527.1">real interview.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.528.1">Mindfulness techniques</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.529.1">: Breathing exercises or meditation before the interview can help calm your nerves and get you into a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.530.1">good headspace.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.531.1">Shifting your perspective</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.532.1">: Remember that an interview is a two-way street. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.532.2">You’re also assessing if the company is a good fit for you. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.532.3">This can emotionally give you a small sense of power, which can lead to not </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.533.1">feeling overwhelmed.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.534.1">Stay positive</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.535.1">: No matter how you think the interview is going, focus on learning from the experience right from the start. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.535.2">If you’re sitting there thinking “I’m bombing this!” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.535.3">then take a moment to ask yourself exactly what’s going wrong. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.535.4">Obviously, in the middle of an interview, you’re probably not going to be able to sit there with a blank stare on your face while you consider the question! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.535.5">But you can kind of subconsciously process the question, and whether that allows you to make adjustments on the fly or simply consider what you’ll do better next time, it can reframe what’s happening </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.536.1">more positively.</span></span></li>
<li><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.537.1">Post-interview analysis</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.538.1">: Regardless of the outcome, be sure to reflect on what went well and what could be improved for next time when you’re done. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.538.2">This is an extension of the previous point, but it’s more focused on lessons learned and improving, not on helping you during </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.539.1">the interview.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.540.1">The next thing to consider is the impression you give to the interviewer, and what you can do to ensure it’s a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.541.1">positive one.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-241"><a id="_idTextAnchor241"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.542.1">Presenting the best you</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.543.1">As you work your way through the interview process, in whatever form it takes, always remember to present yourself both </span><a id="_idIndexMarker931"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.544.1">professionally and friendly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.544.2">Smile, make eye contact, and stay in the moment. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.544.3">Don’t let anything else into your mind beyond that interview because, in that moment, it’s all </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.545.1">that matters.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.546.1">Make sure you dress for success too. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.546.2">Even if you know that the environment of the company is casual dress, wear professional attire for the interview (I would suggest doing this even if you’re explicitly told you can dress casually, though that is perhaps debatable). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.546.3">We’re not talking about a tuxedo here, or even a suit and tie or an expensive pantsuit. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.546.4">Slacks and a collared shirt will be acceptable for both women and men in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.547.1">most environments.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.1">Ensure your grooming is impeccable as well. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.2">It’s all about presenting a picture of yourself that is positive to most people. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.3">You can never be sure how someone will react to you, but you can’t control that – you can only control yourself. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.548.4">Ensuring you don’t look slovenly is something you </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.549.1">can control.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.550.1">This will make you come across as someone who is professional and focused and who has good attention to detail thinking, which is exactly what you want to get across when you’re trying for a position where those things matter, as they do in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.551.1">web development.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.1">But no matter how well-prepared you are, it’s still entirely possible that you’ll run into a bad interviewer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.552.2">Given that, let’s talk about what you might be able to do if you find yourself in that </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.553.1">unenviable position.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-242"><a id="_idTextAnchor242"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.554.1">Protecting yourself</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.555.1">At the end of the day, being interviewed is difficult. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.555.2">But so too is conducting interviews. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.555.3">It may not seem like it should be, but it is. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.555.4">Asking good questions is difficult. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.555.5">Judging people is difficult. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.555.6">Ensuring fairness</span><a id="_idIndexMarker932"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.556.1"> is difficult. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.556.2">It’s a skill all of its own that takes time to cultivate and develop, and unfortunately, before that happens, many people are not very good at it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.556.3">Given that, as a candidate, you should take steps to protect yourself as best as </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.557.1">you can.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.558.1">For example, you may sometimes run into an interviewer who doesn’t want to be there. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.558.2">Maybe they have a ton of work to do themselves and feel like they don’t have the time to do an interview. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.558.3">They may be distracted, constantly checking their phone, for example. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.558.4">As a result, they may rush through the interview and wind up not giving you a fair shake. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.558.5">There frankly isn’t a whole lot you can do in such a situation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.558.6">Your best bet is to remain friendly and try to provide succinct but still meaningful answers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.558.7">Be careful not to meander since that will likely just exacerbate the situation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.558.8">If, on the other hand, they sense that you’re trying to be respectful of their time, their demeanor </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.559.1">may change.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.560.1">Or you may run into someone who doesn’t know how to construct good questions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.560.2">They may ask you very open-ended questions (which sometimes is done on purpose, but often not), or things that are highly opinion-based (which, again, can be valid questions in some cases). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.560.3">They may ask questions that are worded confusingly, or that you judge to have no real valid answer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.560.4">The best thing you can probably do in such cases is ask for clarification (politely and </span><a id="_idIndexMarker933"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.561.1">respectfully, of course). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.561.2">Make sure you understand what’s being asked as best you can by confirming your understanding. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.561.3">“Okay, so I think what you’re asking me is how does a closure in JavaScript work, is that right?” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.561.4">is a good question to ask to make sure you’re understanding what’s </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.562.1">being asked.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.563.1">You may occasionally run into an interviewer who is more interested in impressing you with what they know, or otherwise being intimidating. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.563.2">There’s no easy answer to dealing with this, but it generally comes down to believing in yourself and having confidence. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.563.3">Be sure to maintain good eye contact and a steady posture because body language most definitely matters during an interview. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.563.4">If you sense that they’re trying to impress you with their knowledge, go ahead and let them use it as a learning opportunity! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.563.5">They may very well have a lot they could teach you, so you might as well pay attention and remain positive about the situation by viewing it as a chance to grow </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.564.1">your knowledge.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.565.1">Being asked irrelevant questions is something else that often happens with bad interviewers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.565.2">To them, of course, the questions </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.566.1">are</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.567.1"> relevant, but probably not in a way that makes much sense. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.567.2">To handle these, ask for clarification first, because maybe the questions </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.568.1">are</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.569.1"> relevant in a way you just haven’t seen. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.569.2">If not, do your best to steer the conversation back to your skills and abilities relevant to the role. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.569.3">And always remember that if a question strikes you as offensive or overly personal, you have every right to simply refuse to answer it. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.569.4">How best to do that is tricky, but I would go with something like “I’m sorry but I’m not comfortable answering that question” and leave it </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.570.1">at that.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.571.1">Beyond the stress, potentially poor interviewers, and needing to know your technical material, there are some fairly common questions that you may encounter, and having a game plan for answering them going in is a good idea, so let’s tackle some of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.572.1">those now.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.574.1">Aside from the technical angle, some non-technical questions tend to be asked during interviews, and at least some of them are pretty common. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.574.2">They may be asked in varying ways, but they kind of boil down to the same basic question regardless. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.574.3">Here, I’ll attempt to generalize them as </span><a id="_idIndexMarker934"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.575.1">much as possible and talk about how you might want to answer them (with an underlying point being that you always want to answer them </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.576.1">truthfully</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.577.1">, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.578.1">of course).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.579.1">Note that this is in no way meant to be an exhaustive list. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.579.2">What I’ve done is, through a bit of research, coupled with my personal experience on both sides of the table, come up with what are probably the 10 most popular such questions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.579.3">Naturally, you must be ready for others, or indeed none of them! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.579.4">It’s not a given that you’ll be asked such questions during an interview, and it’s certainly not a given it’ll be these specific questions. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.579.5">But they are common enough that I think they’re worth calling out, and if nothing else, they should get you to start thinking about such questions, which should help prepare you for any others that may </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.580.1">come up.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-244"><a id="_idTextAnchor244"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.581.1">Tell me about yourself</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.582.1">This is a completely open-ended question that you could go many ways with. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.582.2">But primarily, you should focus on your professional journey, highlighting relevant experiences and achievements. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.582.3">When you don’t have much (or any) professional experience yet, highlight whatever you can. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.582.4">For example, if you’re very into contributing to open source projects, then certainly mention that. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.582.5">If you love writing games, talk about that </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.583.1">a bit.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.584.1">In general, try to convey that you are enthusiastic about the field, technology, and learning. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.584.2">You can get into your personal life a little bit but try to relate it to professional life. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.584.3">There’s nothing wrong per se with talking about your hobbies – unless they might be considered inappropriate of course – but that’s probably not what the interviewer is interested in hearing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.584.4">They want to hear about how you’re the type of person who will do well in the role you’re interviewing for, so focus on that in any way </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.585.1">you can.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-245"><a id="_idTextAnchor245"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.586.1">Why do you want to work here?</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.587.1">This can be looked at as a bit of a trick question because the obvious answer for all of us is “Because I need to earn money and you’ve got an opening!” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.587.2">But in reality, this is an opportunity to demonstrate that this isn’t just another job interview for you (even if it is). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.587.3">To do that, show that you’ve researched the company a bit. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.587.4">Talk about how the company’s mission aligns with your values and how you’d love to be a part of making that mission </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.588.1">a success.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.589.1">As I’ve said several times, don’t be dishonest here. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.589.2">If your values don’t align with those of the company, you probably shouldn’t be applying there in the first place. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.589.3">But if the mission of the company doesn’t exactly excite you, it’s still possible to say something like “I like solving problems and building complex things, and the mission of this company will give me a</span><a id="_idIndexMarker935"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.590.1"> chance to exercise those skills.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.590.2">But if you haven’t researched the company at all, then you couldn’t say something </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.591.1">like that.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-246"><a id="_idTextAnchor246"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.592.1">What are your greatest strengths?</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.593.1">The key to answering this question well is to choose strengths that are relevant to the role you’re applying for and be able to give examples to demonstrate </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.594.1">those strengths.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.595.1">For example, for a web developer position, you should think about strengths that demonstrate your ability to solve problems, your ability to take rough designs and translate them to finished products, your ability to be creative, and your ability to learn new things. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.595.2">This could be done by, for example, telling a story about a project you worked on where you had to pick up new skills as you designed and built a personal website, or programmed </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.596.1">a game.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.597.1">If you’ve done your research and know that the company uses cloud providers, you might want to put additional focus on the time you experimented with Microsoft Azure, even if what you built wasn’t anything special. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.597.2">Then, take this specific example and say something more generic, such as the fact that you had never worked with Azure before, so you had to learn as you went, and along the way, you had to solve how to set up authentication, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.598.1">for example.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-247"><a id="_idTextAnchor247"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.599.1">What is your greatest weakness?</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.600.1">This is a question that people typically like to try and answer in a “tricky” way. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.600.2">For example, you might say that sometimes, you get so engrossed in what you’re doing that you work longer hours than you should because that makes it seem like you’re dedicated. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.600.3">In other words, you might try to turn a negative into a positive. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.600.4">To be sure, that </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.601.1">can</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.602.1"> work if done properly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.602.2">However, there’s a great chance that you’ll come across as insincere or cagey, and that’s something you want to avoid at all costs during </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.603.1">an interview.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.604.1">Instead, since not a single one of us is perfect, try to find a real weakness in yourself and present it honestly. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.604.2">Granted, you probably don’t want to choose a </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.605.1">big</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.606.1"> one (“I like to take office supplies home every chance I get!” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.606.2">probably isn’t in your best interest, for example). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.606.3">You probably don’t want to say that you frequently enjoy crashing your car into coffee shops! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.606.4">But it’s not usually hard to find something that isn’t monstrous that is a weakness. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.606.5">You might say something like “I sometimes find myself temporarily panicking if I don’t know something immediately,” which is something we </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.607.1">all experience.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.608.1">Then – and this is </span><a id="_idIndexMarker936"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.609.1">the key – talk about how you’re working to improve yourself in that area. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.609.2">Maybe you might say “To try and deal with that panic, I’ve been actively seeking out situations where I’ll be forced to deal with new technologies so that I can work to overcome it.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.609.3">It shows that you’re honest, introspective, and willing to make corrections </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.610.1">as needed.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-248"><a id="_idTextAnchor248"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.611.1">Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.612.1">This is another one of those open-ended questions where there are not any right or wrong answers. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.612.2">The trick is to simply </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.613.1">have</span></em> <span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.614.1">an answer.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.615.1">You probably shouldn’t be overly grandiose with your answer. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.615.2">It’s perfectly fine if, in your mind, your answer would be “I want to be the CEO!” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.615.3">but that’s probably not the best answer </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.616.1">to give.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.617.1">First, it’ll probably not be seen as realistic – a trait that most people generally tend to value in people who work for them – and might even get you laughed at (if only silently). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.617.2">It’s good to have big goals, but there are a lot of steps between that goal and where you are now, and people want to see that you aren’t looking too far over the horizon and </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.618.1">being unrealistic.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.619.1">Second, that answer may imply that you’ll be looking to move up or even out of the company as quickly as possible in the interest of your career goals. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.619.2">Look at it from their perspective: why put in all the time and effort to hire you, train you, get you up to speed and ready to be productive in the position they need filling, just to see you move on to another position (whether to another company or just to another position in the same company) at the first chance you get? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.619.3">From their perspective, that’s a lot of wasted time and effort at that point, depending on how long you were in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.620.1">that role.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.621.1">So, you want to strike a balance between being ambitious and not being so ambitious that they think you won’t want to do the job they’re</span><a id="_idIndexMarker937"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.622.1"> hiring for, and they’ll lose you before they get a decent </span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.623.1">return on investment</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.624.1"> (</span><strong class="bold"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.625.1">ROI</span></strong><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.626.1">). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.626.2">Because remember, you very much </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.627.1">are</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.628.1"> an investment from </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.629.1">their perspective!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.630.1">You should also try to align your career goals with opportunities at the company, and this again comes from research. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.630.2">It’s okay to say something like “In 5 years, I hope to be a team lead” because it shows you have ambition but that those ambitions will likely keep you there for a while, and it’s not an unrealistic goal either. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.630.3">They may appreciate such a goal because it probably indicates you’re going to work hard and produce good results in the interests of your </span><a id="_idIndexMarker938"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.631.1">career advancement, but that effort will be aiding them all along. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.631.2">Demonstrating a win-win situation if you’re hired is a good goal to keep </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.632.1">in mind!</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-249"><a id="_idTextAnchor249"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.633.1">Why should we hire you?</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.634.1">For this type of question, you’ll want to explain how you can contribute to what the company does, and how your skills and experiences line up with the job requirements. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.634.2">Obviously, for a web development position, spelling out how you have learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and how you can put them to work building real websites, </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.635.1">is key.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.636.1">You’ll also want to demonstrate enthusiasm for the position, though without going overboard to the point of it sounding forced. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.636.2">Something along the lines of “I enjoy the challenges inherent in web development and I believe my skills will allow me to do that effectively for you” might be a good </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.637.1">starting point.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-250"><a id="_idTextAnchor250"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.638.1">Describe a challenge you faced and how you overcame it</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.639.1">This is one of the easier questions to answer because, let’s face it, we’ve all had challenges to overcome – and hopefully we’ve all overcome them! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.639.2">Here, we’re talking about challenges that would be work-related, whether that was on the job </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.640.1">or not.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.641.1">Be sure to use specific examples and to focus on your problem-solving approach and the eventual outcome. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.641.2">The challenges you discuss – one or two will suffice – could be big or small, so long as they demonstrate how you dealt with them effectively. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.641.3">Maybe you could talk about the time you spent hours fighting with some CSS to get a website’s layout just right. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.641.4">Or it could be the time your PC was acting weird, and you had to do a bunch of research and registry editing to get the problem resolved. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.641.5">Anything that shows you can tackle problems, fight through them, research, learn, and reason is </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.642.1">what’s important.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.643.1">Note that you usually wouldn’t want to discuss any sort of personal challenges here. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.643.2">However, as someone looking for an entry-level position, this may be all you have. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.643.3">Maybe your car broke down and you had to deal with that. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.643.4">Or perhaps there was a bad rainstorm and your house’s roof was leaking and you had to put together a makeshift patch to keep your house from flooding. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.643.5">So long as you highlight how you overcame the challenges and how you approached them, as well as your thought process for dealing with them, they can be okay as an answer if it’s all </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.644.1">you have.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-251"><a id="_idTextAnchor251"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.645.1">How do you handle stress or pressure?</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.646.1">This question goes along hand-in-hand with the previous one because when we’re facing technical challenges, we’re also facing some level of stress and pressure. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.646.2">How you handle that is something a prospective employer will want </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.647.1">to know.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.648.1">The way to answer this is just like the last question: provide specific examples of tough situations and explain how and why they made you feel tense. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.648.2">Then, explain any coping mechanisms you </span><a id="_idIndexMarker939"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.649.1">utilized to deal with them. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.649.2">Maybe you regularly use various breathing exercises. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.649.3">Or your answer could be that you sought assistance from someone with more knowledge of the topic at hand than you had. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.649.4">Anything that demonstrates that you know how to handle stress and won’t wilt under pressure is what someone is looking </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.650.1">for here.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.651.1">You also might want to mention any proactive stress management techniques you use, and this is an area where getting a little bit personal is probably more acceptable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.651.2">For example, if you like to fish because it’s relaxing, that’s okay to mention. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.651.3">However, remember that primarily, the goal is to show what you’ll be able to do and handle on the job, so trying to relate your answer to a work environment will </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.652.1">be helpful.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-252"><a id="_idTextAnchor252"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.653.1">What are your salary expectations?</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.654.1">This is always a difficult question and leads to the much larger topic of negotiations, which is something that many people aren’t comfortable with. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.654.2">To help answer this question, be sure to research industry standards and norms before getting to the interview so that you have realistic expectations (I covered this in the first few chapters, but this is data that changes all the time, so you’ll want to research a bit right before </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.655.1">the interview).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.656.1">You’ll want to be honest about what you’re looking for but be open to some degree of negotiating. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.656.2">There is usually some flexibility from the hiring side when it comes to salary, but it will depend on a lot of factors, some of which you’ll have no control over. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.656.3">So, avoid saying something like ‘Well, I know web developers make </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.657.1">X</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.658.1">, so this is what I want.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.658.2">Instead, say something like “Well, based on my research, a range of </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.659.1">X</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.660.1"> to </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.661.1">Y</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.662.1"> seems to be the norm, so I’m looking for something in that range.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.662.2">Just be sure that the low end of that range is a number you’ll be happy with because it’s natural for the hirer to want to be closer to that end of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.663.1">the range.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.664.1">At the end of the day, it’s up to you whether to accept any offer, so you can be as firm with this answer or as flexible with it as you want. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.664.2">If you price yourself way out of their comfort zone, then that’s a position you weren’t going to get anyway to be blunt, so while some flexibility is good, don’t allow yourself to be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.665.1">lowballed either.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-253"><a id="_idTextAnchor253"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.666.1">Do you have any questions for us?</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.667.1">Finally, we come to</span><a id="_idIndexMarker940"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.668.1"> a question that will normally be the last one asked in most interviews, and it’s one you should prepare for with research. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.668.2">You’ll want to have two to three good questions queued up. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.668.3">If you don’t have any questions at all, then it tends to imply a lack of interest or engagement, something you don’t want to ever show in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.669.1">an interview.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.670.1">You can ask about things such as team structure, what the company culture is like, what a typical workday would be like for your position, or about specific projects if your research turned up any. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.670.2">You can ask about work/life balance (which is coming up next!) and what’s on the horizon for the company in terms of projects that you might be </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.671.1">involved with.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.672.1">Don’t go overboard, though! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.672.2">If you ask too many questions, or questions that require long, in-depth answers, then you run the risk of being seen as not respectful of the interviewer’s time. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.672.3">So, two to three questions is a good rule of thumb, assuming they can all be answered in a minute or two. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.672.4">And it’s okay to ask follow-up questions based on the answers, but again, remember to not start taking up too much of the </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.673.1">interviewer’s time.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.674.1">So, let’s say that you’ve landed your first web developer job through a lot of hard work and preparation. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.674.2">Congratulations! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.674.3">There’s one last thing I want to discuss, and that’s the idea of </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.675.1">work/life balance.</span></span></p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-254"><a id="_idTextAnchor254"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.676.1">Remembering that it’s not all about work</span></h1>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.677.1">This chapter is focused on getting you a job, getting you to attain gainful employment in the web development field. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.677.2">But as Homer Simpson said, “All work and no play make Homer something something.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.677.3">That, of course, was a humorous reference to the famous movie The Shining, where the main character goes crazy, ostensibly from focusing too much on work (well, it may have had something to do with the spirits living in the inn he was at too, but we’ll put that part aside for our </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.678.1">purposes here!).</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.679.1">So, while this section isn’t about landing your first job, I believe it’s about something that is an important enough consideration that you should have it in the back of your mind all along, even as you’re on</span><a id="_idIndexMarker941"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.680.1"> the hunt for that first job: </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.681.1">work/life balance.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.682.1">Burnout can be a big problem in any “knowledge worker” industry, including IT (probably in any industry generally, but it seems to be a bigger problem for knowledge workers). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.682.2">This is especially true when you love solving problems and creating things because you’ll work longer and harder than you probably should in service of those goals just because you get so wrapped up in what you’re doing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.682.3">You’ll hear about “the zone” sometimes, or “the flow,” and it’s a real thing. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.682.4">It takes time to build up mental models of what you’re working on, and any interruption sets you back, but it also means that once you’re in that flow state, you tend to forget the world around you a </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.683.1">little bit.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.684.1">And to be clear, to a certain extent, there’s nothing wrong with that! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.684.2">There’s nothing wrong with loving what you do, with enjoying the work. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.684.3">There’s nothing wrong with being engrossed with what </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.685.1">you’re doing.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-255"><a id="_idTextAnchor255"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.686.1">Loving your work too much</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.687.1">But it’s easy to take that too far, especially when “crunch time” hits, and that’s when it becomes dangerous. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.687.2">This is where your work/life balance sometimes goes out </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.688.1">of whack.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.689.1">You’ll sometimes encounter the phrase “death march” when it comes to development projects. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.689.2">That’s when there’s a looming deadline that </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.690.1">must</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.691.1"> be met, and you’ll sometimes find people working very long hours. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.691.2">You’ll sometimes see people putting in 12 or 14 hours a day, 7 days a week, to meet </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.692.1">that date.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.693.1">This, simply put, is dangerous, and it’s also counterproductive. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.693.2">You can’t keep your brain in high gear for too long or your productivity begins to drop precipitously. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.693.3">Even if that weren’t the case, humans are emotional beings, and the emotional toll of putting so much focus on your working life and neglecting the rest of your life leads to bad consequences at </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.694.1">some point.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.695.1">It’s a difficult thing to do when you’re starting because you don’t quite understand why it can be so destructive, and you also want to put on a good performance, so to speak. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.695.2">You don’t want to appear to be the developer who doesn’t put in the extra effort. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.695.3">You were hired, and now you’ve got to produce, and if that means extra hours, then so be it – that’s the mentality people tend to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.696.1">have naturally.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.697.1">But I strongly encourage you to fight that urge and push back when necessary. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.697.2">Don’t allow the job to become your life, unless that’s explicitly what you want, of course. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.697.3">Some people do want to live, eat, and sleep the job. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.697.4">If that’s you, then forget what I’m saying here and carry on! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.697.5">But that is generally not most people. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.697.6">Most people want a life outside of work, and you’ve</span><a id="_idIndexMarker942"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.698.1"> got to fight for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.699.1">that sometimes.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.700.1">To be clear, a few extra hours here and there shouldn’t be too big a deal. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.700.2">Sometimes, it’s necessary. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.700.3">Especially if there is a major problem with your production system, the system that the world is using to conduct business, you may have to put in a little extra time and effort to right the ship, so to speak. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.700.4">But even then, good companies will compensate you for your time – if not financially, then at least by letting you, for example, leave a bit early the next day to balance the scales. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.700.5">And you shouldn’t be shy about asking for </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.701.1">that either.</span></span></p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-256"><a id="_idTextAnchor256"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.702.1">Sussing out bad companies</span></h2>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.703.1">Not all companies are good, unfortunately, so you can’t expect it, but that’s where this part of the conversation does have some bearing on the job hunt: always remember that you’re interviewing the prospective employer just as much as they’re </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.704.1">interviewing you!</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.705.1">Ask questions about work/life balance and gauge their responses. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.705.2">Sometimes, there will be hints of a bad situation… phrases like “well, we expect everyone to put in the effort required here”, or something along those lines, might indicate an environment that doesn’t value work/life balance. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.705.3">Why? </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.705.4">Because of how one person defines “required” versus how another does. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.705.5">Of course, every employer expects a solid effort from the employees, and that’s perfectly reasonable. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.705.6">But expecting you to always go above and beyond probably isn’t. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.705.7">So, you have to figure out what </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.706.1">they mean.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.707.1">You can do that by probing a bit more in such situations and decide for yourself because there are no absolutes here, no definitive statements that will always be a red flag (aside from obvious things like “we always expect everyone to work more than 40 hours a week,” but it’ll rarely be </span><em class="italic"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.708.1">that</span></em><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.709.1"> obvious!). </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.709.2">Companies do often give away their lack of work/life balance in what they say during interviews in sometimes subtle ways – that’s the key point – and you should always be looking for such clues and probe a bit. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.709.3">Asking, for example, “How often do your engineers have to work extra hours on weekends?” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.709.4">might be one such probing question you could ask. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.709.5">An answer along the lines of “It’s very rare, only in extreme emergencies” is very different from “Well, it depends on how tight our deadlines our.” </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.709.6">The former is generally reasonable, but the latter, in my mind at least, would tend to indicate a company that doesn’t manage projects well and expects developers to pick</span><a id="_idIndexMarker943"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.710.1"> up the slack frequently. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.710.2">It probably won’t equate to a pleasant environment to </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.711.1">work in.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.712.1">Couple that with researching the company yourself and you can reach a valid conclusion. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.712.2">Sites such as Glassdoor (</span><a href="http://glassdoor.com"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.713.1">glassdoor.com</span></a><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.714.1">) are good for this because you can find anonymous feedback about </span><a id="_idIndexMarker944"/><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.715.1">a company there from actual employees of the company that can provide you solid insight into what working there might </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.716.1">be like.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.717.1">You’ll be inclined early on in your job hunt to dismiss such concerns, but I implore you not to! </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.717.2">You don’t want to find yourself hating your job a year later because you’re always having to work long hours that drain your non-working hours away. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.717.3">That’s something that leads to burnout in a hurry. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.717.4">So, don’t be afraid to ask probing questions during the interview process – do some research before and after an interview, and trust your gut. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.717.5">If an opportunity gives you pause then, no matter how much you may need a job, it’s probably best to keep looking. </span><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.717.6">Work/life balance is too important to sacrifice in </span><span class="No-Break"><span class="koboSpan" id="kobo.718.1">my opinion.</span></span></p>
